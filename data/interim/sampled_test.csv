"date","I rented this for a first date with my now boyfriend.","We matched!","His shirt was the same color blue as this dress and we both wore white sneakers.","I was smitten pretty quickly, both with him and this dress.","This dress was brand new when it got to me, tag still on.","The pockets are great and the fabric quality is phenomenal.","Thick and structured, but soft and not heavy.","I rented an 8 to be careful because this was part of unlimited and only got one size, but I could have worn a 6 without a problem.","Im only sad that I dont own this.","If things with my boyfriend keep going well, I might buy this for the sentimental value."
"date","I was not a big fan of this dress and didnt end up wearing it.","It has a lot of pretty detail but runs short and tight.","Another issue I had was the lining, which is a grey heathered sweatshirt material.","It added a thickness to the dress.","My husband said it looked like a sorority party dress which wasnt what I was going for but it could be a cute dress for the right person/ occasion."
"date","I wore size 2.","I wore a strapless bra underneath.","The material is medium thickness.","Theres no lining but I didnt have any issues with underwear lines.","I wore this for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend.","He thought it was very sexy.","I really liked how it was below the knee length but then the silt made it extra sexy and it was functional to walk in.","My boyfriend hates it when my attire slows me down as hes already 14 inches above me.","Warning: if you wear this walking down the street you will get stared at.","If my tall, large, alpha male, boyfriend wasnt present Im sure I would have gotten unwanted catcalls.","That said I would wear it again for date night."
"date","Pros:- Great quality- Fun design- ForgivingCons:- Can be a bit boxy, but that is the nature of a shift"
"date","Wore it to a lunch date and received a ton of compliments, easy fun and different then other dress I buy or rent."
"date","Fit well.","Very cute!","Material is itchy to the skin, so I wore a quarter sleeve under shirt and it worked well."
"date","I rented this as my backup dress and wore it for my birthday dinner with my husband.","It was perfect and he loved the dress!","The material is thick and the dress still looks good if you turn it backwards and wear the V neck in the front.","I wore it the regular way.","I loved this dress!"
"date","The pattern and colors on this dress really pop, and the slight flare is cute.","The material is a little funny though, it has a shine to it and it bunched up in the back.","I ordered this as a backup dress and wore it out one night for dinner but not for my main event.","Also, in the picture it looks like there is a black layer under the bottom of the skirt, but there isnt.","The fit is very flattering though, especially with the slight flare.","Overall a cute dress."
"date","I loved wearing this tight red dress, though remember to order at least a size up and to bring the bottom of it all the way up to your thigh when getting in the car, especially the high ones, otherwise the dress will break all the way up to your buttocks!!",";)"
"date","Outside layer of dress is very cool.","My boyfriend, and others loved it- doesnt look like anything else."
"date","This dress is unique and gorgeous!","It hugs you in all the right places.","We suggest sizing up.","This works best for A to C cups sizes.","It is fitted at the natural waist, and there is comfortable room for hips.","The bottom half of this dress is loose and flowy!","Perfect for a picnic or day date!","This may be worn with a standard bra.","The fabric has no stretch and is tight on the top half.","Pair this with a choker or cuff bracelet!"
"date","I loved this dress!","I was a little surprised I fit in the 8 (I got a 10 as my back up); as I have previously worn Badgley Mischka dresses in 10s.","But there is plenty of room in the bust, and I think thats why I didnt have to go up a size.","Im a 36DD and didnt feel restricted by this dress.","Also loved that I could wear a normal bra with it.","I loved the low neckline, but it was too low for the bra I was wearing so I had to safety pin it shut a bit.","Im 6 feet tall, the dress hit about mid thigh and didnt feel uncomfortably short.","Fabric is heavy, but that was kind of nice on a chilly fall evening in LA.","The sequins didnt bother me at all.","I was told I looked beautiful yet comfortable - perfect way to sum up this dress!"
"date","The dress is super cute.","However, my hips are a little wider than your average person, so I felt like it made me look bigger on the bottom.","The dress does run a little big (in my opinion) so I was able to go down to a size 6 vs the size 8 that I had ordered."
"date","This would be cute on the right body type.","I have really big boobs and I felt like they would probably pop out if I started dancing or make any sudden movements.","The length worked well with 4 inch heels.","Needless to say I didnt end up wearing it.","I think it would work great for someone with small to maybe a large C cup boobs and very petite."
"date","This dress is gorgeous.","The color is more of a bright coral (vs. red as described).","The dress came new with tags on.","The cut of this dress is great for pear-shaped women and the fabric design was incredibly figure flattering.","The only challenge that I had was that the neckline kept coming down and revealing the top of my strapless bra.","The fabric is heavy so I felt like I was constantly tugging it back in to place.","Other than that, it was fantastic."
"date","I loved this dress!","The sleeves were fit but not too snug which is a big concern for most of the dresses on this site.","The lower part is stretchy but snug so I didnt need to wear my spanx.","You will need a strapless bra for sure.","I got so many compliments all night.","It really hugs your waist making an hourglass figure out of any body type.","Also the back is killer.","My fiance says he wishes I would have bought it!"
"date","I loved the color and the fabric on this dress.","I got it in a 44 and probably would have liked it a tad better in the 42, but even a little large this dress looked great on.","I wore it for a date night with my husband and it was definitely an eye-catcher.","I didnt receive any compliments (other than plenty from my husband!)","but overall I felt very sexy and confident.","It is a little too long for my height, even with 6 inch heels, as it went slightly below my knees.","Anyone shorter than 51 (even if wearing heels) should be warned that this will be a calf-length dress."
"date","I didnt wear this unfortunately, the sleeves were way too long"
"date","Definitely recommend this dress.","Material  for soft and hugs your curves!"
"date","Whimsical assemble - great for a casual look."
"date","Rented this for dinner with Friends for my 50th Birthday and felt fabulous.","The length through the torso and skirt were perfect; which is often difficult with Rent the Runway gowns.","Was a fun dress to wear for a summer night out and I received many compliments."
"date","Dress was a little short for my taste.","Went with the 6 so I could be more comfortable in the dress.","Also, if you want no panty lines...no panties.","I wore a regular bra with the dress.","Definitely comfortable and no risk of slipping out of the dress."
"date","I rented this for my 30th birthday where my husband surprised me with a trip to Chicago to see Hamilton.","I was antsy about the low back as Im not the thinnest in the world but felt comfortable, sexy, and confident in this all night.","I went braless which I wouldnt normally do but the front was tight enough to hold me in.","The lace hit right at my knee and the dress itself is pretty short but kept me covered.",";) The lacy was soft, not itchy.","Only thing to caution is to just be careful with the hook and eye closures that they dont snag on any of the lace."
"date","This dress fits very comfortably with elastic around the waist.","I love the open back.","Its very simple however and isnt something Id normally spend money to rent, but was my free birthday dress.","I was just going out to dinner so it was perfect for that.","The front is very simple, plain full coverage."
"date","Unfortunately, my preferred size (8) was not able to ship.","The size 10 was a bit big, which meant I had to keep hoiking it up, but it fit well enough.","The dress is very comfortable, especially given how sexy it is.","Nice thick fabric and lining.","It was perfect for my birthday dinner out and I received many compliments.","Definitely a stunner!"
"date","Wore it with high waisted shorts and nude heals.","For a petite frame like me, the shoulders were too wide and the arms were way too long.","Because of the material, I couldnt fold the sleeves up.","It is a mesh base so youll need a skin colored bra.","On a scale of ten, my boyfriend and I settled on a 6."
"date","I never wore this dress - but did snap a pic when I tried it on before I sent it back the next day.","Love the whole body of the dress, but the top chest area was super tight and the lace around the neckline was super flimsy and didnt look good.","Not sure if its a boob size issue (Im 34DD) or maybe I needed a larger size to get a better top fit?","I couldnt wear a bra and the dress had no boob perk support either.","So maybe better for a smaller chested girl."
"date","I dont know if the dress runs small or if I was bloated that day but I couldnt zip the dress all the way.","I still wore it with a jacket because its so gorgeous but will definitely size up next time."
"date","Soo many compliments, fits true to size and not too short.","If I could I would buy this dress, a great LBD to have in the closet!"
"date","It took a bit to get the 34DDs tucked in.","I couldnt wear a bra but it wasnt a big deal.","A like flattened, but certainly held in place.","Tried going up to the L but it wasnt any easier and then it was loose at the rib cage."
"date","This shirt is very unique and a great color!","I wore it with jeans and heels for a date night with my husband.","Its very light weight and the sleeves are open so I think I will rent it again in the spring.","The way the shirt is designed you cant always tell that the underside of the sleeves are open which makes it really different.","Loved it!"
"date","this runs true to size.","The dress is extremely comfortable, very light and airy.","Unfortunately the New York weather did not cooperate so i will be renting this again!"
"date","Looked fabulous in this!","The color is gorgeous and length is just right.","This dress is very structured at the waist, and the arms have no give."
"date","I rented this dress for my husband and Is second wedding anniversary.","It had a bit of stretch, which was nice.","And pockets, which are always a huge plus!","Would be perfect for a bridal shower!"
"date","Very classy dress, great to play down with limited adornment or play up with fabulous accessories.","I am 36H 27 42 and usually wear a medium in Herve.","This was a bit tighter in the breast area, especially since the fabric was not quite as bandage as HL usually is (I liked the lighter material), but naturally busty girls will need a bra with this one."
"date","Such a fun, flirty little dress!!","Another one Id love to own and wear again and again.","The fabric has some give to it, so thats a big positive.","I didnt feel uncomfortable in it (even after a big steak dinner) :-) The white ruffle makes this dress super unique and unlike any dress Ive rented before."
"date","I appreciate the concept of this outfit because it provides a formal look with the jacket and it also states fun and casual with the shorts and sheer fabric.","I ordered both S & M and wanted to take the S top of the outfit and put it with the M bottoms.","The top is very loose in the bust area and reveals a lot of skin and can even expose a few lady parts if you dont arrange the top to fit your body.","The bottoms were a bit snug for me because I wore the S. If I wore the M, the top would have been out of control too large.","Overall, a good outfit."
"date","I was nervous about the fit at first.","I thought the 6 would be a better fit but it was loose.","The size 4 was perfect because the dress did not fall off my shoulders.","It was a little short, but not uncomfortably short."
"date","RTR had contacted me to let me know that the previous renter had not returned the belt, and had me choose a back-up.","After trying both, I loved how this made me feel so I just added my own belt.","I wanted to define my waist, but the belt isnt a requirement.","I wore shapewear underneath just to smooth everything out as the fabric does cling.","I was able to manage the zipper by myself.","I would rent this again."
"date","Fun top but even better w/ the skirt."
"date","I was a little worried about this dress when i ordered it... all those sparkles, am i goining to look trashy?","Its so short and I am tall is it going to cover everything?","I took a chance and ordered it cause I thought it was cute inexpensive and it wasnt for an important event.","When I got it and tried it on it looked amazing on me and I felt like it drew just the right amount of attention being so sparkly.","It was pretty short but I am not afraid to show off some leg and you just have to mind yourself sitting down and bending over like any lady should if shes wearing any dress.","The fit was good it was a little big though I am kind of inbetween sizes 0 or 2 , so I always order both.","The 0 is usually a little tight and 2 is usually a little big but to my surprise the 0 fit well and was even a little loose in some places.","If you have a very small figure like myself you should keep in mind that it might be  little roomy in the hips and stomach but it wont look unflattering."
"date","Pretty dress, great color however it was so large I couldnt wear it, it was falling off of me.","I am 53 tall  and weigh 118 lbs with 32C bust and the size 2 was enormous.","Size down 1-2 sizes in this dress, trust me!"
"date","Very short in the front; must wear with high waisted skirt or shorts.","Pulling it down isnt an option since the v is so low."
"date","This is a great dress for tall women, especially!","It is a flirty, fun style and I felt great in it.","I wore this on a date night in Brooklyn and didnt feel overdressed in the slightest."
"date","Comfortable, flattering, great feeling-fabric and beautiful design -- I really couldnt have been happier, which was nice because the last couple of dresses I rented werent great on me.","When I first put it on, I thought a 4 may have been better (instead of a 2) but as I relaxed, it seemed to fit better and better.","Id be very tempted to buy it if it werent so pricey.","At least I can rent .",".",".","!"
"date","Gorgeous dress that is flirty but also very flattering.","It is slightly tight in the shoulders, but otherwise fits perfectly!"
"date","Fit was 100% true to size, read the reviews any i agree the material is a bit thicker than youd expect, but it was fine.","I wore this in late August for my birthday dinner with my BF.","Didnt have to wear a bra, but there was enough room to wear one for anyone who prefers to.","Loved this romper, would 100% rent again!"
"date","I loved the patterned and the sleeves on this dress.","I also loved the deep low cut front.","Unfortunately the dress didnt really fit with my curvy hips well.","It was lose in the waist but super tight around my hips which looked strange since it is meant to be flowy.","I feel like if I went a size up it would have looked like a tent on me."
"date","This dress is fabulous.","Im wearing it with black open-toe Paul Green booties for a date, and may wear it again for a wedding in July.","The flared skirt makes it appear shorter than it actually is, which is great for me as Im 52 and this dress hits just above the knee.","The material is just so amazing; Im so used to being let down by higher end designers with their material choices, but thats never the case with Alexis.","I may even buy this dress."
"date","No Cons."
"date","A good dress for slim figures, size 6 will accommodate natural waist 26 and below.","This dress is a perfect choice for an autumn tea party.","Not recommended for women with love handles."
"date","Wore this to the horse races then out to dinner & a music festival.","Got tons of compliments.","One from a guy I accidentally flashed when boarding a train.","Be careful- this is SHORT!","And Im only 5.","Will definitely rent again!"
"date","I was incredibly excited to get this dress!","Unfortunately I wasnt able to actually wear it.","The overall size fits fairly true to the designer, but ladies with larger busts should definitely consider going up a size.","Good news is the dress is outfitted with an internal strap system, so you can go bra-less!"
"date","Super fun - back is beautiful!","Would rent again!"
"date","This dress is to be worn with an up-do and no bra, if you ask me.","I wore it with a long string of crocheted fresh water pearls and black four inch Calvin Klein ankle strap heals.","Pictures are coming soon."
"date","Wore the dress for a date night.","We went to a top rated restaurant in NYC, followed by dancing at a jazz club.","Paired with a sweater, the dress was beautiful and appropriate for the more conservative restaurant.","Without the sweater, the dress had great flow and was subtly sexy; perfect for upscale dancing.","Received so many compliments!","And the fit was very comfortable.","Fitted but flexible; able to expand during dinner and move with me during dancing.","Final Review: I felt absolutely beautiful and classy in this dress."
"date","It fits the body true to size, but is a little too long in the straps.","I pinned them in the back.","Really a beautiful dress.","Could be dressed up or made more casual depending on accessories."
"date","curve hugging dress.","I wish i could have worn it, but the top ruching laid weird on my bust.","I wouldnt recommend it if you have more than a DD cup size."
"date","Dress is super basic from the front, but the back is very cute.","Fits a little large near the armpit/bust area."
"date","Pros: beautiful shade of red, universally flattering Cons: slit is SUPER high, this dress will not work if youre not feeling confident or event requires modest attire"
"date","Really liked this dress.","Looks a bit boring before you put it on but it really was lovely.","Fabric was really comfortable and dress was soft but it still had a lot of structure to help define my waist and create nice lines.","Would be appropriate for work as well."
"date","Less dressy than I thought it would be.","I rented this as a part of unlimited and I was happy with it to have around the weekend, I immediately returned it on Monday.","The sides are not actually see through as I thought but have a nude fabric, which might be weird if your skin tone is different than that of the panel.","Also the flaps in the back were a bit weird."
"date","fits true to size.","im 58 and the SR was perfect length even with wedges."
"date","Fit beautifully, loved it, wish I could wear everyday :)"
"date","Amazing color and super fun fit"
"date","I usually wear a 8 petite so I went with the large based on other reviews.","The dress felt great!","I did have to keep adjusting because the straps were a bit long on me, but the length was nice.","I took the picture without adjusting so my fellow short-torso ladies can plan accordingly.","I wouldve worn a plunge bra if I had one.","I might have been able to wear the medium but I was going to a really good restaurant and I didnt want to be constricted!","My measurements when I wore the dress were: Widest part of my bust: 42inUnderbust: 33inWasit: 33inHips: 45in"
"date","Loved it!"
"date","Wore this to my birthday dinner.","The printed eyelet was really on-trend.","The bell sleeves and drop waist made this look unique.","Loved wearing this!"
"date","I had been dreaming of wearing this dress for months!","I decided to wear it to a celebratory steak dinner with my fiance.","The 8 was very form fitting especially in the bust and the hips.","Needless to say, I was feeling like maaaaaybe I should have gotten the next size up and my fiance was VERY INTO the one I had on.","The fabric was much more slippery and heavier than I had thought it would be, but in some ways that was nice, as it hid little bumps and bulges."
"date","I really like this dress.","It can be really dressy or just moderately.","I wore it to a very nice dinner on vacation.","The one warning I would give is that if you are busty, the top part is not very big and you may end up overflowing as I did.","Lots of cleavage here!"
"date","runs a bit short, so I wore a black cami underneath.","Nice contrasting stitching."
"date","This dress looked amazing - the color and pattern are gorgeous.","The pleats held up all night!","I loved it and I got a ton of compliments that night and on fb afterwards!"
"date","Every head turned when I walked by in this dress!","La Petite Robe de Chiara Boni knows exactly how to design a dress that makes a woman feel sexy, sophisticated, and powerful all in one packaging.","I will be purchasing this dress!"
"date","I got the size small and the fit was true to size.","Arrived new with the tags on.","Very close fit, but the fabric is stretchy, so it was not tight.","Im tall and the length was just above my knee.","However, this dress hit me at my widest point (hips), and then the cut got tighter as it went to my knees.","So my pear shape was super pair shaped in this.","If the cut was straight down and didnt get narrower then I would have loved it.","Overall, I wouldnt recommend it for other pear shaped ladies!","But if you are uniformly curvey then it would look great."
"date","I felt so great wearing this dress I even wore it all day from the office (with a cute jacket) to a date at a concert.","Even though its form-fitting, the material smooths all flaws.","Its a beautiful rich color."
"date","Fits true to size very classy and elegant"
"date","The fit was perfect.","Im 52, so it hit right at the knee - seems shorter on the model."
"date","I fit into the 8, but I went with the 10 for a four course meal with wine.",":)  The pattern is beautiful and different from all other dresses.","The tulle lays flat so you will not have visions of a ballerina tutu.","If you have a large chest, you may have to size up."
"date","This dress was perfect.","I didnt want to take it off."
"date","I rented this shirt for a dinner date and it was perfect!","The material is well made and great for a winter night.","The shirt is simple but the sleeve detail made it fun to wear.","Would definitely recommend!"
"date","This dress was a great length and fit my midsection like a dream- but was loose and baggy almost floppy around the collar, not a dress for a small busted person"
"date","I wore this for a valentines dinner date in Chicago.","Since Ive got a shorter frame, I felt the sleeves were a little long and fussed with them throughout the night.","I loved the color and long sleeves, so I didnt have to keep myself bundled in my coat all evening at the restaurants open air  patio.","The dress was a little roomy and wasnt as fitted as the photos led me to believe."
"date","I wore this classy dress to dinner with my husband on Christmas Eve.","I wore a strapless bra with it - it has a lovely bateau neck.","It does have smidgen of stretch.","The 12 fit, but the 14 was more flattering on my curvy (wide-hipped) figure."
"date","This is a super tight fitting material-think spandex - but it is extremely thick and of a high quality, keeping everything in place without seeing wrinkles or underwear lines.","It fit really well, I wasnt popping out despite my being a 34D, and at 55 it was the perfect length with a low heel.","I am 112-114 lbs and of athletic build for reference.","I wouldnt recommend this length for anyone with any amount of hips (I have none) as it will significantly cinch the pant legs up.","Got a lot of compliments!","Only con is, as everyone has said, difficulty in pulling it down to use the restroom, but I did it - with a 1 year old in my arms- so you can make it work if you want it badly enough (and you should!)","Would definitely rent again."
"date","If fits true to size.","Is slightly cropped, so I would recommend wearing with high waist pants or skirt.","A little darker peach than in the photo.","Overall - great top!"
"date","This dress is lovely with impressive details of  velvet intertwined with sequins.","However, it was so uncomfortable and itchy.","It made my skin crawl wearing it just trying it on.","A little big of an awkward fit.","I would say this is better for women with a larger bust size.","I am kind of small so it was tight on hips but a little big up top.","I was sad it didnt work for me :("
"date","Its not the dresses fault.","But the odd dispersement of fat on me.","Or maybe I have body issues but i think if you dont have a great back.","Meaning little back fat then this dress isnt for you.","This dress is beautifully and smartly constructed.","When you wear the black strap in the back you dont need to wear a bra.","However, unlucky me the bra bulge is never more apparent when fully shown bare like with dress."
"date","Very comfortable; easy to dress up or down.","Looks and feels well made.","Simple black with white stripes, but the pattern really pops."
"date","I always wear 0 size dress, however some dresses can be very tight, which after a dinner date make you feel terrible.","I got the Small just in case, but the XS was perfect.","And its beautiful."
"date","This dress makes your curves look phenomenal!","It fits a little small on the rib cage/chest area so ladies with a larger bust ,might need to size up (I am 34C).","I didnt wear a bra and needed my husbands help zipping the dress up but I must say it was worth the effort.","The color is a maroon/burgundy tone that is perfect for fall.","I paired it with the Rebecca Minkoff blush jacket and nude shoes for an outfit to remember.","I would love to rent this dress again!"
"date","Operas are hard because some people go super formal and others go casual.","This dress cut right down the middle-- the length was casual, but the detailing and fabric was formal.","Fabric was thick and heavy, great for winter, and the dress was lovely and very flattering."
"date","I rented this dress for my 40th birthday.","I usually wear a medium, but there were only smalls available on the date I needed.","I went ahead and rented it, but chose a back-up dress just in case.","To my delight it fit GREAT.","The dress has just enough stretch that a small was actually perfect.","The compliments were endless and made me feel fabulous on my 40th!","THANK YOU RTR!"
"date","The dress was modest (e.g., bust, arms, hem length), but the lace and fit made it very sexy."
"date","The dress was definitely on the tight side when I tried it on, until I adjusted my chest.","I didnt need to wear a bra, since the dress had great structure.","(The neckline has wire in it, which is how it holds its shape.)","The dress does make it very obvious if its not centered properly, though, so be careful how you move and shift when youre wearing it.","Had a great night!"
"date","The dress was perfect for the occasion.","It fit like a glove and minimized my mid-section.","I loved the small cut-out.","Most people thought it was a belt at first, so it is a very tasteful cut-out for those of us in our 30s!"
"date","Wore on a long overdue date night with the bf and friends.","Im not usually a jumpsuit kind of gal, but I love Parker, and I love that RTR Unlimited lets me take more risks.","This one was fun and a different look for me.","Runs long -- even with considerable heels, though Im definitely on the short side.","I reduced the openness of the back with a little double sided tape, which worked great."
"date","A bit tight on the behind but super cute print!"
"date","I loved this top.","I would not normally pick this color but I loved it on.","It was a happy accident that my first selection was not available and this was my backup top.","I would rent it again.","Loved the asymmetry of it."
"date","Wore this to my sorority formal which is holiday themed.","I loved the dress, definitely could have worn the small except for the length.","It was SO SHORT!!","I mean it wouldve shown everything even though its sort of fit and flare and not really tight.","The medium was fine.","Hard to wear a bra because the back is a little low.","Overall I really loved it!"
"date","Ran small on me.","The Length was perfect with a wedge.","The medium in my didnt have any wiggle room.","I will rent this again and try the Large and medium.","I had to press this when it arrived because it was so wrinkled from being mailed."
"date","Fun LBD.","Fitted look yet super comfortable due to stretchy material."
"date","It is a little short so this is great for a date night.","I dressed it down by using turquoise and silver accessories and black leather high heeled mules.","It looked fabulous, so much so that I will be buying the dress.","Loved it!"
"date","The deep v was a little to low cut for my liking.","I have a larger chest and you could see my bra.","Also, the arms and chest are cut narrow.","Couldnt lift up my arms comfortably to put my hair in a ponytail.","The fit in all other places was very roomy and the length was not too short."
"date","Ive worn Shoshanna before and it fit great so thats why I ordered it again.","The front was lower cut than I anticipated, but wasnt too revealing.","The length was great and the color was amazing.","And this dress has pockets!"
"date","I love the feminine lace details and the versatility of this dress.","My one downside is the cut was not flattering on me (pear shaped body here), however I could see how it would be lovely on others!","Good for any time of year!"
"date","This was snug around the waist and does run small, but overall, perfect for date night."
"date","Could dress it up with fancy shoes or dress it down with sandals.","Classic colors and really lovely details.","I had fun wearing it on a date night and will rent it again!","!"
"date","I dressed this up with a loose white pair of pants and wow, feeling instantly sexy and confident to win hearts tonight."
"date","This dress was exactly what I was looking for - it is a beautiful coral/orange color and fit it great.","I wore the size 4, which fit perfectly.","The lace is soft, not itchy and the dress is perfect for a larger bust.","The skirt was a bit fuller than I expected - its a very forgiving dress.","The lining is a bit too long and pokes out at times (you can see it in the picture) but the dress hit me perfectly right above my knee.","Its definitely not as short as it looks on the model."
"date","I had been nervous about the sizing of a jumpsuit as I usually wear a size larger on bottom than on top.","However, the pleated hips made it very roomy and comfortable, and it could not have fit better.","I definitely felt like all eyes were on me that night, and I was sorry to have to return it the next day.","I would say that Im 56 and the legs were less cropped than I expected from the photos, but it still worked fine with booties."
"date","This dress is pretty provocative!","I didnt feel comfortable wearing it outside my hotel room without a cover-up.","If I were going to a hot club in Las Vegas or Miami, maybe it would be a different story.","But I really cant imagine being comfortable in this in any other setting.","It was super short and the cut-outs are large.","Maybe if I were 10 years younger and not a mom ... lol."
"date","This one fit well, and the hemline was flattering.","Im a little heavier at the moment than I prefer, so I wasnt a huge fan of the way the bodice looked on me.","My husband said I was overreacting and that it looked fine, so once I lose a little, Ill rent again, and give it another whirl, because it really is a cute dress."
"date","I felt like a well-dressed spy.","A little understated and very sexy.","Perfect for a cooler evening, the dress is warm.","The hemline is on the shorter side but because it has sleeves it doesnt look scandalous."
"date","Fit was great!","The cut was perfect and super cute.","Length wasnt as short as I thought but it was still a little above my knees."
"date","True to size, maybe a bit snug for curvier builds."
"date","I LOVED this dress!","The fabric is a super soft scuba material and it stretched in all the right places but still fit like a glove!","I really liked the length and the sexy cut outs.","Rent this dress!"
"date","Ah - Im bummed.","I ordered for a date but I wont be able to wear it.","Other reviews say it ran true to size but I find it to be small in the chest and ribcage area.","It is adorable - but if I were you I would order one size up.","The other dresses I ordered fit great (unfortunately they arent a date dress).","Ill have to order it again in a larger size."
"date","I normally wear a 0-2 or XS, but it runs a bit small so I opted for a S.  It fit perfectly.","The length is great and the dress is super comfortable."
"date","True to size, the elastic has a good amount of give to it and it very true to size"
"date","I had some pretty serious hesitations about this dress given that I was unable to wear a bra with it - but the dress fit PERFECTLY.","The band under the bust acted like a bra, so I was never at all concerned that I would give anyone an accidental show.","The cutouts hit at the perfect place, there was no chance of any muffin top or anything (and I ate a lot while wearing this dress) and the bottom was forgiving at the hips.","I loved this dress, I was so sad to send it back!","I paired it with black opaque tights, black patent heels and a white bubble necklace.","You wont regret renting this dress!"
"date","I rented this dress for a romantic birthday date in NYC with my boyfriend.","I received so many compliments just from wearing it for the night!","I fell in love with the dress online and trust me--its 100x better in person!","I was initially concerned about the tight sleeves but they ended up being perfect!"
"date","It was short on me, but the coverage on top helped to class it up.","The lace back and cutouts added that extra dash of sexy.","It is somewhat tight, but just enough to keep everything in place and smoothed out.","I am a thicker / curvier and I loved the slimming effect it offered.","It was the perfect dress for a fun music event and date night."
"date","this dress is perfect for a simple everyday date night outfit.","I got compliments all night and the dress was very flattering for my frame.","My Husband LOVED it which says a lot!"
"date","I love my body in this dress.","Is Nha Khan my new DVF?","The back of this dress is the clincher.","It frames the back beautifully -- the button on top accentuates the upper back, and theres a piece of fabric that clasps to loosely cover the lower back.","I felt very sexy!","The lace cutouts at the waist were a good way for me to play with the trend towards visible midsections.","I rented this for my boyfriends birthday.","He appreciated it.","My only wish is that Id had sheer control top tights for the evening."
"date","I ordered this look for the Beyonce and Jay-Z concert at the Rose Bowl, which is an outdoor venue in Pasadena, California.","I wanted to try the 8, but RTR was out so I got the 10 and the 12.","Didnt even try the 12 on since the 10 was slightly roomy.","I guess I didnt realize the black bustier type insert came with it...would probably be sexier without!","Its not exactly supportive, so if you have a large bust you will need a strapless bra, but I went without just fine.","There are some discomfort issues that comes with sequins - my clutch kept snagging on it, and it got a little irritating between the thighs and under the arms, but I wasnt surprised given the material.","I did not have any issues with the boning as I have read in some other reviews.","Got a lot of compliments and felt appropriate for the venue - very fun outfit for a night out on the town.","Note the color doesnt photograph true - looks more silver in pics but its a true gold!"
"date","Very form fitting.","Im 54 and this hit right above my knees."
"date","Sexy neckline and pockets, this dress has both a fun and sexy element.","The shine and pattern are also beautiful and unique.","No bra or a Nubra is necessary due to the very deep v in the front.","As the material has no stretch I recommend going up a size for the back up.","I highly recommend for a fun night out."
"date","This is one of my absolute favorite rentals.","I usually wear a size 4 top, size 6 bottom.","I have long legs, a short torso, and a small waist and a sizable butt.","I wore the SL and it fit like a GLOVE.","Seriously it was like it was sewn onto my body in the best way... which is a good thing because there is not much stretch to this piece.","I am 57, wore 3 heels and the length was perfect.","All in all this is one of the best things Ive ever put on my body and will definitely rent again!"
"date","This dress was very high quality.","The zipper was a little hard to get up but the rest of the dress was beautiful.","The lining underneath is stretchy which was nice.","The dress itself does not have stretch.","The waistband was a little snug but doable.","The sleeves were just big enough to give you room to move around without being too tight.","Overall great dress.","Classy, perfect for a date, wedding or a night out dancing with friends."
"date","Enjoyed my first RTR experience.","Unfortunately, Ive gained a little weight (8lbs?)","since starting law school PT and working FT, so as other reviewers noted the arms/shoulder are a little tight so I went with the 4.","The waist of this dress didnt really hit my waist and with my rib cage being kinda big and straight (it doesnt taper like a narrow waisted hour-glass figure), I needed the bigger size.","I loved the quality of the dress and the lace so pretty.","The dress has some pleats all around it, but not too flouncy.","Wasnt the hubbys favorite since he didnt think it flattered my figure well-enough (didnt show off my butt).","Had to wear sheer hosiery - its MN sub-zero in Jan, couldnt go bare legged.","Also found some great unique peep toe heels of suede leather appropriate for the weather!","Was going to wear my hair up in a low chignon, to show-off the pretty back - but due to time constraints I was unable to style my hair.","Next time, I hope to try something a bit more daring - not a problem to try something you might not normally buy with RTR!"
"date","This great fit perfectly.","The fabric is a bit weighted, which I thought was great for a nice winter date.","You could easily dress this up for a nice event."
"date","Like the other reviewers mentioned, youre going to need someone else to help you zip this up over the middle section- its seriously impossible to do by yourself.","The dress isnt split all the way down to the zipper like the picture on the model.","Its too low cut that I wouldnt wear it to a wedding (although maybe smaller chested girls could get away with it!)","but it was a seriously hot date night dress.","Loved it, and will definitely rent again."
"date","The fit was true to size.","The sleeves were  maybe a little tight, but still very comfortable.","Very appropriate for a dinner date!","Loved this dress!","!"
"date","Cant explain why but I love asymmetrical tops and this one did not disappoint.","This felt very comfortable, the weight was perfect for fall.","There are slits on the side that come up kind of high which was fine for date night but I will probably wear with a cami when I wear it to the office this week.","Simple but classy, love it."
"date","Very comfortable dress, loose cut, romantic and chic.","Got a lot of attention!"
"date","Beautiful style, very classy and elegant, perfect for a night out to celebrate the BFs birthday."
"date","This was my back up to my back up dress for our familys Xmas card photo shoot.","I had selected 2 styles and my daughter picked the other dress for the photo shoot.","This one was just too pretty to NOT wear, so we went out to a nice dinner just so I could wear this dress.","It was super comfortable and the length was perfect (Im 56 and wore a 4 heel).","Would highly recommend this dress!"
"date","I love everything about this jumper except that it is damaged.","Theres a big snag in the mesh.","If it wasnt for that I would have bought it I loved how it fit."
"date","I normally wear a medium, but I ended up wearing the large size of this dress, as it was a bit tight in the hips."
"date","The stitching on the leaves really makes this a cute skirt.","I love that it was high-waisted, but I had to size up to a 42 since it runs a bit small.","It is already lined and the fabric is pretty thick, so great for winter and it looks good with tights, too!"
"date","I rented this for a fun date night (with my birthday coupon!)","I wanted to try something new.","I am Not a jumpsuit kind of girl.","I am glad I took a chance with this one.","I felt a bit weird at first, but when my friends told me how cute and fashionable it looked I felt better.","I am always afraid of jumpsuits making your tooshy look huge, but this one didnt.","It was comfortable, though the button in the back is very hard to get to.","I am 56 so it was less of an ankle length than I was hoping, but some fashion tape solved that.","I would rent this one again."
"date","Only negative is the material is pretty heavy..","Otherwise I loved everything about it"
"date","Runs a little large.","Also the seam sometimes sticks out.","Nice fabric, great color to wear with dark jeans.","I guess I should have ordered the XS instead of the S."
"date","This dress is beautiful, flatters the natural waistline, and according to my husband shows off your boobs."
"date","If you have long legs skip it, but otherwise it is fab"
"date","This is a very flattering dress, so long as youre not moving.","I was constantly pulling the dress to the right, as the left shoulder strap kept pulling it to the left, exposing my adhesive bra.","There is also no split in the skirt, making steps somewhat of a concentrated task.","With that said, I still received a ton of compliments.","I dont think anyone noticed my struggles...lol"
"date","Jay Godfrey runs a little small on jump suits, maybe because Im 56.","The top needs double sided tape and a nu bra, bring extra tape for bathroom breaks.","The color and material are gorgeous!","I paired with white peep toe shoes and dangling earrings."
"date","I ended up adding a belt with it, but this was so comfortable and sexy.","I would rent again and it is great for a fun night out :)"
"date","This was a beautiful, cool dress with a lot of casual drama.","Perfect for a Friday night al fresco dinner with friends.","Im a bit buxom--34D--and the top offers less than maximal coverage--but Im fine with a little bosom showing."
"date","This dress was so cute and it was actually surprisingly comfortable!","I liked that it was thick fabric, but the sleeves were a different material.","It was pretty and unique.","My typical size 8 fit perfectly, if anything a little on the smaller size.","One thing that I would note is that it was shorter than I expected it to be.","Maybe a little short for work, but not so short that Id be uncomfortable wearing it for an everyday occasion.","I also love the bright print against the black background!"
"date","Obsessed!!!!","I love this style so much.","I cant wait to rent it again!","It looks beautiful on and I felt amazing in it.","It does run a bit snug, I would certainly recommend sizing up for backup.","The color is a very bold blue and really pops!","This would require either a strapless bra or no bra for the off shoulder look."
"date","Very straight fit.","The arms are very restrictive, looks cute but makes it difficult to dance in.","Overall I really like the dress style and fit."
"date","beading is very nice"
"date","I received this dress as a replacement, however, it wasnt formal enough for my event.","The pictures of this dress online make it appear to be more formal than it really is.","The fabric is made of wool and the dress has side pockets, which gives it more of a low-key look.","The top is fitted and flattering, however, the bottom is very loose and flowing.","This is a great outfit for a day out with your girlfriends, brunch or a casual date.","The wool makes the skirt really warm, so it is good for cold weather."
"date","Fit and looked great"
"date","based on reviews I ordered an XS even though im usually an S/size 4. it was still a bit large, but the top fit ok.","I would recommend going down at least 1 size for this dress.","I found the armholes to be a little large so opted to wear a crew neck long sleeve black shirt underneath and it looked awesome!","ended up looking like a colorblock dress.","hit mid thigh, need to wear a strapless.","color is great, not the most flattering for my body type."
"date","This dress was really cute.","I rented this because I thought I could wear a normal bra with it, but with the size 2 it ended up showing a little through the cuts in the side.","So I went up to the 4 and it didnt show.","The black is the 2, I ended up wearing the 4  in Pink.","It was perfect for date night!"
"date","The slit is a nice touch as its a pretty loose dress.","Paired it with a short jacket and a statement necklace for a nice Christmas date.","Easy fit."
"date","Fun, beautiful.","Great for small waist and bigger bum.","I belted it with a thick brown leather belt.","Went to just above the floor on me (53).","Loved the sleeves.","Wore several times and would rent again."
"date","I typically wear a US 2, but wore a 10 (UK) in this dress.","Definitely order a size, if not 2 (!!)","up.","I got the 8 as well and couldnt zip it over my chest (and I dont have much of one).","That said, this dress is gorgeous.","Wore it out to dinner and drinks for my boyfriends birthday.","Its a head turner, but really comfortable and sexy but not risque.","Would absolutely rent again."
"date","Rented this for a special date with my boyfriend.","Dress fit well and was very flattering.","Didnt especially like how small the side cutouts were.","Made the dress look more boring and plain than expected"
"date","Gorgeous!","SUPER low in the front yet the bow keeps it classy.","Traveled with this and it did not wrinkle- YES.","Loved it!"
"date","This dress was actually my back up dress but I ended up liking it more than my first choice!","It was the perfect length for me.","Im short and prefer my dresses a little longer so it worked out perfectly.","It fit very comfortably.","My 34F bust was able to fit comfortably and wasnt squished.","Really enjoyed wearing it!"
"date","So Im a petite girl and this was super long on me, but the rest of the fit was great and true to size.","I love the feminine print with sexy cutout.","From the waist up this looked amazing.","The length didnt stop me from wearing it out to dinner with my husband.","Another great unlimited pick!","!"
"date","This was my first off-the-shoulder dress rental and I loved it!","The color was a nice rich blue and the sleeves were fun.","The cut of the dress was flattering.","My only complaint is that the front of the dress would not lay completely flat, allowing the hanger loops to peek out (if you look closely at my picture you can see what Im talking about)."
"date","For my trip to Las Vegas, I rented two sizes of this dress, but ended up wearing the smaller of the two.","This dress was great!","It had a ton of energy and was extremely comfortable!","The only thing to note is that the lining inside of the dress does ride up a lot, but everything else was great.","Great dress!","Had a hard time returning this one :)"
"date","This shirt has some give which made it very comfortable.","The length hit right at the top of the hip.","I loved the style of the top of this shirt.","Very modern and feminine."
"date","Rented the dress for a date night.","I ordered my normal size and it was HUGE!","Luckily I had ordered another dress as well because this one was too big to even wear."
"date","This dress fit me perfect and I did not feel over dressed for my date just right for a fancy restaurant"
"date","this is an awesome jumper, I wore it one time to a day party with flats and another time to a concert in heels, both times got a million compliments... best part is that it is SOOO comfy!"
"date","The dress fit like a glove!","I ordered the 4 and the 2 and felt like both would have been OK, but the 2 was a less baggy fit.","It was a tad scratchy on my arms due to the sequins, but thats just the price you pay for the sparkle!","Loved this dress!"
"date","Although this wasnt EXACTLY what I was hoping for, it was cute and fun.","It wasnt as short as I thought it might be (as it is on the model), and also not as form-fitting.","The 2 was pretty large and the 4 was way too big on me.","If I had ordered a size down I may have liked the fit better.","The sleeves are awesome and unique, and you barely need any accessories with this dress - just some standout heels and notice-me earrings :)  - I wish I had photographed it without my jacket!","!"
"date","The dress runs small.","I typically wear a 2 but had to wear the size 4 instead.","It is comfortable and does not rise when walking (big plus for me - I hate tugging on a dress all night long).","The dress is much prettier in person than on the website.","I paired it with red heels and gold accessories.","I hated to return the dress and would rent again."
"date","This dress was a great fit and winter appropriate.","The tailored waistline really gives the dress a beautiful cut and accentuates your natural form.","Beautiful, would rent again!"
"date","Fun dress!","Form fitting but thick fabric makes you feel confident.","The color and pattern is FUN!"
"date","This we a beautiful dress for dressing up or dressing down.","The very low V created some challenges with my bra showing.","The fit was just a bit snug, but I still managed to wear my regular size."
"date","I really loved this dress.","I wore it to a celebratory date with my husband at a fancy restaurant.","I planned to wear the six, but it arrived with a broken clasp, so I opted for the four, which was fine.","The whole dress fit very comfortably, including the numerous straps.","Really enjoyed wearing this."
"date","Wore it for a dinner date with my husband in Vegas and he was totally floored!",":) :)Love love loved the turquoise color and the feel of the fabric.","I ordered it when there was no review on the site and was pleasantly surprised with the look of the dress.","I normally wear size 8 and hadnt ordered a backup.","The size 8 was lil body hugging near the tummy and I would have loved to get size 10.","But still went ahead with a Spanx because it was so beautiful!","I wish I didnt have to return it...","But overall a gorgeous dress!"
"date","I liked this dress a lot.","The fabric was thick and the lace was pretty.","The dress hit me around the bottom of my knees.","I found that the color was darker in person than how it appears in the models photo.","My only complaint is that the waist is not very well-defined on this dress, so it wasnt snug enough around the middle section for me in order to show off the see through section of the dress."
"date","I wore this for a date-night with boots, but it could be dressed up with accessories etc.","Hard to wear a bra, so keep that in mind, I have a smaller chest so this wasnt an issue."
"date","It was a little boxy for my figure.","Im very hourglass curvy and it just didnt look good on me.","I was sad because it was so lovely."
"date","nice stretch to it, form fitting but comfortable.","I am 57 130 lbs and 4 fit nicely.","2 also fit but just not as comfortable and 4 was still nicely fitted"
"date","This was the perfect fit for my 5 frame, most jumpers are so long, but since this has a crop leg it was a great length.","It was really comfortable, true to size, and the best part my husband thought I looked amazing in it.","I wore it for my anniversary dinner date.","The only draw back is you really cant wear a bra with it, which I was fine with, but for someone else you would probably want to get nudies or something."
"date","I wore this out on a date with my husband in Buenos Aires.","This dress was super fun, comfortable and gorgeous on.","Sadly, I did not take any photos but I will absolutely be renting this again.","This is great for a night out, date, wedding, or when you just want to put on a nice dress and walk around your house :)"
"date","I accidentally put it on without my right arm in the sleeve and had the sleeve tucked into my pants.","Once my friend pointed it out, we laughed and then when I put it on the right way, we realized it was better the first time around!","The pattern is so busy no one would notice and honestly- what a great look!"
"date","Super comfortable.","Fit like a glove.","The colors were true and great for the 4th of July.","The material is thick but I wasnt hot running around to dinner and out afterward."
"date","This dress is a real winner!","Since it is solid white...you can dress it up or down.","You can create so many different looks by accessorizing.","Also, the white looks great with a tan."
"date","I absolutely loved this dress!","Wore it to dinner and a Broadway play for my birthday.","Its very simple, yet elegant.","The dress is super comfortable, and the material is  thick, and very soft.","True to size, and is a shift dress, so its roomy."
"date","It wasnt very forgiving in the tummy area, and was a little snug."
"date","This dress was the perfect combination of sexy, edge and elegance combined with comfort.","The material is a little heavy (warm to be outdoors but perfect for an air conditioned location).","My date LOVED it especially the zippers since he had to help me get in and out of it (the top is tricky).","The color combo had me worried but it looked great and loved the sneaks of skin at the side and in the back.","I would wear this again for sure.","I felt amazing in it."
"date","I was so happy with this dress for Valentines Day!","It is pink, but almost on the redder side.","it was a perfect length (above the knee but not mini) and a perfect fit.","It was flattering and slimming, but not so tight that I felt like I couldnt eat.","I ended up buying a sticky bra to wear with it, but just because my normal bras all have pretty thick sides.","If you have thinner bras, you could probably wear a normal one or, if you dont need a bra, youll need petals to help with the nipplege :) My husband loved it, and I received numerous other compliments.","I was actually sad we only had time for dinner, because I would have been happy to spend a few more hours in it.","I will definitely rent again!"
"date","I absolutely loved this dress!","I wore it for a night out with my hubby in Nashville and I received soooo many compliments!","The only bummer was that it was a cold, rainy night, making it necessary to bundle up with a jacket and scarf, so I didnt get a great photo.","I usually wear a size 2-4, depending up designer, but have found Halston Heritage to run small before, so I ordered a size 6.","It fit OK, but I really could have gone with a size 4.","I will absolutely rent this again."
"date","Form fitting, easy to move around in, cute flirty skirt length."
"date","Material and fit were great.","Really liked the length of the shorts as some rompers feel too short or too flowy that they dont cover much.","Agree with other comments regarding the opening in the front as well as the number of buttons for getting the romper on and off.","One look I tried was actually turning the romper around the have the opening and buttons on the back side and then pairing it with a chunky necklace in the front - just an option if you dont want to wear a camisole, etc."
"date","nice material but not much material in the waist so not as flattering as it could be"
"date","The fit is true to size.","It does not have any zippers so it does have a stretch in the fabric.","The color is BOLD.","You will definitely stand out wearing this.","Also, the sheer cutouts are perfect for the right amount of classy meets sexy.","It is a thicker fabric than a sundress but it is very breathable.","I am also 53 and wore the 46, it fell right above my knees."
"date","I needed a striking dress for a serious business-related date, but also something elegant and classy.","This really accomplished all of that.","The neckline is very feminine without being too revealing.","And the slit in the bottom of the narrow skirt made it easy to walk in.","A great pair of heels, clutch, and simple pearl drop earrings was all that was needed.","I would love to this travel with!","It doesnt wrinkle, folds up small, isnt heavy, and stops traffic in the streets!"
"date","I wore this dress on a date to celebrate my birthday.","We went wine tasting at several wineries and the dress was perfect for the occasion!","Beautiful colors and pattern.","The fit was a little large on top as previous reviews stated.","I would have worn the extra small but the length was too short- It probably would have been better to order the extra small long.","The small regular was long enough but it was a little big on top and I needed to keep adjusting the straps.","I loved wearing this dress!","It was beautiful and I look forward to renting more dresses!"
"date","Easy, stylish and fun.","Great fabric, did not wrinkle, it is lined."
"date","Beautiful on the model in the photo, but not flattering on me.","As other reviews mention, it doesnt drape like the photo and is VERY clingy around the butt and mid section.","Maybe I should have ordered a large?","I also thought the colors were a bit muted.","Not a very special dress.","I struck out with this one."
"date","Wore this dress for Valentines Day.... Night out to a modern Italian-French fusion restaurant in Culver City = lots and lots of delicious food and wine.","I needed a dress that was comfortable, forgiving, and adorable, and this DVF creation is all of that and more.","Adorable, soft, flattering.","Would definitely order again!","!"
"date","I rented the M and L and I choose to wear the L because I felt the length was better.","I have a little bit of hips and butt so the M was a little too short for my taste.","I felt very pretty in it.","On the hanger my husband hated it but when he saw me in it he loved it.","Great dress would definitely rent again."
"date","I loved this jumper.","It fit like a glove and was true to size.","I wish it came with a belt; it has loops, so it looks like it is supposed to be worn with a belt.","Its super sleek and an easy look to put together.","Accent it with an interesting bag or pair of shoes and a necklace and you can wear it anywhere."
"date","The only con is if youre wearing it to dinner, be careful of not to get the sleeves in your food!"
"date","Since it was my birthday month, I rented this dress as my free birthday dress for my 18th birthday dinner.","It was beautiful and even had pockets!","It was a tad larger than I would have hoped but overall I loved it."
"date","Dress fit perfectly.","It showed off my curves, my waist, my legs.","The cut is super sexy and my husband couldnt stop staring at and touching me.","I felt so sexy!","The dress is super comfortable and not at all vulgar.","Several people approached us in the restaurant to comment how beautiful we looked :)"
"date","Fun dress.","Great color, not too short.","I loved the detailing on the waist and the waist was well fitted, slimming, and wide enough to lay flat.","Also, it actually hits at the waist.","A-line, so pockets didnt change the silhouette at all and just added to the fun.","Con: It is extremely deep and does not lay flat over the bust.","Im a 32D, the back size would not change the ability of the dress to lie flat - I think maybe a B cup or below would be okay!","Still, since I was wearing a camisole underneath, I was okay with the puckering of the top - but its not a perfect look!"
"date","This is a classic style thats perfect for a date night!","This dress runs small so I recommend sizing up for your backup size.","I recommend wearing with a Nu-Bra."
"date","I LOVED this dress!","I reeeeeeeallly didnt want to give it back!","This dress is very flattering and and sexy.","I ordered an 8 and a 10 but wore the 8.","It fit perfectly but I think I will size down next time as it did end up looser than I would have liked."
"date","I wish, wish, wish this would have  worked as it was really cute, but the small was HUGE on me and even if I tried to belt it there was just too much excess fabric to make it work."
"date","Bold Red, beautiful.","Wrinkles easily so beware!","And kinda long, but Im short anyways."
"date","I loved wearing this top!","I would have bought it had there not been a stain on the sleeve when I received it.","Fun for a date.","Id say the body of the shirt cut in closer than on the model which made for a better effect."
"date","This is a very forgiving dress - the fabric has a lot of stretch.","The rouching on the side smoothed the look.","Neckline is a little low cut, but stayed in place over dinner.","Very sexy look."
"date","Loved this dress.","Really thick which made it perfect for a fall night dinner.","It was a little short on me but black pantyhose and I felt fine with that.","I didnt have problems with it riding up (other than when sitting) but was fine walking through town.","I would recommend this dress for any event and would rent again!"
"date","Color was amazing and the length fell on the perfect spot on my leg.","The material was of great quality and I received tons of compliments."
"date","As always, trina turk makes a fabulous jumpsuit.","This jumpsuit was quite flattering, even at a dinner where I ate quite a bit.","Fun alternative to a typical LBD."
"date","The dress is beautiful and loved the cut outs!","It was a little tight around my bust/ribcage but once I loosened the straps it helped.","Would definitely rent this dress again!"
"date","I think this is a lovely and very versatile dress.","It flattered my figure and would definitely stand out in a crowd.","Im not always inclined to wear yellow (its an intimidating color to pull off) but this is great sunny shade.","I think the hydgrangea print softens the effect too."
"date","This dress was a cross between sexy and flirty and cute!","It was adorable and the back was HOT...however; Im almost 57 so it was a bit short.","Second RTR rental and it was a homerun!"
"date","This is an awesome top!","The color is vibrant.","The cut is very perfect, billows where you want it to, covers just enough of your back side and shows your shoulders for a bit of sexiness.","Very comfortable for an off the shoulder top.","It stays put but has stretch to it.","The one downside is the fabric does wrinkle easily, even being steamed.","But overall very stunning on."
"date","The silky material was perfect since its a little hot in Hollywood this time of year.","Wore this out to dinner and then to the Pantages to see Book of Mormon.","I felt elegant & flirty.","It was the perfect mix between formal and appropriate at a more casual restaurant.","The print is really pretty in person!","I would say it runs a little large, I am usually a size 4/6 and could have gotten away with the XS."
"date","I loved it!","It fit perfectly and everybody said how much they loved it.","The sleeves are a bit above the elbow and its tea-length.","Lovely dress!","Love FP"
"date","Nice fit.","Different than anything out there.","However, it is peach, not pink/blush."
"date","I typically wear a 0 and went with the 2.","I would have even tried a 4 in this dress.","Great for a party with lots of standing."
"date","I was looking for something sexy and sophisticated for a date night out.","At the time of rental, this dress did not have any reviews or photos, but I decided to take a chance anyway since I loved the color and the neck line.","Based on other reviews for this designer, I anticipated it would run smaller and I was right.","I ordered a 6 & 8 and wore the 6.","It fit perfectly, form fitting without being too constricting--Im sure I would have been uncomfortable if I had gone with a 4.","The material is very thick and well lined, wonderful for the figure, but so not sure how this would do on a really hot afternoon.","Neck line was gorgeous and I think this would work really well for someone with a bigger bust size.","I had to wear a strapless bra with a bit of padding to fill it out.","I was surprised a bit at the hemline, it was a touch longer on me (just below knee) than I thought it would be.","Overall, I think this would be perfect for any number of occasions (wedding, bridal shower, rehearsal dinner, even to church, LOL).","And of course, if you want to show off your shoulders, this is the dress to do it in!"
"date","Loved this dress.","It fit well - appropriate length, not too baggy looking.","I will rent this dress again."
"date","This jumper looks even better in person than the photo.","There are seams at the bust line that give it some nice detailing and structure.","The pants are drapey without being too baggy so its flattering and comfortable.","Im tall (511) and the length was fine.","i wore  a shoe with an ankle strap."
"date","Loved it - the top was made of a soft material that felt amazing when worn.","It was comfy and not too tight even after a eating dinner it didnt feel uncomfortable.","The top has an interesting design but is versatile in that it can be paired with a number of different color combinations."
"date","Wore this to an outdoor concert.","Comfortable and perfect for warm weather.","Had to keep pulling the sleeves down though.","I should have gotten the medium."
"date","Despite being listed in the category for Full Bust, there is not ample room for an actual full bust.","I usually wear size 6, and the dress fit me at the waist and hips, but barely zipped over my chest, even without a bra.","I am a size 38E.","There is no stretch, either.","Otherwise, the dress is lovely, with an elegant pattern that isnt too showy.","It hit me right at the knee."
"date","it was a bit tight but loved the flow"
"date","fits like a glove.","sexy and classy comfortable."
"date","I ordered this as a back up for a 3 year anniversary dinner in Chicago.","When I tried it on I thought overall the fit was okay, but for some reason the sleeves were super long!","I have never had this problem before so I imagine it is the dress, not me.","When I say super long, I mean the sleeves went passed my finger tips.","Something to consider for anyone thinking about renting this, because there was no way I could wear this!"
"date","I didnt love this one, and had it not been that I had it delivered to me while out of town and without a back-up outfit, Im not sure I would have worn it.","I typically wear a 2, but because of the other reviews saying it ran small, I ordered a 4 and a 6.","I wore this with nude peep-toe heels and green dangly earrings.","The 4 fit pretty well.","Cons: The shorts pockets and style were a bit blousey, so I felt like it made my bottom half look larger (not the look I was going for).","From other reviews I thought the shorts would be shorter...maybe its my height, but they felt a bit long.","I know its a romper, which are hard to take off when going to the restroom, but this one was especially hard with the zipper and the hook in the back.","I had to ask other women in the bathroom to hook it for me.","Pros: The color was great - navy, but not so dark the navy looks black.","It was really comfortable and unique."
"date","The 4L fit me perfectly, even though I can have a bit of a booty so I was worried about fit there.","I recommend this for tall people, because the silhoette could be different to pull off in white if you are on the shorter side, and the leg length seemed suited for height.","I wore this to dinner with my bf, and actually went to the bathroom and took off my bra mid-dinner because it became too tight on the chest when I was sitting (even though it fit great with a normal strapless bra when I was standing).","It had plenty of support sans bra, though."
"date","Shows off  your body with class."
"date","little big but very cute"
"date","Loved the fun print on this dress (and the pockets) but I really should have returned it for another size.","the top felt like it ran very large and the straps ended up being about 1.5 inches too long on me.","I will say, its more beautiful in person.","The fabric has some sparkle, and the waist band is crystals.","I would rent again, and for sure size down on this one."
"date","This dress had caught my eye for a while and I finally got it in my size.","Its a fun, trendy dress that I was able to wear a few times, mostly for dinner dates.","I paired the simple, but on trend dress with some espadrilles one time and with heels another.","The dress does have slits on the side which did make it feel a bit short for me at 5 11."
"date","The quality of the material doesnt seem to be holding-up to multiple dry-cleanings.","It looked a bit worn and faded as a result.","Otherwise, its a cute, conservative cut and fun pattern.","I wore it to go to dinner and cha-cha dancing!"
"date","Love this fun dress for the fall!","The simple floral print makes it super wearable even if you dont normally wear print.","The material is amazing quality and stretches to hug your body in all the right places.","I would recommend you to size up if you are curvier in the hips and this should be worn with a strapless bra!","At 56, it comes up to about tea length for me which makes this the perfect dress for this upcoming season.","Cant wait to style this with some black heels for my next date!"
"date","Fit perfectly everywhere except the bust area.","The front gaped and showed my regular bra, so I chose to wear a black bandeau bra underneath that peaked out the top and kept it modest.","I have a little poochy baby belly, so I chose to wear shape wear as well.","In the winter I usually wear tights with DVF dresses, and that does the trick too."
"date","I wish I had a photo.","I actually didnt end up wearing this, due to lack of time on a busy vacation schedule.","But I did try it on, and I loved it.","I could even go bra-less, which is rare for my bra size."
"date","Its a slip dress so every little thing shows, you have to be comfortable w that.","Its a beautiful color - almost dark blue.","It pretty much looks just like the model on.","No bra can be worn w this.","I wish I had taken a picture."
"date","First and foremost, this dress requires a slip!","The bottom in so shear that nothing is left to the imagination.","Other than that the dress is amazing and has beautiful draping."
"date","Wore this for my birthday dinner.","Fit like a glove, but the waistband was a little tight.","Not too tight that it was uncomfortable, though.","Just sexy enough that my boyfriend loved it, but appropriate enough to wear to a nice restaurant with the parents."
"date","This is the perfect shirt for date night or drinks with the girls.","I loved the color and material.","It fell on my shoulders in a really gorgeous way that was flattering.","Looks great with skinnies and heels!"
"date","This dress really held everything in place but was really short.","The fabric doesnt feel that nice on the outside but you cant tell that from the look."
"date","I really like the style of the dress, but the fit wasnt great on me.","It nips in at the waist and Im pretty straight down w/o a pronounced waist so it was tighter in the waist than I would have liked.","I typically wear a 2, but got 4 as backup size.","I really couldnt tell a difference in the two sizes but ended up wearing the 4 hoping it would give me a little more room!","Also, if youve got a full bust, you probably wont be able to wear a bra... and if you do, definitely wear black.","On the right body type I think this dress would be amazing!"
"date","Gorgeous color and texture.","Quality fabric.","A bit short for my 510 frame but sometimes its ok to show off a little leg!"
"date","Great snug fit, however it rode up while I was walking.","I chose the smaller size out of the two I was sent, so maybe if I sized up that wouldnt have happened.","Felt like a million bucks in this."
"date","This is a looser fit than the other Nicole Miller dresses Ive worn, which was a plus.","As other reviewers said, it does seem to bunch up in the back and the slip underneath was a bit tight around my things which made it ride up as I walked."
"date","I wore this dress for my anniversary and it was great!","I originally got it because it looked like the same cut as Slate & Willows very similar dress the Madeline Sheath.","For others who think the same thing, the Madeline Sheath dress is a better dress due to the material.","This dress isnt the same material, the material is instead more of a tight body fitting spandex rayon material that hugs your body.","It wasnt too unflattering because of the pattern on the dress and didnt call too much attention to spots you dont want people noticing.","The drop open back is still stunning and a show stopper, however because I have wide hips and because of the material, the bottom kept riding up.","If have to constantly pull it down when walking to and from places.","Still had a great time wearing the dress though.","The pattern is amazing and the back is gorgeous."
"date","This dress is a beautiful plum/wine color and I wore it with gold earrings, a gold and black necklace, champagne-colored shoes, and a champagne-colored clutch.","I got sizes 4 and 6 and I thought the size 4 fit me slightly better than the size 6.","I am short and the hem of the lace portion of the dress hit me about an inch or two below my knee.","The dress is fairly low-cut.","The dress fit like a glove but not in a constricting, uncomfortable way at all.","I did not notice any areas where the dress felt too tight or too loose, and I was able to move comfortably in it.","I felt beautiful while wearing it and I hated to take it off.","I wish I could buy this gorgeous dress!"
"date","It fits great, stays in place.","The skirt is so full and flowy; its awesome!"
"date","Really pretty dress!","It fit like a glove and because of the print- it was very forgiving.","I have no complaints about the dress itself.","It stayed put all evening- didnt ride up.","One thing to remember/ consider... sequins snag hair.","An up-do may work a little better.","Also in these pictures I am at 200 lbs and the XL worked just fine.","It is a heavy stretchy material.","Order- you wont regret!"
"date","It is low-cut, but I just wore a bright bra, and it peeked out barely."
"date","This skirt is a lot of fun.","I thought the skirt ran an itty bit tight but there is some elastic give.","It is meant to be worn high on the waist.","I was going to wear it to an Anniversary dinner date with my boyfriend but it got Xd by him.","Im short with a ~30 inseam and the skirt was more mid-leg to high ankle length on me.","I dressed it down with a slinky rocker type tank top, leopard print heels, and a black leather jacket.","With the leather jacket on this looked amazing.","My boyfriend thought it was more fitting to wear to a concert type date.","Which is probably true, but I felt amazing in it."
"date","Although this jumpsuit fit and looked really nice on me, I didnt end up wearing it.","The zipper was really tight and a little difficult to zip up (especially as it passed over the waistband).","I was a little nervous about wearing it for an evening out, wondering how I would deal with a trip to the Ladys room.","So I opted for an easier outfit and Ill be returning this jumpsuit.","I would wear it again if I was going to be with a group, and figured I could have someone to accompany me to the Ladys room and help zip/unzip."
"date","little tight on the bust but not unbreathable"
"date","I had to wear the M because I couldnt get my butt and boobs in the small.","The M was perfect!","I had a little belly from eating out that week, but the dress made your body look amazing!","I would buy this dress when I am able to."
"date","Shirt was a great material that accommodated a large chest very well!","I am sitting down in this picture with the sleeves slightly raised, but other than that, it’s a good representation!"
"date","I dont typically wear jumpers but I wanted to try something new and this one fit like a glove!","It is very comfortable, sleek, and sexy.","I loved how it was form fitting and the stretchy fabric is forgiving."
"date","I regret not getting a picture of me in this.","Im 52 and weigh approximately 130.","Usually I wear a size 6.","The 44R fit perfectly.","Because Im short I had to wear these with 3 1/2 inch pumps (red, yay!","), which just made me feel even taller.","I wore this on a date and this made me feel so comfortable and confident.","I never ever pictured myself in a jumpsuit but Im so glad I took a change on this.","I wish I could have kept it."
"date","If you want this dress to be fitted and slimming, I would order a size smaller than what you typically wear.","Im usually a 4, but ended up wearing the 2 because the fit was smoother."
"date","I rented this dress for a date night and really enjoyed wearing it.","It is a bright color blue and was very comfortable to wear.","It was very baggy on the top which is why I gave it three stars.","I probably could have gone down another size.","Overall, I would recommend this dress if you are looking for something fun to wear, but I would size down for your backup dress."
"date","This dress is simple and elegant.","Fit is very flattering and the color is stunning!"
"date","The waist fit nicely, but the top was huge!"
"date","Fantastic dress!","Wish I could keep it!"
"date","Fit absolutely perfect!","I will say it was a little low on me, but I simply wore a sticky bra and it worked out :) I am a size 0-4 / XS-M which is difficult as Im tall and narrow, but have thicker thighs, but I got the Small and it fit like a glove!","I wore it for our Valentines dinner to a nice Italian place and received TONS of compliments.","Warm enough for winter, but sexy enough for date night :) I wanted to keep this dress FOREVER!"
"date","This is a really cute outfit.","I liked the fit and fabric, but I really didnt like the pleats in the front.","If you have a very flat stomach, it is fine, but for someone that had a bit of a tummy, watch out."
"date","This dress is absolutely beautiful and I feel pictures dont fully do it justice.","I was extremely pleased with my first dress rental.","The lace and color is stunning.","This dress is perfect for any occasion.","I did say it runs slightly large, but that could also be my body frame.","This dress is also very comfortable.","This dress would look even cuter, with a pretty belt to accentuate the waist.","Just be cautious not to snag the lace!","Should you decide to make this your special dress for a special event, I believe you will be extremely pleased!","How can I purchase??","?"
"date","Rented this dress for a fancy birthday dinner and was impressed by the level of detail that was put into the print!","Such a unique looking dress.","Im a dramatic hourglass (36-27-35) and both the small and medium fit just fine.","I went with the medium to prepare for eating food though!",":) Unfortunately, Im very short (52) so this dress went incredibly long on me.","I would have liked it above the knee (probably 6-8 shorter)."
"date","I didnt end up wearing it as it was just too short.","I could have worn it with tights and a bootie but I just wasnt feeling it that day."
"date","This dress is sexy!","It gave the illusion that I have a waist when in reality I often feel like my whole core area is a large box shape.","You wouldnt know it in this dress!","But definitely do size up.","I read the reviews about sizing up and I ordered and 8 and a 10 with 10 being the largest that Ive ever worn.","Big Mistake!","If I had worn the 10 I wouldnt have been able to take a normal stride.","I had them overnight the 12 and it fit great.","Im 55, #142 and a 34D.","Once the sizing issue was cleared up I really enjoyed wearing the dress.","I was able to wear a strapless bra with it and the material is thick so it hides booty lumps/bumps :)"
"date","Fit my 38 DD and was very sexy"
"date","Just like the picture -- very feminine and fluttery with lovely fabric.","Very well made.","I wore it to a less formal dinner and added a jeans jacket which covered my chest a bit and gave the entire look a luxe boho chic vibe.","I normally wear size 10P and since this was fitted with no give I went with the XL just in case.","It was very comfortable.","Im about 52  (I just dream Im 53) and the length hit me just above the knees.","The scalloped chiffon hemline looked wonderful--not too long, but clearly not as short as it looks on the model.","Highly recommend."
"date","Great dress that hugs every curve.","The fabric stretches and covers flaws and pantylines,  so I felt comfortable all night.","The back is low so wore pasties and it was perfect.","It rode up a little as I walked, but I chalk that up to having a full backside ;) The blue sequins were just enough sparkle without being over-the-top disco ball."
"date","I would say it fit like a glove except for the length of the legs.","Wearing 5 platforms helped.","Having zippers on the size of the legs also helped (unzipping them a little made it look more flow-y)."
"date","The loose/drape fit is a bit outside of my comfort zone, as I think someone of my build can easily get eaten up in all the fabric.","The Keepsake defies all odds and leaves the wearer feeling comfortable and sexy with its open back and focused neckline.","Nice, thick material so it was nice for a winter evening.","The bow is just the right touch!","The color is a bit more burnt red than expected.","Definitely can only wear a strapless bra or pasties.","Wish I owned it!"
"date","This fit large so a 2R fit great.","Still roomy but fit in the chest.","Belted helps too."
"date","I didnt end up wearing it."
"date","This is a beautiful dress in a rich color.","I normally wear a 10 in real clothes, but a 12 in RTR dresses.","I rented the 12 & 14 as a backup.","The 14 gave me better length (but the 12 wasnt too short by any means) and more room in my hips, but the open back was gaping.","I ended up wearing the 12 & investing in spanx.","I felt pretty in this dress, but it wasnt a knockout.","I would recommend for women who are apple shaped, not pear.","There seems to be way more room in the bust than the hips"
"date","I rented this for a classy dinner date.","The fabric was really nice and sturdy and the silk tie detail around the waist was great for keeping my hourglass figure.","The plunge is quite deep, Im a 34C, so I went without a bra and it didnt look too booby or risque.","I would definitely rent this again!"
"date","Very flattering."
"date","So in love with this dress, will definitely rent it again.","Falls nicely and perfect length.","Obsessed."
"date","This is such a beautiful dress!","It just was a bit too small for me.","I ordered my typical size, so Id just suggest going up a size or two."
"date","This dress definitely runs small in the arms.","I usually wear a size 2 but had to wear the 4 which ended up being loose everywhere else.","Which is why I belted it.","Cute color."
"date","My husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary by having dinner at our wedding venue.","Since our wedding was themed was a vintage theme with black lace accents, this was the perfect dress.","I ordered the 10 and the 12, and the 10 would have been a perfect fit but the zipper wasnt the best and kept getting stuck, so I upped it to the 12 which was a loose on top, but still worked.","Would definitely rent this one again."
"date","Fabric is stretchy, and it was a good snug fit across the top."
"date","I loved this little romper - I wore it 3 weekends in a row with different friend groups and got so many compliments.","Im pear shaped and the large fit me well, I am glad I went with large not medium.","It was a bit tedious to use the restroom but it was worth it.","I have small chest so it worked since you cant wear a bra but my larger busted friends told me they could never wear something like this.","The fabric is very nice, I highly recommend!"
"date","This dress is very well made and the red color is great - very vibrant.","The slit is quite high, so beware if thats not what youre looking for.","Im pear shaped but ended up sizing down to a 6 b/c the stomach area was way too loose in an 8, but overall I was very happy with this rental!"
"date","I didnt end up going with this dress , because there was only a size 2 available and I needed a size 4 for a comfortable for, but overall the dress was simply gorgeous.","Nice thick material so it hung great ,very flattering and had good stretch.","The only con was, and this is just a style choice , but I thought the neckline was too high and would have preferred a more open neckline.","But I would definitely rent this dress in a size 4 for a dinner date ."
"date","A great sexy dress thats comfy too.","I liked that I could wear a normal black bra with it.","Overall liked it, but long torso girls beware: Though the skirt is long, I have a long torso therefore the skirt slit hits scandalously high...I wore shorty shorts under it so that anyone getting a glimpse only saw what looked like bloomers...and they definitely showed.","Had I not been going to a ballroom dance studio event where skimpy dresses are part of the costume, I wouldnt have been comfortable wearing it out.","If I had longer legs (versus the torso!)","it would be a 5-star.",":-)"
"date","Loved this dress!","It is definitely tight/form-fitting but very forgiving.","I went with the small (vs XS) to be a little more comfy for birthday dinner.","Received tons of compliments!"
"date","So great"
"date","Easy, versatile piece, perfect for a cooler summer night."
"date","Size MR fit me perfectly, but larger busts may want to size up because the top portion of the dress was already pretty snug on me.","This dress is very flattering; although the print is bold, the shape is conservative but still interesting.","The length is great, especially with high heels or platforms (as pictured)."
"date","This dress is gorgeous.","I wore it for my birthday dinner and received tons of compliments.","I was lucky to get a new one with a tag.","I am 57 and normally wear a 6, sometimes a 4 and the 6 fit perfect.","The print is lovely and it is a truly flattering fit.","The bust area fit fine and the length is perfect.","I would definitely rent this, it is sexy and fun!"
"date","I ordered a size 10, and it fit very well.","The colors of the dress rocked, the fit up top, around the hips, and the length were all on point.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"date","The dress was really cute and summery.","I got this for my birthday dress to wear on a date.","It was fun, but the fabric doesnt have any give and was pretty tight in the chest.","I usually wear a size 8, but had to go up to the 10 for the bust.","Do be careful - the skirt slit sometimes gets a little risky with the opening."
"date","I wore this for Valentines Day dinner and had strangers all over the restaurant stopping me to compliment me on the dress.","I think this is the most compliments Ive received with an RTR dress!","The color and lace is really beautiful, and the open back is a great detail.","(Of note, the open back starts high enough that I could still wear Spanx under the dress.)","Its probably a little too long for us short girls (Im 53 and it hid mid-calf or just below) but it still worked with heels.","Highly recommend."
"date","This dress was fun, and comfy - runs a bit large!"
"date","I love this dress so much, I want to own it!","I wore it to celebrate my birthday and it totally added something special to my day.","If you already have an hourglass figure, then your body will feel at home in this little number.","But if you are anything but hourglass, this dress is cut in such a way that you will appear hourglass.","For me, it required a little fashion tape at the cleavage, but otherwise, its the perfect dress to be the center of attention."
"date","I went for a normal size for me / slightly up and unfortunately it was too large.","Still a very cute cut and color."
"date","Jumper runs really large.","I am between 8 and 10, leaning in most cases to size 10.","I tried on the 8 and there was still room esp.","stomach area.","It did not look bad, so I will be wearing it.","But I think if I had enough time to re-order, I wouldve rented a size 6.","Otherwise great color and nice relaxing feel."
"date","Because I am so short the hem seemed an awkward length in the front; not quite tea length but still below the knee.","This dress would better suit a taller person.","The color was fantastic and fun.","The neckline does nothing for your chest but the bodice and overall craftsmanship I would give an A+.","It was fun to wear the one time but I would not rent it again."
"date","Fit runs large, skirt might be short on some, but perfect on my 5 foot frame.","Fine to go braless, covered in tiny sequins.","Sexy, elegant and well made.","Great to hide a tummy.","Awesome dress!"
"date","Cute... However- its difficult to put and off if youre alone.","#singlegirlprobs"
"date","This dress feels awesome on!","It hugs in all the right places, and red is such a stunning color, you will be the center of attention!"
"date","The material is very heavy and good quality.","The neck is a little tight, but not the worst.","I loved the silhouette it made!","My boyfriend said it was his favorite dress Id rented so far."
"date","This dress was perfect for the Britney concert in Vegas!","I went to the Cosmopolitan store and the whole process was awesome.","Fit was great and I loved the pockets."
"date","Unfortunately, I couldnt zip the dress up.","Im traditionally a size 4 and should of ordered a size 6.","Its still a beautiful dress"
"date","I rented this dress for a beach vacation and it was perfect to go to dinner/drinks.","It sizes large, so I would probably down size next time to XS (I am a size 6).","The decollete is very deep.","I wore with a bikini top because I didnt want to flash anyone, and because beach vacation.","I dont really envision this dress in a formal setting, because of the fabric (light and airy) and because it doesnt hold in place well (will need a lot of fashion tape and no bra)."
"date","This dress was perfect for our elegant 25th anniversary dinner.","First, RTR is the way to go if you need a nice dress or two while on vacation - they dont take up any room in the suitcase (just dont forget your shoes, like I did) This specific dress was the perfect fit - snug but not too tight on the top (hubby had to zip me in but I could still breathe) plus just the right amount of cleavage.","The lower half is flowing so comfortable to sit, eat, and still look great.","Ill get this one if its available for sale later."
"date","I wore this to work then happy hour and date night for my birthday.","It was a hot and humid day, and the light material was perfect for the weather without being too flimsy.","The top is totally work appropriate (especially if youre not particularly large chested like me), but the slit makes it a little risqué, especially if you cross your legs, so be warned if you sit next to anyone.","For me, it was a fun way to transition from day to night.","Theres no zipper, but I had no problem getting it on overhead (though off was slightly trickier).","I was comfortable all day."
"date","This dress had a thicker fabric, but you could still get away with wearing it in the summer.","It was perfect for my date and had room so I could eat a big dinner!"
"date","This jacket runs very small, even though I ordered a size large it still didnt fit across my chest when I tried to zip it up.","Not for women with full busts!"
"date","I think it fit like a glove.","I ordered the top in medium because I have a bigger bust and couldnt have been happier with the fit!","I paired it with nude strappy heels and a military style jacket to make it more edgy.","Loved it!"
"date","A fabulous, well-constructed dress that was very flattering.","This dress has no stretch, but the tailoring is so great there were no fit issues.","This is shocking considering how tall I am and it still worked for me.","I am nearly 60, so as you can see this dress is very short on me.","Boyfriend loved it though, the shortness kept it on the sexy side and was a great balance to the conservative neckline and thick fabric.","Loved it!"
"date","Looked Lovely!","Felt Comfortable, and the fit was spot on.","Had some zipper issues, and the lace on the hem was curling and needed pressing.","Slight pilling but only visible to me.","I felt like all eyes were on my for our date night!"
"date","Comfortable, light, flattering."
"date","Absolutely in love with this dress!","I wish I could have purchased it.","Went to a concert and danced all night.","The full skirt is great for dancing and is very feminine.","It runs small in the waist - the size 0 fit like a 00."
"date","Loved this dress because it was bright and cheerful.","Im tall, but it wasnt too short"
"date","This dress was pretty, and the top fit well but I felt it was a bit short so may not be the best for those 5 10 or taller.","If it didnt have the elastic at the waist then the length would have been fine but because of that if caused it to ride up a bit higher."
"date","Rented this for a dinner date night & Received compliment from strangers also!"
"date","This top was so cute and unique!","Im not typically a big fan of crop tops, but this one was just so pretty!","I am wearing it with a nude cami because thats all I had on hand, but Id recommend wearing it with a black cami underneath.","It is see-through, so youll need something under there!","I like this top with jeans or black pants, and heels or flats.","It does run really small though, so I went for the XL.","Id recommend sizing up if youre unsure."
"date","Very nice material, especially for the colder months.","Hugs you in the right places!","Would rent again."
"date","The dress is gorgeous!","It runs a bit small and the v in the front is quite low.","The model in the photo is flat chested, so I wasnt sure how it would look on me.","I felt va-va voom and my husband loved it...haha!","I will rent a dress from the same designer for NYE."
"date","Loved everything about it."
"date","I rented both this dress and the Halston Heritage blue jumpsuit for a date.","Although the fabric and color for this dress were beautiful, when I tried it on I thought I looked much older in a not super flattering way.","I think this dress would also work best for someone a few inches taller than me.","Also there are zippers on the sleeves at the wrists (detail I didnt see from viewing the dress on the website)."
"date","I love this top!","It is classy, but also edgy and fashion forward.","I wore it three times in a week - on a date, and to two parties, each time with leggings as Im typically a dress/skirt person, and this item only works with pants.","I like my tops to be fitted around the bust so wore a medium, but would describe the top as true to size."
"date","I loved this shirt!","I received so many compliments.","It was a great fit and I would definitely rent again!"
"date","Im 12 weeks pregnant so was hoping the waist was stretchy and it is not, but still worked well for a nice date night.","Id recommend."
"date","I rented this for Christmas date but did not wear it after all, as the color was too dark for my complexion.","I loved the unique shape and the length, it would have been perfect to pair with slim pants, or skinny jeans if you dress it down."
"date","Because it is a leather dress, there isnt much give, so I decided to size up to have some wiggle room, especially around my hips.","My fiance and I both loved the dress.","The leather gives it a little edge so it was perfect for date night.","I got lots of compliments at the restaurant as soon as I took my coat off.","I highly recommend this dress."
"date","It is a challenge to zip... and a challenge to get it above breast - also stride is cut in 3/4 the slit isnt long enough"
"date","Its a great dress.","I wore it with black wedge sandals on a date night with my hubby.","I wore a medium.","The small fit a little snug around my shoulders (but my shoulders are muscular).","I love the little cut out in the front.","The material doesnt wrinkle and the length was good for me."
"date","I was nervous to try the cut-out trend, but this dress is very comfortable!","Definitely recommend!"
"date","I loved this Shoshanna dress and almost everything she makes.","I wore this to work with a white cardigan, and to a fancy birthday dinner with a white pashmina.","The lines are beautiful.","So cute."
"date","I wore this with the PINSTRIPE KIMONO TOP and they looked great together.","I bought both"
"date","LOVE this top, want to keep it.","Its so comfortable and chic.","Does run bigger but I love that kind of fit.","Throw it over skinnies and heels and its perfect!"
"date","The lining showed a bit beyond the front bottom hem, and the off-the-shoulder parts were rather tight making it a little uncomfortable (and couldnt move arms) but overall fabulous look"
"date","I wanted to try something outside of my comfort range, but this didnt work for me.","It kept riding up on my shoulders so I didnt get the off-the shoulder look I wanted and the fabric on the left side of the neckline would not stay flat, which made the neckline look uneven.","It didnt look terrible, but this is definitely a statement top and I think I wasnt comfortable standing out that much."
"date","Runs large, I normally wear an 8-10, and I read the reviews so I ordered an 8 and a 6.","I could have worn a 4, but the 6 fit fine, it didnt gape at the armpits or anything, I just feel like a 4 would have been a little more flattering.","The color was beautiful, it was a nice sturdy material.","The neckline was beautiful.","I wish it had pockets."
"date","Has pockets, but is still dressy!"
"date","Rented this one for an anniversary dinner with my husband and it fit great!","I felt like a million bucks and the lace is beautiful.","Only thing is - it rides up a bit when walking, but I still loved it and would recommend."
"date","My plans changed from a night out to a stroll through a botanical garden and the dress still worked.","It was very easy to either dress up or dress down, and I really appreciate that even though my plans changed, my outfit didnt have to change."
"date","Was a perfect dress to travel in, very comfy and still looked great after a 2 hour flight!"
"date","I was sent this dress when a backup order didnt come through at the last minute.","I didnt end up wearing it, as I preferred the other dress, but if I had an event, I definitely wouldve worn this one.","(Great for hiding the hips!)"
"date","It was perfect, I wore it for my 1 year wedding anniversary and it was the perfect dress!","The slits add a little extra something but you dont notice them unless you dance or sit!"
"date","I rented this for a birthday date - my husband took me to see a play.","It was just formal enough that I was comfortable and didnt feel over dressed.","I wore it to work that day (I work in a business casual office) and into the evening for our date.","I was 21 weeks pregnant and didnt have any issues with the fit, as this dress is not form fitting.","I was very comfortable in it.","I was a little hesitant about the color, but was glad in the end.","Would have kept it if I had the chance!","(and the $$) :)"
"date","The dress fit wonderfully!","It was lined, so it kept me very warm on a cool night.","I got the XS and S. The XS was too snug in the hip area, but the S fit perfectly."
"date","The fit was great and its a beautiful dress!","I got a lot of compliment."
"date","I was not a fan of this top.","The elastic in the neckline is all one piece so the top slips up frequently with arm movement.","Color is true to photo, its true to size and the material is nice."
"date","True to size, this dress was very comfortable and the fit was great.","Wore it to the Theatre and got several compliments!","The sleeve ties are a fun detail."
"date","I rented this dress for an anniversary dinner and concert with my husband.","I really liked this dress since it was a perfect LDB for a night out but the back made it unique and a little more fun.","The dress is very comfortable yet flattering.","I would rent this one again."
"date","Absolutely beautiful dress.","The front was a tiny bit low cut, so I couldnt wear a bra without it showing.","The top was supportive though, so it wasnt too much of an issue.","There is no stretch to this material."
"date","Fits true to size.","Underneath slip will ride up.","Oh, well...worth it!"
"date","Honestly, I didnt realize it was a crop top when I ordered it, but it was still cute.","Was a great date top paired with a high waisted black pencil skirt!"
"date","The dress ticks off all of the boxes: sexy, classy, flattering, comfortable, and of course, red!","Perfect for a date or a work party.","You definitely need a little bit of fashion tape for the outer straps, but then youre good to go with a pair of heels and earrings!"
"date","Fortunately I sized up for the extra and even the large was very fitted.","My main issue with rompers is if the waist length is too short, but this was perfect for that.","Pretty open back with nice tie detail!!","Wore this to a Braves game and got many compliments!"
"date","Beautiful dress that I received tons of compliments on.","The material was a little stiff.","Otherwise, perfect."
"date","I LOVED this dress.","The slit is a bit high, but only worrisome when you sit down!"
"date","I ordered the small which was fine but I could have probably done the xs the style of dress it was though it didnt matter so I would say stick to your true size.","I wore this on a date and then to work the following week.","The dress is comfortable and cute.","It arrived I was getting ready for the date.","I just threw it on and went... its that kinda of dress which was nice.","No complaints."
"date","I rented these for a dinner date, but ended up not wearing them because the weather turned warm and I was afraid I would be too hot in these.","But I loved them!","I thought the ponte material on the back side might show lumps and bumps, but it was very smoothing and flattering.","They did run a bit small IMO, as I usually wear a small in stretchy pants like these.","I have a small waist and the size small was just a little too tight in the waist for my liking.","The medium fit better so that is the size I would have worn.","Overall, they were a very comfortable and flattering pant that I would rent again when the weather is cooler."
"date","The fit is true to size, a little low in the front but nothing crazy.","The material is thick and clearly well made, just a gorgeous top overall.","I look forward to wearing this a few nights before returning!"
"date","Im not generally one to wear pink but this dress may have made a convert out of me.","So comfortable and lightweight.","My original plans cancelled so I just wore it out for some drinks.","Got so many compliments!"
"date","The dress was perfect for our evening out.","My husband thought that it accentuated all of my curves."
"date","I loved this dress!","It fit perfectly!","The material was perfect for a summer date/wedding/evening out.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"date","Rented this for a date night out and really wanted to love it!","It was just what I was looking for, something pretty fitted but with some stretch to it.","Thats exactly what I got, but unfortunately, I didnt think it was all that flattering (on me).","The size 4 was very tight through the hips and thigh area.","There was more room with the size 6, but it was in the hip area so when it was on, it kind of puckered there.","I felt like it was too tight across my thighs and felt a little self conscious about it all night.","Length was perfect though and the colors were bright and very pretty.","On other reviewers, its gorgeous--I just dont think this was my favorite dress!"
"date","I rented this dress for a date night out to a nice restaurant and then dancing.","It was the perfect dress for both settings!","I am 57 and the length was perfect, to just above my knee.","This balanced out the cut-outs well.","It was the perfect combination of fun and classy!","The dress was comfortable and gave me plenty of room to both sit and dance.","A strap-less bra worked well.","The color was amazing!","I would highly recommend this dress."
"date","Its a beautiful piece... but it is showing its age with its wear and tear.","The fabric is pulled around the belly button - looks like a snag from previous users.","However its a great sexy combo of being revealing enough while still covering enough to be out and about in any situation!"
"date","This dress fit like a glove in every way.","The backless detail and the lace edging were stunning.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"date","Fit great, did not need to wear a bra."
"date","I had no issue with the fit, Was warned the hips could be a little tight but I did not have any problems.","Very comfy but still looked beautiful.","I wore this dress without a bra and had no issues."
"date","I loved the way this dress fit.","And the cape kept me warm."
"date","This dress is great for a date night or or any formal night!"
"date","Runs true to size.","Wasnt too tight in the arms and shoulders for me.","Was very comfortable.","Not too short for someone my height which is a great."
"date","The leather is thick and heavy, like a motorcycle jacket.","Its warm.","The cut is really cute, but it does run really small.","I would have needed an XL to layer properly."
"date","Wore this for a dinner out with friends.","I was worried initially that the dress would be too stuffy, but the sheer back and lace-edged bust line were fun and flattering.","The fabric is a bit stiff, so size up if youre in between sizes."
"date","Even prettier and more vibrant in person.","Fit perfectly, just the right length and just a peek of midriff, still pretty conservative.","You can easily dress it up or down.","I really loved it and would rent it again!"
"date","I wish I had a better photo, but I loved it as Ive loved them all :)  I have small breasts, so Id recommend sticky tape.","When I was standing it was fine, but when Id sit I had to be careful!","If you are a bitter bigger you should be fine.","Very comfortable, fit nicely, many many compliments.","Used it as our valentines day dinner date down in Naples.","You could dress this up more, I would even wear this to a wedding for sure!"
"date","This dress is quirky and fun.","I love that is has pockets!","The skirt and top overlay create a slimming effect.","My only complaint is that the collar is quite tight."
"date","I fell in love with this LBD.","I wore it for a date night out with my boyfriend and he said I looked super sexy in it.","I thought it was just the right length for a mini dress.","The large fit like a glove, but if I gained 10 pounds I dont think it wouldve looked as good (155 lbs).","The material was not flimsy at all & I was even able to wear it without a bra.","I do not have implants, but am lucky in that respect.","If you have a large bust that needs support be mindful of the lace sides.","It was comfortable in every aspect and I would rent it again in a heartbeat."
"date","The dress fit well, a little narrow at waist but that works well for me.","It wasnt too short, the pockets are a great touch.","Light minty color."
"date","I was a little worried when I ordered because I did so about 3 days before the day I needed it (our 5 year anniversary dinner in Newport) and I am typically either a 4 or a 6, and read that the sleeves were tight.","There were no 6s available for a backup size but I ordered just the 4 anyway to receive the next day, two days before the event.","I got home and ran upstairs to try it on and was SO excited when I zipped it up and it fit perfectly!!","Snug in all the right places.","My boyfriend loved it and I am so pleased with the experience!","Got so many compliments, would definitely recommend."
"date","This is a great dress, wonderful materials and a fun flare at the bottom.","It fit well, but it needs to be dressed up a bit.","Id recommend renting alongside some fun jewelry or high heels to set the tone."
"date","Definitely a must have(or rent) dress for the petite.","It is perfect for a date or formal dinner.","Cant believe it even came with sample shampoo&conditioner duo.","I do appreciate the idea that RTR let us keep the hangers and bags...","Very happy about the first try"
"date","I ordered this dress a size bigger based on the 2 reviews that were available and glad I did, the 4 fit to perfect but no way a 2 would have worked.","I have a 26 waist and this was very fitted so depending on your shape you may need to size up.","The length was great and I wore this with sheer black tights and booties."
"date","It fit like a glove, true to size."
"date","Loved this!","Great FIT :)"
"date","Definitely looks better when you add a belt.","I was 3 months pregnant when I wore this, so I was hoping it would be a bit more stretchy than it actually was.","Overall, it looked good and I was pleased with it."
"date","I am usually a 2/4 and I ordered the 4 because the 2 was unavailable.","The bottom of the dress was really wide and not form fitting at all.","I dont think the 2 would have helped.","Maybe I should have even ordered the 0?"
"date","I LOVED this dress!!!","I felt amazing in it and it was super unique.","I received so many compliments and it was very comfortable.","It does run large and also stretches a bit.","I typically wear an 8 so I ordered an 8 and a 6 for back up and ended up wearing the 6 - hindsight I think a 4 would have fit perfectly.","The bust was a bit loose on me.","I did wear it without a bra but I also have a larger natural bust so you may want to keep that in mind.","Overall I would definitely recommend this dress but definitely size down and plan on wearing something underneath to give the girls a boost!"
"date","This dress is very comfortable but also very fancy.","The pocket showed some wear on the inside at the seam but only if closely examined.","The dress is fancy enough for a dressy wedding guest attire due to the textured lacy embroidery.","Beautiful colors.","Flattering fit."
"date","I originally hadnt ordered this dress - the one I had ordered couldnt be shipped so they sent this instead.","I usually wear a size 2 so when they sent a 4 I was skeptical but the size ended up being perfect on me.","I am 51 so it came slightly above my knee but looked great and was really comfortable."
"date","It was beautiful, lined, well made, perfect, and what else can I say."
"date","Can be worn with or without the straps.","Worn without a bra, as its built in corset holds everything in place."
"date","I really loved how comfortable and cute this was.","The only problem is that I should have gotten a smaller size.","I thought for sure I would need either a 2 or 4, but it turned out 0 was probably the way to go.","I have literally no chest, so that was probably a huge part of it because I spent the night pulling it up trying to hide my strapless bra from being exposed.","It would be great for large chested girls!",":)"
"date","very flattering, on the shorter side, overall flirty"
"date","This dress- like most Elizabeth and James fits a little small but once you find the right size its amazing.","It hugged every curve ( I have few lol) and I got compliments every 5 minutes.","The color is steel blue-ish with a hint of green.","Im contemplating buying it just to own it."
"date","Beautiful!!!","One of my favorite dresses.","Love the color and the lace.","This dress is completely covered in lace, so there is no stretch.","At 5’6”, this came to 3 inches above my knee.","I love the high neck and sleeve designs.","There is also a triangle cutout in the back and four buttons!","We definitely recommend sizing up for this style.","I would wear this on a date or to a wedding.","Pair with 3 inch heels and earrings!"
"date","This dress is nothing short of stunning!!","The color, the fit, the texture,  the peekaboo in the front.","It truly is a show stopper!!","I have triple Ds and did not wear a bra and felt comfortable!","The color is a gorgeous emerald and is super vibrant!","The cap sleeves were perfect!!","The waist had little vivre but ran true to size.","I would size up for the backup."
"date","This dress was perfect!","I had wanted something I would be conformable in to go see a Broadway play with my girlfriends, and this dress was great!","It was very flattering on me, I just had a baby not to long ago and still have the pouch, and this dress made me feel pretty again!","It does run a little on the larger size, I have been in a size 14 post baby and I rented a 10 after reading the reviews and it fit perfect for me, but I dont think you are supposed to really tighten the strings on it, I think the dress is meant to be a little lose.","I would totally rent this again!"
"date","I wore this to take my boyfriend out in the city for dinner.","I almost wish I ordered a size larger as it was SO TIGHT FITTING.","It felt painted on to my body!","It is a sexy, stunning dress and I felt gorgeous in it!","Would rent it again (one size up though!)"
"date","This dress was gorgeous but Im 511 and it didnt hit me quite where I wanted it to.","I think this is a great dress, just didnt wow me."
"everyday","Not at all form-fitting, but this dress is really easy to wear and relaxed, but a nice fabric."
"everyday","this dress has made me love and become interested in the mara hoffman label.","it is beautiful, chic, light weight, and comfy.","it did run large, belting it is recommended.","i live in fl, so i appreciated the airy feel of this loose fitting dress.","i loved the tropical print too :) very sad to return, id love to own it!"
"everyday","."
"everyday","This bomber is a bit large in the shoulders but I loved the jacket anyway.","Its very heavy and warm, so I wouldnt plan on wearing it unless it will be chilly out!"
"everyday","The size small was unavailable, so I went with the medium.","Was definitely way too big in the top, but there is a draw string so I was able to make it work.","Small would have been perfect!"
"everyday","Super cute but the sleeves were somewhat stretched out."
"everyday","Ive noticed some Elizabeth & James pieces are quite true to size and others are almost shockingly small.","This was the latter - I got in on with no real problem, but even being in shape enough to confidently rock a crop top, there was a little too much skin poking out the sides of this for me to be comfortable wearing it publicly.","It needs a little more stretch - would size up.","Im generally between a 4-6, at least in my waist, and the 6 was borderline at best."
"everyday","Really stylish, waterproof coat.","I wore it on a trip to London and really enjoyed it (and was thankful for the integrated hood)!"
"everyday","wore this top to work as well as out on a saturday night.","got tons of compliments.","really pretty colors and on trend with the ruffles and bell sleeves.","there are sheer panels but over the chest is not sheer.","i didnt wear a tank top when i wore it out but did for work."
"everyday","Love the contrasting pattern.","Not usually something I would pick up but great fit and very flattering!"
"everyday","Got a lot of compliments and went with everything.","Very structured and eye-catching."
"everyday","I love this jacket but should have ordered the Medium.","I ordered the Large since a previous leather bomber jacket I ordered in Medium was quite small.","This one was very large, though.","Even with a heavy sweater under it, the waistband was very loose and the overall fit very big.","I suggest going down a size if you want it to fit as a bomber jacket.","The leather is gorgeous though!"
"everyday","As others said it does run large but that works for me because I am very large chested.","Arm holes are large so I wore a cami.","The lace is so pretty and feminine!","I am tempted to keep it!"
"everyday","This was a great top, no complaints, good for petites."
"everyday","This dress is breezy and feminine.","It can be dressed up or down with accessories and footwear.","It was appropriate for work and play.","The draw string can allow you to cinch the waist, which I needed to do as the midsection hung a bit loosely otherwise.","I was worried the neckline might be frumpy but it was lovely.","The only downside for me was that the fabric isnt soft and feels synthetic.","Otherwise, its a piece I would consider buying.","However Id definitely rent it again."
"everyday","I wore a very similar outfit as what the model has—waxed leggings, a tee under the sweater, and heels—and felt comfy but put together all day.","The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because it was much longer on me (down to my knees) and I wish the XS had been a little shorter.","Otherwise, great item!"
"everyday","Light, comfortable and went well with multiple outfits"
"everyday","The fit was perfect"
"everyday","I read the warnings that this dress would be big, but I figured it was just roomy.","No, this dress is huge!","I will rent again in a smaller size because I so badly wanted this to work!","The fabrics and the color are great!"
"everyday","I was excited to wear this dress because of the unique sleeve detail.","Unfortunately, on my body, it made me look bulky on top."
"everyday","I liked this because it was a unique take on the bomber trend.","It is all silk, so it makes it a little precious if there is rain, etc.","But overall, it was comfy and stylish."
"everyday","A little short for taller girls (Im 6 foot) and a little snug through the hips and butt ...so if youre curvy, I would recommend sizing up.","The fabric is thick and doesnt stretch.","I normally wear an 8 for Milly clothing, but I got a 10 and it was still a little snug (but totally wearable.)","...very classic New England summer feel!"
"everyday","I love this dress and want to have it in my closet.","I wore in numerous time when I had it from my unlimited membership.","It is a larger fit so I would definitely go down a size.","It can be difficult to wear a bra with this dress bra but it can definitely be done with the right garments.","I would recommend this a great daytime casual dress, it is comfy and easy to accessorize."
"everyday","This skirt is gorgeous.","It is clearly incredible quality (its Provenza, so it should be!)","I wear between a size 8 and a size 8....","I wouldnt recommend going down a size just because its the only size available.","Pick the larger size you go between.","I didnt need to go up to a 10, but I should have just waited around for the 8 to come back in stock.","Either way, the skirt is stunning and you should rent it."
"everyday","I rented this through my Unlimited subscription; kept for 2 weeks and wore it about 6 or 7 times.","Nice and warm."
"everyday","I thought renting this in a size up would make it longer.","It did not.","The outfit was very cute but my butt cheeks were hanging out.","No even just close to showing, but full on, heres my butt crease.","It is very short.","I am a short person too, so if you have a long torso or are taller, I do not know if this will work well for you.","Very cute though, wish it would have worked."
"everyday","Enough stretch to cover a 5 month baby bump.","Runs long but with heals isnt a problem."
"everyday","I love the collar and the lace detailing of the fabric, however, the dress is a bit tight especially in the bust/ chest area, making it hard to zip up in the back.","Otherwise, this is a nice piece for everyday, though it is a bit short for my work (about 4-5 inches above my knees)."
"everyday","I love this jacket - its definitely a more unusual/statement piece but if you are looking like something that can transform your look multiple days this is perfect for fall.","Its very puffy/bubble shaped as the pictures reflect.","In terms of fit, it is intentionally boxy/oversized for much of the jacket (sleeves are voluminous, the bust area is roomy) but be aware that the waist is actually quite tight and fits at the natural waistline, which could lead you to want to size up especially if you want to wear it zipped a lot (I mostly am wearing it unzipped).","It is also a very short/cropped shape so if you are really tall or want it to fit more like on the model picture, maybe size up for that reason too.","I got a small size and it definitely was more shrunken looking on me than the model, but I was very happy with the look."
"everyday","Love this shirt - super cute with a little added flare"
"everyday","The dress was extremely comfortable  - material was great.","Wore with nude heels for a classic, polished look."
"everyday","True to size, snug fit"
"everyday","Can be worn casual or dressed up.","The print is bright and eye catching.","I may be short, but the dress was very long.","Even with heels it almost touched the ground."
"everyday","Fit: The dress runs a little small and fits tightly.","Pros: Very sexy.","Hugs all the right places.","The layers move beautifully as you move.","The length is perfect for shorter/petite women.","The fabric is beautiful and well made.","Piece looks like a million bucks.","I recommend it.","Cons: Dress is very tight and it took a little work to get into it.","The straps are very narrow and dig into the shoulder a little bit.","The bra coverage is very small and the cut is low.","I eventually added a sheer bra for modesty."
"everyday","I loved this loose shift dress!","Such a great outfit for work and I received tons of compliments.","This definitely needs to be paired with a wedge or heel of some sort, I wore a suede wedged boot- looked awesome!"
"everyday","I loved wearing this top on a great summer day with shorts and flats bopping around with my family on a summer weekend day.","I got compliments and I stayed cool and loved the fun look"
"everyday","Super flattering cut, length, draping, fabric pattern and fabric weight make this an all around A+ dress!!","While Im certainly a petite frame, I do have my problem areas, and this dress did a phenomenal job at masking every single imperfection while still being very figure flattering and completely comfortable (which is a real rarity!!).","While I dressed it down for a casual Sunday brunch, its style is incredibly classic and more versatile than most.","Fit is true to size, not too big nor too small anywhere and was entirely comfortable for more than 8 hours of wear.","If my closet wasnt already busting at the seams, this piece would be a must have!"
"everyday","loved it - a lot of compliments!"
"everyday","Waist runs tight.","Im typically a 4 in skirts and should have ordered a size up.","Beautiful colors and material.","Will order correct size so I can wear it!"
"everyday","A little heavy"
"everyday","Nice material, runs small."
"everyday","I didnt end up wearing this dress, because I needed to send it back to swap it in on something else quickly.","Its very nicely made, very comfortable, and great classic styling.","A terrific spring look.","My only complaint is that it was a little high waisted for me, but thats a pretty regular occurrence in dresses that dont come in a long option.","Highly recommend this one!"
"everyday","I think my hips were a tad big but it was still comfy-nice material and not too short-has a slip in lining very classy"
"everyday","Thick fabric and great cut.","Very slimming.","Chic but not giving away too much skin.","Loved it."
"everyday","I loved this dress and kept it for a long time.","Very very comfortable and perfect for everyday wear (I love in Florida.)","I think I got at least one compliment each day that I wore it."
"everyday","Absolutely loved this Kate Spade romper!","Being almost 6 feet tall, rompers rarely work for me but this one fit perfectly!","The shorts are a bit on the longer side and the waistband was elastic, making it easy to place at the most flattering part of your torso.","+ there are pockets, always a win."
"everyday","Uniquely printed DVF maxi.","I love the contrast of colors and the extra source of fabric that allows for great detailing.","Running true to size, it does run rather tight when sitting in the bust for a 34C and in the stomach area, however I were to size up it would have been way too big.","I wore this dress to work with black sneakers and a black leather jacket."
"everyday","This dress was really beautiful.","The fit is large but the material and pockets are a plus.","The one negative about the dress is that it is starting to  show its wear.","There were a few snags on the dress but not so much that it was too noticeable."
"everyday","This is a great skirt, with great fit.","The one thing that I was a little disappointed with is that it wasnt real leather."
"everyday","."
"everyday","It is warm and snug without feeling as bulky as other sweaters.","I loved the extra long sleeves-- they were a good contrast to the short length of the sweater.","I would have given 5 stars, but its more worn than other things Ive gotten from RTR.","Im sure its because once you have this you probably want to wear it a couple times since its so warm and nice."
"everyday","runs big"
"everyday","The fit was just right and it was a great dress for spring."
"everyday","cant go wrong with Equipment!"
"everyday","Beautiful shirt with nice structure.","Made for girls with tiny wastes.","I have a more square build but normally have no issues fitting in an XS."
"everyday","This sweater was really fun to wear around and perfect for that in-between weather when you arent sure if you need a jacket or not.","I got a lot of compliments on it.","Its very big and snuggly."
"everyday","I love this sweater so much that I might buy it!","It runs a little large, but I love that its a bit roomy and cozy - perfect for these cold days weve had on the east coast lately.","I have a hard time finding sweaters that are made from fabric that doesnt make me itchy, and this one is a dream.","Super comfortable, and the cold shoulder design elevates it from being just another basic sweater."
"everyday","slightly on the shorter side."
"everyday","I loved everything about this dress - fabric and pattern are beautiful, and the fit is flattering yet comfortable.","I have big arms so it fit me fairly TTS, but is very loose at the waist and chest - i think many people would be able to size down."
"everyday","I ordered this coat for every day wear and it is one of my favorite rentals so far.","You can throw it over any outfit - a nice dress or jeans and booties - for instant style.","The oversize, slouchy cut looks very fresh.","The wool is high quality, but thin, so I wouldnt recommend it for very cold temps, unless you layer with a sweater."
"everyday","Great fit, beautiful dress, it was VERY slimming.","I was showered with complements."
"everyday","This dress is so versatile!","I wore at a summer picnic with sandals on a weekend and paired with booties and a black moto jacket for work and got compliments on both.","I cant wait to rent again!"
"everyday","Super cute and easily dressed up or down.","I would size down for backup."
"everyday","These really are cute.","They have a bit of fabric to them so they can make you look a bit wider.","But overall the style is just so cute its ok to not look super skinny."
"everyday","I really like this top.","It is a light fabric that floats nicely when you move.","I wore this a few times while I had it: once with black cut-off shorts; a couple times with skinny jeans.","One day it was cooler out so I wore a black long-sleeve shirt underneath."
"everyday","Of all the dresses Ive rented via unlimited, this is the only one so far that is not true to size (including another dress by this designer).","I read the reviews and rented one size up, and even that was too small - I could not lift my arms above my head.","The color, fabric and style of the dress itself is beautiful so I am hoping to snag the next size up (2 sizes bigger than my regular size) ASAP."
"everyday","I *loved* this dress.","Its pattern is interesting and fun, the fabric lightweight and the shape beautiful.","I wore it to work and on the weekend, and it was easily made casual by pairing it with brown strappy sandals (slight heel) and a high ponytail.","If getting compliments matters to you, youll like this dress even more.","Its a crowdpleaser, and I would totally buy it if I could afford it."
"everyday","Dress was so comfortable and I loved the pattern.","I wore this a couple of different times during my rental and hated to send it back!"
"everyday","Beautiful dress - love the material - great fit!","Many, many compliments!"
"everyday","The sizing was true to size and I was able to wear a t-shirt bra underneath.","I styled with runners during the day and then heels at night- loved this dress!"
"everyday","Tight in the bust but makes them look great!","Love the shaping.","It is a warm dress, best for cooler weather."
"everyday","This was a great rental for a long week working remotely in Chicago.","It went with nearly everything I wore, and I was able to dress it up and down for work as well as nights out.","Love the detail in the back and simple cut in the front.","Would rent again!"
"everyday","Wore this dress to the office for work and then out for a dinner date with my boo.","He loved it!","Its so easy to dress up or down, and is really comfortable due to the scuba fabric construction.","It runs pretty true to size.","I generally wear anywhere between a size 8-12, and the Large was perfect for me.","I would recommend sizing up on this style.","It is tight fitting and I feel some people might like a little extra wiggle room"
"everyday","Absolutely gorgeous item.","The leather is super soft and high quality."
"everyday","It fit very comfortably.","I wore it twice.","The ruffles on the sleeve and collar were cute details.","The dress was about one inch above the knee.","Very cute dress."
"everyday","These ran large and i wish i had gotten a smaller size BUT i still wore them a few times and loved them.","i dressed them up for work with a structured peplum shirt and dressed them down with a tshirt for everyday."
"everyday","Loved the belt---made it extra flattering.","Lightweight and gorgeous color"
"everyday","great for high waisted pants, otherwise too short"
"everyday","Perfect summer Sunday Funday romper.","Casual, cute and a little bit sexy.","These are the kinds of pieces that make me love my Unlimited membership.","I would never buy this but it sure was fun to wear once!"
"everyday","and the cut outs are super cute!","However, theres a ton of extra fabric around the body, which means this looked more like a black burlap sac and less like a cute shirt dress if I wore it without heels."
"everyday","I rented size 0 for everyday wear.","More loose fit but the ties around the waist makes it work.","Love the fluttery skirt and paired it with over the knee boot for a fun work to happy hour look!"

"everyday","Great fit, comfortable and didnt wrinkle easily."
"everyday","One of the most comfortable and flattering jumpsuits Ive worn.","It runs large but I wouldnt have preferred a smaller size because I think the loose fits works.","The drawstring makes this look good on anyone.","Love the color but will probably rent again in the white.","Fabric is on the heavier side so not the greatest in hot weather."
"everyday","The quality shows in this romper.","It fits a womens figure beautifully from the bust, to the waist, to the hips!","Its perfect for a Sunday brunch or exploring a new town.","Easy and breezy.","Heads up, the neck line does come a little low but theres nothing double sided tape cant do!"
"everyday","Its easy to wear and feels casual, but theres something special about the way its cut--it just looks better than everything else like it."
"everyday","Great sweat with nice details that make it look stylish while also being cozy"
"everyday","Its gorgeous.","Requires a cami under it or something as it is sheer.","Wore it out in NYC during a spring trip, with a pink cami under it, and match my lipstick to the pink.","Was perfect with white jeans.","Would wear again, rent again, and probably even buy it!","Its flowy also, so if you go out for a big dinner, you dont have to worry."
"everyday","I loved this jacket so much--rented it as part of my unlimited subscription and wore it multiple times.","I wore it with pants and a t-shirt to a kids birthday party, over a dress to church, and with a skirt and blouse to work.","The cut is fairly tailored, but the fabric adds an element of fun beyond a regular navy blazer.","Its not terribly warm, though, so save as an outer layer until the weather outside is temperate."
"everyday","I have a larger chest, and this fit me perfectly!","I did wear a cami underneath it to not show cleavage at work - but wouldnt need one for the weekend.","The material is super soft and the tie-waist is so flattering.","Can be dressed up or down to be worn with dress pants or jean shorts.","Its even prettier in person as there is a small crochet detail at the shoulders that is hard to see in photos.","Highly recommend for spring, summer, or fall!"
"everyday","I loved the feminine look of this on the model but ended up not wearing this one as it was quite a bit puffier and prince-like in person.","If you are going for something very girly, almost poodle skirt flirty this is a great pick but if you are on the fence about how frilly this is you may want to pass as it is certainly more so in person.","The material was lovely and the piece was very high quality."
"everyday","The jacket is oversized but runs a little big.","Im in between sizes 8-10, but since Im on unlimited, I tend to size up to be on the safe side that an item fits.","That being said, this one did feel a little too big for a size 10 (even if its an oversized design).","Ill rent a size smaller (8) next time, but for the day that I did wear it, I received several compliments.","I couldnt tell whether the fabric was overworn or thats how it is supposed to appear, so Ill have to try a different size and get back to folks."

"everyday","Pros: The pattern is truly unique.","I received tons of compliments on it when I wore this out to dinner.","The change in hemline is interesting too.","Cons: It definitely seems like it should be a summer dress, but the fabric is quite heavy.","It also wrinkles easily."
"everyday","Runs about a size too small.","Beautiful dress though."
"everyday","This is one of my favorite dresses ever.","Its comfortable, loose and flowy, but is also extremely flattering.","The fabric is great - beautiful, delicate pattern and wrinkle free.","I wore for everyday but bought it and plan to wear to my bridal shower."

"everyday","I rented this as my free birthday dress from RTR and felt like a million bucks.","I rented a 2 and a 4, and while the 2 fit better around my torso, my arms were a bit too muscular for the tight sleeves (thanks wedding workout).","The 4 was a bit loose but comfy during the day.","I received lots of compliments and would definitely rent again."
"everyday","True to size.","Comfortable and I was able to wear it a few times before returning."
"everyday","I wore this to brunch on an unusually warm day in April, and it was perfect.","I wore it loose, but also tried it with a belt which was flattering.","Beware of sudden breezes though!","Due to the handkerchief style, the entire skirt billows up in stronger winds."
"everyday","I sized up and this still was not wearable for me.","It showed too much cleavage.","Material is also a very thin jersey and shows everything."
"everyday","?","?"
"everyday","I think that  I could have sized down and got the XS.","I thought that it ran a little large.","I am 54 and wore wedges and the length was perfect in the S.  I did wear a black cami under this bc I was attending afternoon casual but semi conservative event and it made me more comfortable.","This is such a cute, casual and comfortable outfit."
"everyday","Perfect casual dress for warm weather.","Wore it twice!","Wrinkles easy.","Super comfortable.","Lots of compliments!"
"everyday","I loved the colors in this sweater!","I am typically a size 4, and would normally opt for a Small, but wore a Medium in this sweater.","I recommend going a size up if you like more room and staying true to size if you prefer a more tailored fit.","This sweater is perfect for everyday and can be paired nicely with a collared shirt underneath for work or more casually with jeans and boots like I did!"

"everyday","Very roomy and comfy.","This is what I would want to wear if I was pregnant.","I wore it on a sunday for brunch at home and to wine-tasting in the afternoon.","It fealt like a more glamorous alternative to sweats.","The big baggy shape is not sexy, but ok if you just want to be comfy.","It probably made me look a good 10-15 lbs heavier"
"everyday","Loved it, felt great, looked great."
"everyday","Im in love with this dress.","Its so light and comfortable.","Its short so I wore it with leggings.","I got so many compliments."

"everyday","Great fit, this romper gives you a nice silhouette"
"everyday","I love this jacket & am so grateful to be able to enjoy the gorgeous piece!","Thank you RTR"
"everyday","I have an athletic shape and the shirt was fitted in the shoulders for me- a larger size would have compensated for that.","But as the previous reviewer mentioned, the shirt has no shape and is really boxy.","I also did not like the collar fit on me (maybe my neck is too short).","Shirt would also look better with the matching pants.","I did not wear it."
"everyday","I typically wear between a 2 and 4 and the 36 fit great.","The sleeves/shoulders ran a bit on the tighter side, so if you are planning to wear a heavier sweater underneath Id size up.","Its a good coat for 40 degree weather (so spring/fall).","The fit of the coat is a bit on the boxy side, so you do need the belt to cinch and define the waist.","It has a cool military vibe and the leather details give it a more luxurious feel.","I rented through Unlimited and only returned as I needed the space to rent a gown for an event, will be renting again ASAP and holding onto for awhile."
"everyday","I thought with the oversize fit this would run large.","I was wrong.","Should have ordered a medium.","Was very tight across top of arms and restricted movement.","Gorgeous top though.","Many compliments from the husband."

"everyday","It was a little big.","I might have actually been able to wear a small and Im not really a small..."
"everyday","This was an adorable sweater.","I originally wanted to wear it with nothing underneath, but it was way too itchy and I had to wear a camisole.","Changed the look a bit, but still glad I rented it."
"everyday","im typically btwn 2 and 4, usually 2 in erin.","the 2 fit w plenty of room so if youre btwn sizes 100% size down.","hit about an inch or so above my knee, wore a reg bra.","color combo is great for brunch, showers, etc.","highly recommend for any occasion that requires you to look conservative without looking boring.","great dress!"
"everyday","I wore this to work and was able to get away with it for a day in the office but Im not sure I would be comfortable wearing it to a work event or meeting.","It was a bit short and I felt like I was always tugging it down with just tights on.","Im on 54 so I imagine on a taller gal, its that much worse."
"everyday","I wore the UK Size 12 and it was tight in the hips, so size up if youre hippy like me.","Otherwise, it was very fun and is mid-thigh.","Fun assymetrical look (which I usually hate) and paired it with tights for a winter night out."
"everyday","its roomy and has pockets!!!","!"
"everyday","This dress fits me great.","I love it so much I purchased it."
"everyday","Fit perfectly!","Cute see through bomber great for everyday use.","<3 <3"

"everyday","It was simple, but trendy with the leather sleeves, and kept me warm."
"everyday","Must wear a strapless bra due to the slits."
"everyday","Definitely not a work friendly dress if you are a taller woman, unless you plan on wearing thick tights underneath.","Unfortunately, I was not able to get much use from the dress because it rode up on my hips a lot.","This is not unusual for me as I have a fairly large backside and wide hips.","Super cute dress, super well made, probably better for women with a straighter frame.","Good for cooler weather."
"everyday","I loved this dress.","You could dress it up with edgy booties or casual with converse sneakers.","I highly recommend this dress.","I almost didnt give it back."
"everyday","Very versatile jacket.","Absolutely love it.","Fits a little on the big side.","If you are in between sizes, definitely size down.","I normally wear a large or size 10 in tops and I definitely could have worn the 8."
"everyday","I rented for 4th of July dinner out and everyday.","Its a little too fancy for everyday but appropriate for upscale lunch/dinner or event wear.","It does run long and is a bit heavy and hot but worth it.","People stopped me in the streets to ask about the dress."
"everyday","True To Size"
"everyday","Pretty and comfortable...","I got this in my unlimited order and wore it to work one day.","Every was commenting on how pretty this dress is.","Need to wear a strapless bra with it.","Love!"
"everyday","I absolutely loved this dress!","The pattern matched with the tiny pleats was beautiful and the tasteful cutouts at the top made this still feel like a youthful style despite the length.","I would definitely  recommend that anyone considering renting this piece size up, however.","My measurements are H: 34, W:24 B: 34 and this was comfortable at my waist, tight at my bust and there was no stretch in the top of the dress..","If I were to rent this again, I would probably do the size 2 rather than the 0.","Also, at 55 this came to my ankles, so for more petite women this could easily become a floor length style.","I wore this with black ankle boots, but as the weather warms up this would look beautiful with a nude or black strappy sandal and simple jewelry."
"everyday","This coat is so beautiful and perfect for every occasion.","The fur collar is detachable, but I would never detach it because of how much I love it.","I think this coat can be dressed up or down, it has a loose fit but it looks very chic and stylish.","It is not super warm, but with another later underneath or a scarf can be comfortably for a NY winter night."
"everyday","Wore this top out for a night with friends.","So comfortable and flattering.","Runs true too size....it is supposed to be a little lose, which I love!"
"everyday","I didnt get to wear it because the back was too baggy and open.","Wasnt flattering.",":("
"everyday","I love this jacket so much.","I got a small instead of xs because I wanted to be able to wear it over everything and not feel squashed and it is definitely plenty roomy - I think if I get it again I would try the xs but the small is also great.","Its a good transitional jacket - neither winter-warm nor light enough for those days when you only maybe needed a jacket, Ive been wearing this in high 40s through low 60s temps and its perfect.","I am updating this review because I saw another reviewer complain about the fake pockets - that is incorrect and this jacket DOES have side pockets, its just if you are the first person to get it they will be tacked shut and you will have to pull the string out to use them.","But they are really great deep pockets that fit your hands and a big iphone too!"
"everyday","This flouncy blue Rebecca Minkoff top is my absolute favorite.","It runs true to size, but if youre between sizes I would size down as it is pretty loose.","The arms were a bit long on me, but they can easily be pulled up!","I left the neck strings untied and it looked great, but you could also tie it into a neck bow if thats more your thing!","Ive rented this top twice now and always want to keep it every time.","You can dress it up or down easily by changing out pants/shoes!","It goes with everything (jeans, culottes, dress pants, etc.)","and the color is a pale blue which matches others so nicely!","Highly recommend this rental!"
"everyday","Ruffles and a floral print make this dress perfect for a spring or summer day!","Running true to size with room in the bust we recommend sizing down for backup.","Although there is no stretch in the fabric this style should fit most bust sizes and allow for a strapless bra underneath.","Theres a small snap button on the front that allows for an adjustable v neckline.","Waist is fitted and stretchy, allowing for movement.","At 57 the dress hit about mid-thigh.","Pair with your summer sandals and a satchel for an easy and effortless look."
"everyday","Although the dress was slightly long for my height, I was able to wear it perfectly with a pair of mid heels sandals."
"everyday","Didnt wear - would not recommend."
"everyday","Rented this for everyday/ weekend getaway in the late Spring and got so many compliments!","A-line shape is very flattering for girls without much of a waist, and the cut on the arms makes your shoulders look toned!","Im a true 4 and the dress fit me perfectly- only problem was that the band got a little tight after a large brunch.",":) Didnt need to wear a bra, as the fabric is quite thick.","Great casual/ vacation running around dress!","Def would rent again."

"everyday","Wore it twice.","Once with jeans/beige heels and once with white jeans.","I received so many compliments, everyone wanted to know who the designer was.","LOVED it."
"everyday","Fits true to size, maybe just slightly on the bigger side.","I am 58 and it was a good length.","I would definitely recommend this piece."
"everyday","Loved this peasant top.","Great for casual but nice events or daytime.it ran a little large but luckily since its a flowy peasant top, it doesnt really detract from the overall look."
"everyday","This was my first DVF dress and it wont be my last.","The wrap dress accentuated curves, but still looked professional enough for a work event.","The material was high quality, but not to thick or hot for Florida weather."
"everyday","Its a little big so I couldve definitely worn the 0 but the 2 fit well, too."
"everyday","Loved everything about this dress, wish i could have bought it!"
"everyday","Really liked the look online, just not a good fit for my body type.","Probably best on a tall, slender non-busty figure."
"everyday","My husband complimented me all day in this dress.","I wore it to work and then to a photo shoot.","I paired it with a coral Stella & Dot necklace and black wedges.","The armpits of the dress were a little tight, but worth it for how the dress fit.","I loved this dress and felt great in it!","Ill definitely rent it again."
"everyday","I wore this to work and there was some discussion as to what animal is on this sweater.","The only drawback is I was so hot wearing this.","Its quite a heavy sweater."
"everyday","LOVED this top.","So gorgeous.","Wore with white pants and heels out to dinner (in Florida) and with jeans to someones house for a casual dinner.","So beautiful.","Will rent again."
"everyday","Pretty shirt with gold accents.","You could dress it up or down.","BUT it runs very large.","Very low cut and shoulders kept falling down.","I had to basically fashion tape it to my body."
"everyday","This is a knit dress which I was surprised about at first but I loved it!","I wore it to work with black heels and fun chunky black necklace.","I got so many compliments and it was soooo comfortable.","I would def rent again"

"everyday","I loved almost everything about this top.","Id give the fabric, pattern, and overall fit 5 stars.","The only downside was the bows on the sleeves which my husband had to re-tie about 10 times throughout the night!","They came undone very easily which made it annoying to wear."
"everyday","this is the perfect fall sweater - it looks really expensive and high quality.","looks amazing with skinny jeans and booties.","there are holes in the pattern so you need to wear a tank top underneath."
"everyday","I have been searching for a perfect, go-to leather jacket for almost 2 years now, its been a tough search.","This jacket beyond fit the bill.","The leather is soft and the fit is just amazing, I found most leathers were bulky but this jacket laid perfectly and was just the right amount of edge while still feeling lady-like.","I also really like that all the hardware was black, I think it looked a bit more classy without the metallic contrast.","Just a pure gem."
"everyday","I thought it would be big, roomy and poncho like but it was much larger than I predicted in the M/L.","I am usually a size 10."
"everyday","This dress is actually made of a sweatshirt-like material, so its thick and doesnt drape well.","It also runs huge.","I wore the 6 (British sizing, and the smallest size it was offered in, and an equivalent to a US 2) and I was basically swimming in it.","On the plus side, its quite comfortable and warm."
"everyday","The length fell at the hip and looked great with both shorts and jeans."
"everyday","Dress is beautiful, wore this wine tasting in napa, got tons of compliments.","its short, i couldnt  have worn heels (54)."
"everyday","I rented this as part of my Unlimited subscription and would rent again.","It is a stretchy, breathable fabric that is warm and also flattering.","The cutout sleeves are very on-trend and the length is appropriate for work while not being too formal to wear on a weekend day.","I layered this with a leather jacket while in the mountains of Bogota but wore it alone in Miami wintertime, and was completely comfortable in both climates."
"everyday","What a fun, easy jacket!","Great for those cool-ish days and nights.","No true pockets but not a huge deal in my opinion.","I wanted to keep forever but returned because its hard to wear a winter coat over and not warm enough to wear alone (brrr Chicago!).","Best when a heavier coat is not needed.","Ill surely be renting again in the spring!"
"everyday","I loved this dress and felt so luxe wearing it.","It kind of reminded me of something out of the late 60s with the big primary color buttons, so I paired it with platform penny loafers and I felt fabulous.","The back of the dress is flouncy and fun, but be careful when youre standing up or walking outside so that the wind doesnt give you a Marilyn moment.","The dress does arrive in a wrinkled state, but I was able to steam that out.","Loved this and would definitely rent again!"
"everyday","Great for work, really easy to wear, and not too short."
"everyday","Great jacket and style.","Like the other reviews say, the back is fairly short, but if you already know that, it doesnt end up being a big deal.","The jacket was very easy to dress up and down."
"everyday","I loved the design and the material, but the arms were very tight on me - so I found myself a bit uncomfortable most of the day.","Id love it sized up!"
"everyday","I want to live in this dress all winter, please.","Its flattering, sexy, but also work-safe with the high neck line.","Im 57 and 130lbs of hourglass curves ATM, and Im wearing the medium, which gives a nice silhouette without being too tight.","Im used to being closer to 120lbs, but I still feel confident and attractive in this dress."

"everyday","This is a great dress.","Flirty and fun.","Fabric is lightweight."
"everyday","true to size, super cute, good quality,"
"everyday","Dress is made very well, fits true to size.","Would love it if it wasnt so long on me...Im 50"
"everyday","Loved the colors and style of this piece but the stylist was right in that there in NO stretch in the waist, I was barely able to get the 8 zipped up but the length on the legs was also too short for my 510 frame.","Ill probably try re-renting in a larger size to see if that fixes both of my issues - the style is too beautiful to not try again!"
"everyday","Wore it with suede knee high boots so much fun for a girls night or date night!"
"everyday","I received so many compliments on this.","Very unique top.","Light weight and the white isnt at all sheer."

"everyday","Great everyday vest.","Loved the interesting cut in the front.","Tempted to buy it because I know it would be versatile.","Cant think of one bad thing about this piece."

"everyday","You will not regret renting this.","Perfect for your body in every way.","Nothing bad to say about this one."
"everyday","Im 511 and 142 pounds, and the size 40 fit perfectly!","So rare to find a dress that is not only the perfect length (just above the knee) but also the waist isnt too high.","Its so flattering and follows my shape perfectly, so even though its a very ladylike dress, its also somehow sexy!","The only problem is that the fabric seems to absorb odors and so it smelled under the arms from the person before me.","I dry cleaned it but it didnt really help.","I sent it back after two wearings, but if it hadnt smelled I would have kept it longer."
"everyday","a little roomy but that was fine - fit easily over sweaters, etc.","might order a size down next time."

"everyday","too shiny"
"everyday","Super comfortable, cool, and casual."
"everyday","Im typically a 6-8 and I got a 4 and it worked for me.","I dont have a huge chest area though, so perhaps thats why I didnt have an issue.","I also recommend this dress for taller women as well.","The fabric is a bit thicker, so itd be better for a summer evening.","I ended up not wearing this dress because I didnt like how the front of the dress pleated, it looked a bit awkward.","I can tell that this dress could be cute too, just wasnt for me.","4 stars!"
"everyday","I rented this after seeing it worked well for another new mom.","I think it just hit me in the wrong places because of my height.","The elastic waistband just fell on the worst place I think it could have.","Super cute and soft fabric, though!"

"everyday","Loved the color, the fit was loose."
"everyday","easy chic turtleneck.","cute casual or with blk leather pants for going out."
"everyday","Light weight jacket, good for spring or early fall.","Im 54, 110 lbs and the XS was a perfect fit--I was able to wear it over a sweater with no problem, but over a T-Shirt would have been fine too.","For me, the color of the jacket made it appear to be a less quality item, but it was soft to the touch.","I wanted something different other than the usual black leather jacket, but when eventually purchase one, it will be black.","Just meh for me on this one."

"everyday","Nothing but great things!","Very comfortable and flowy."

"everyday","My office is a bit more casual, it is a bit short!"
"everyday","I LOVED this romper!","Thought about buying....gorgeous color, great fit.","Can easily dress up or down.","Only downside is it is low cut.","Maybe I just dont have enough of a chest to fill it out, but did struggle with showing my bra.","A great rental!"
"everyday","I rented this for a brunch with the girls but winded up returning it.","I am bustier so this may be a better shirt for someone with less of that going on, but for me it showed WAY too much and was impossible to get on by myself (dont rent if you dont live with someone).","The sides tie together.","It is short and I tried to on with jeans but if just made me look frumpy."
"everyday","i cannot get over how amazing this piece is!!!","the color is gorgeous, the material is amazing, and it is just so so well made.","i am usually btwn a 2 and 4, but sound the S to be a bit too big.","i know it isnt supposed to be tight, but when buttoned up it just had too much room around the chest so i will def try the XS next time.","this is the perfect fall piece.","i had leggings, flats, and a plain T, but throwing this over that really made the outfit.","it is def something you want to wear to an outdoor event so you dont need to take it off.","the pockets are also awesome.","i really cant say enough about this.","i am very seriously considering purchasing it!"
"everyday","The material for this skirt was very well constructed.","The 6R sent was a size small, so had I known that I would have sized up to get a medium, but besides that, it seems to be TTS.","Im 58 and the skirt was nearly ankle length on me and I had it at my belly button, if not higher.","The Medium would have been better."
"everyday","Ran small, nothing too exciting about this.","The white part is see-through.","I was a little self conscious of my belly button being visible through the sheer, but the shirt ran so small that I couldnt wear a tank underneath it.","I wouldnt recommend this shirt."
"everyday","Very easy to wear; paired with jeans and loved it!"
"everyday","This dress fit great and was very comfortable.","It was snug in the waist, as expected, but not restricting.","The skirt was full without being poofy.","Fit was tight but comfortable in the chest.","The length was mid-thigh and not too short even for my long legs.","The dress is starting to show some wear but isnt very noticeable from a distance.","It was a perfect versatile piece, great for hourglass or pear figures."

"everyday","Comfortable dress, I dont think it runs as small as a lot of the other Elizabeth and James dresses, although runs slightly small.","Wasnt too short, but the cutout is a nice detail"
"everyday","a little large for size"
"everyday","this sweater is huge but very cozy.","it was great for watching the snow falling outside"
"everyday","I dont typically rent the same item twice, but this one is definitely a candidate.","I got it to wear to a trip to Crater Lake (freezing) and ended up wearing it everywhere.","I wore it to the gym, to pick up my daughter, for weekends, anywhere.","It is cozy and has just enough european flair to stand out."
"everyday","I cant imagine this being a flattering cut on anyone.","It has two waistlines and creates bulkiness to the slower belly.","Very odd.","Just not a special item.","Sent back without wearing."
"everyday","I am an unlimited subscriber and Ive tried a lot of pieces for work or going out, and this has been one of my favorites so far.","I wore it to a kids birthday party, then on a date night, then I paired it with a black cardigan for work.","Very versatile.","Im always between a size 8 and 10, so I got the 10 and was very comfortable.","But it moves well and the waist is stretchy, so an 8 probably wouldve worked too.","I loved the crepe material and the pattern.","It can wrinkle, so I probably wouldnt try to wear it anywhere important.","But Overall, better than I expected."

"everyday","The sleeve on me was definitely 3/4 length, but with the fun styling of the sleeve was not an issue.","I am small busted and small framed and the Medium was definitely fitted.","Material could be softer and I would have loved it even more."
"everyday","Way to big, should have gone with a size 0.","The coat is beautiful and fun, loved the hot pink lining.","Sent back because I looked like I was swimming.","I am a size 4-6 in clothes, this coat runs super big."
"everyday","Loved the color but definitely was boxy.","Didnt show off any curves so was rather blah."
"everyday","Super cozy can be worn with jeans, leather pants or leggings  - perfect for the fall"
"everyday","This dress was so cute and fun!","Unfortunately mine didnt come with the belt, but I ended up wearing it anyway (I actually didnt realize the belt was missing until I looked in the mirror and noticed the belt loops) and got lots of compliments."
"everyday","This sweater dress is fine - its somewhat cute, but not one of my favorites.","I wore it to work with tights and boots.","Its not unflattering but I also wouldnt say the shape or pattern does any favors either."
"everyday","I rented this for our family photos and was quite pleased.","The fit was just as described, slightly cropped, I wore it with high-waisted jeans and it fell at just the right place.","Many reviews stated that the arms were tight, however I didnt experience this, they were actually slightly baggy, especially below the elbow.","The color was great, a perfect wine/magenta shade that photographed well."
"everyday","This dress is cozy for the winter however it is way too short (even with tights)."
"everyday","i really liked it, just knocked off a star because it ran quite large, making the gap in the front very significant.","i am typically btwn a 2 and a 4 and opted for the 4 in this dress.","the dress sags a lot in the front, it is likely the style, not just the sizing.","i wore a tank under to combat the issue.","overall its very nice, but not one of my favorite dresses of this style.","it looks rather casual.","im on the fence about the print.","i like it, but looks a touch like a blouse my grandmother would wear.","not a bad pick, but definitely not my favorite"
"everyday","Perfect in every way."
"everyday","Super comfortable & stylish.","Cant say enough good things about it."
"everyday","The colors on this are amazing.","Tons of compliments at work."
"everyday","The fit was confusing- I am a 2 so it was snug on my hips but loose on my waist.","Anyway theres so much pattern and color going on that no one would notice the gap.","Id still rent it again."
"everyday","Unless youre going for the I-can-see-your-bra look, you definitely need to wear an undershirt with this one since the fabric is tissue-paper thin--dont let the bold pattern fool you in the low lighting of your bedroom!","Also, although I sized up, this runs pretty short in the body and sleeves."
"everyday","Loved this dress!","So comfortable, however I would recommend sizing up.","I have a bigger backside and this was tighter than i would have liked around the hip/butt area.","It was an adorable dress though and I would definitely recommend it."
"everyday","Wish I would have ordered at size 2.","I Loved the fabric and the design."
"everyday","Cool design.","I may re-rent in a different size.","Love the piece."
"everyday","This is one great coat!","Ive rented it twice now, once in an 8 and another time in a 10, and both sizes worked.","Every time I wear it I receive compliments.","If I could find it online I would probably purchase it!"
"everyday","I rented this dress to wear to brunch but the brunch was cancelled so I ended up wearing it to my moms birthday lunch.","The silk material was comfortable and lovely, but the dress felt a little dressy for every day .","Normally I would wear a floral maxi out regularly but the silk made this feel like more of an occasion dress.","It is cut well, flattering and not poofy, and the floral print is chic."
"everyday","These will be great for the fall/winter, but I didnt get to wear them because they are so thick it would have been too hot.","I tried them on and the fit was great, I probably could have gone a size up and they would have still fit.","Obviously well made."
"everyday","Fit true to size"
"everyday","throw on over a relaxed pant or skinny jean - easy to look polished."

"everyday","Fit is true to size.","Great sweater."
"everyday","The fabric is so soft and sits perfectly even with the pockets.","I was a little worried about the busy pattern but the tailored look of this dress won me over.","Its fitted up top and through arms (Im a true 0) but the bottom half is forgiving.","It leaves room for you to eat without worrying but not so bulky that you look frumpy.","Rent this!"
"everyday","It creates a nice shape because it accentuates the waits yet it could hide problem areas if the tummy/waist is your problem area.","No need to wear a bra!"
"everyday","I rented this great little number for an event, and found the cotton too casual for evening, but the skirt was fantastic to wear to school events (I was the most fashionable mom at the 1st grade Zoo play in this and a chambray oxford) and a lunch out.","Im not sure if it is from wash or the color on the photo is off, but the skirt background is pale pink, not cream or white as it appears.","This would look great with a black tee or tank, as well.","The waistband is stretch but not too stretchy, and the fabric is light as air, but still has some volume."
"everyday","if youre a little bigger on the butt/hip area, it was a bit narrow so you might want to go a size up...","Im pretty proportional and it was JUST big enough for me."
"everyday","This dress had an odor, which is why it did not get 5 stars.","I usually wear a size 4, but in DVF wrap dresses, I always get a 6, because my bust is large."

"everyday","The fit was great.","I do wish the front was just a little longer.","I kept having to pull it down when I walked.","I did love the print and the design."
"everyday","Another anti-cheeky fave!","Hem perfectly highlighted the fact that I work out and hid the fact that I hate cardio.","I ate 3 full appetizers (plates, not bites), washed them down with cheap tequila and the belt didnt make me feel like I was puking a snake.","The adorable collar ruffles kept me classy when my alcohol tolerance challenged me.","I will be buying this piece!"
"everyday","I like this piece, its a good neutral color.","I was surprised to find out how heavy it is- if planning to travel with it, you may want to rethink.","Or if youll be shopping and going inside and need to carry it around.","It is seriously probably 10 pounds."
"everyday","This dress is great for a real hot summer day!","Its cute and interesting.","I included the back shot so you can see that it is a bit unique."
"everyday","This was my favorite dress I rented so far.","Looks flattering!","Will rent it again!"
"everyday","Nice floaty fabric.","Didnt end up wearing it."
"everyday","I love Diane Von Furstenberg and know exactly how her dresses will fit.","This dress is not structured but draped beautifully all around.","I wore with the Valentino rock stud wedge sandals with the turquoise studs and it looked so beautiful.","I received many compliments from the restaurant staff and my family.","I will definitely rent again!"
"everyday","Rented this for everyday.","It has no buttons so it would open up even when belted, that was bothersome.","But on warm days it was great to just keep it open with a pop of color on the collar.","Beautiful fabric!","The sleeve were long on me, I folded them up twice .","The hem hit me at my knee."
"everyday","I loved the very smooth fabric.","It felt very cool and comfortable."
"everyday","The sleeves make it; comfortable to wear and quite fashionable.","Light fabric yet with body.","Great occasional dress."

"everyday","0"
"everyday","Great fabric, light and fresh, ideal for summer"
"everyday","I was looking for a better cut of the jacket.","I have the expectation of a narrower waist on this kind of jacket.","The waist seemed to be big for the size of the jacket.","Others may not notice, but this is something Im rather picky about.","Other than the fit, the color is great!","I ended up not wearing it due to the fit & that I have a similar coat in a lighter color and went with that."
"everyday","I rented a medium, which is fine, but the small would have been ideal.","I have wore it multiple times...a night out in NYC with black ripped jeans and black heeled booties, running errands with dark-washed jeans and a leather bomber jacket etc...","I will rent this again, but in a small."
"everyday","The fit was comfy without being too baggy.","The knit was high-quality so it was not necessary to wear a tank top underneath.","The beads are a little more noticeable than I had expected, so this sweater does make a bit of a statement."
"everyday","Nice heavy coat, but unfortunately the Texas weather took a turn for the hot so was unable to wear it.","Beautiful dark green color with soft leather accents.","Very comfy!","Fits true to size."
"everyday","I wore this for a night out to dinner and drinks with my girlfriends.","I love the off the shoulder look and this did not disappoint.","It was a little difficult to keep the sleeves down at all times, but you can also adjust and wear as more of a cowl neck sweater, which still looks great.","I received compliments from all of my friends!"
"everyday","I got a number of uses out of this through my unlimited rotation, and liked how easy I could throw it on and look put together.","It has a sort of boxy, boyish oversized look to it, so I wouldnt recommend it if youre looking to show off curves.","I would also probably size down to achieve a little more form on the body."
"everyday","great color, fit, quality.","a great classic piece."
"everyday","I got a lot of complements on this jacket, especially the silver color.","However, it fit just a little smaller than I would like overall, but the belt could have used one or two more notches as it was a little big and hung down.","I made it work."
"everyday","I wore this to Thanksgiving dinner and havent stopped thinking about it since.","Its surprisingly thicker than what I was expecting and such a statement piece to wear with just basic black jeans and black turtleneck."
"everyday","silk, flattering, beautiful print"
"everyday","great lace cutouts on the sleeves"
"everyday","This dress has a fun 70s feel to it.","The material in great to transition from summer to fall and would look great with tights.","The material is also great as it is a sweater material.","I highly recommend renting!"
"everyday","Fit well in the upper chest.","The back was loose and flowy as advertised.","The bean in the picture shows how the back flowed."
"everyday","Perfect for everyday wear, while the gold buttons make it nice enough to dress up an outfit if you like.","The material is soft, and the color (pink) was light enough to match well with a lot of other colors.","True to size, though I got one size larger to make layering easier."
"everyday","Comfortable and cute.","Great for everyday on vacation."
"everyday","I love Vince, and I really wanted this to work.","Its very cocoon shaped and its very short!","Im short, so be prepared if you are taller than I am.","If it wasnt for the length I probably would have kept it, it seems warm and the fit overall was nice."
"everyday","Wore this to school event.","My husband really liked it which says a ton.","He doesnt often comment on any clothes.","A little hard to figure out how to put on for someone short on time trying to throw it on.","Very cute though and would definitely recommend."

"everyday","Love it so much I decided to keep it.","It fits perfectly, is so soft, and looks extremely nice.","I would definitely recommend to anyone!"
"everyday","The fit is perfect as I typically wear between a Small and Medium, especially for jackets.","I highly recommend this jacket for a special event, or for the fall/winter season."
"everyday","Trendy and fun.","Not normal sweatshirt material - very thick and stretchy, almost like a sweater.","Super warm.","Definitely runs large (the small was great for me, normally size 6/8 with broad shoulders)."
"everyday","This was a cute spring dress in a fun print.","The fabric was high quality; however, it was getting a bit worn.","Length was great since I am only 50, and was work appropriate after throwing on a cardigan.","Received many compliments!","I can usually either wear a 0 or 00 but I am glad in this instance I ended up getting the 38 instead of the 36."
"everyday","This shirt has very nice coloring and the buttons elevate the top.","Unfortunately there wasnt anything special about this item and looked a bit sloppy on."
"everyday","The coat was too big for me, so I had to return it, will try and get the XS"
"everyday","The dress is a bit more formal than it appears and heavier material.","The hem was also a bit long (I am 57 tall) butstill flattering.","People loved the dress!"
"everyday","I ordered the small or a roomier fit as my bust is small.","Glad I did because the XS might have been too short lengthwise over my stomach to wear to work.","I was also worried about sleeve length as I am petite but they werent too long!","YAY!","Would rent again."
"everyday","I love the color and material of this jacket, it was just a bit snug (and I have very skinny arms).","I recommend going a size up."
"everyday","I rented this as part of my unlimited subscription because I wanted things for every day.","It was fine, and is definitely high-quality and well-made, but wasnt exactly slimming.","It tends to look a little matronly on a larger chest like mine, as do a lot of tops with a high neckline."
"everyday","Each time I wear this romper, I receive so many compliments.","I love wearing it.","I can wear to work with a cardigan, out to dinner, or just relaxing at home.","Its flattering and a beautiful blush color."
"everyday","Love the fit, was very comfortable and just the right for work and looked nice without a jacket for a night out on the town."
"everyday","I loved this dress and wore it multiple times - it was great for work, dinner, and a party, and it packs well.","Its really feminine and adorable, and I got a ton of compliments.","Also, pockets!","It looks great with black tights if youre wearing it in the winter.","I did rent it previously in a 38, and the top wouldnt zip (Im usually a 2).","The 40 fit perfectly.","I highly recommend it!"
"everyday","This dress was great.","Wore it for work travel and it stayed good looking all day long.","I highly recommend."
"everyday","back of dress almost hit the floor on me - Im 54.","Didnt end up wearing it because I was hoping for a more midi-length."
"everyday","Do not try to size down for this skirt.","If you are in-between sizes, go for the larger size...your waist will thank you."
"everyday","This coat was simply adorable.","Each time I wore it out I received compliments.","Be it at the grocery store, at church or picking up the kids, people consistently complimented me on this coat.","The top is quite a bit form fitting so I wouldnt recommend wearing this if you are planning to sport multiple layers underneath.","I found the weight to be great for fall, but not a heavy jacket for winter.","Overall, one of my favorite rentals."
"everyday","TTS fit that likely works best for average or tall women without a large bust (as it is cut quite low in the front).","I packed it in a suitcase and it traveled well....it also looked pretty cute with a black cami underneath for work.","I *loved* the movement of the pleats and the layers.","Great dress!"
"everyday","This is a very nicely made fitted sheath, with some give to it to the fabric.","This is a thinner jersey than some Mischkas.","Bust fit perfectly and roomy in the hips, but Im straight up and down.","If you are bustier you might want to size up.","Id like to buy it.","Great dress and just my style."
"everyday","Very modern.","Great fabric, great fit and very flattering.","I wore it to work and make it more causal with sandals and a coral necklace.","Loved it and could have easily dressed it up for a wedding or evening event."
"everyday","This was SO comfortable to wear.","I considered flat out buying it, but its a little unique so its tough to wear often.","I wore this to a state fair with friends and it was really cute and comfortable while still being casual.","I wore with shorts and flip flops.","Its definitely billowy and big, which is what I was looking for while stuffing my face with fair food and drinks."
"everyday","I received so many compliments on this top.","Its a great piece for both everyday and also for work as its easy to dress up or down.","I wore a 2 and found it to be somewhat cropped.","With high-waisted pants it was fine, but with lower cut jeans you may be showing some skin.","Otherwise great fit everywhere else."
"everyday","I loved the dress, but it is very form fitting.","I am almost always a 6, and if not a 6 a 4, and I wished Id rented the 8 here."
"everyday","Lots of structure in this cute little top, but nothing really memorable about it.","Just cute!"
"everyday","This dress is a little short for the office but it didnt stop me from wearing it there with a blazer overtop"
"everyday","Loved the top and the ruched detail on the back.","Very flattering and comfortable to wear.","I wore with jeans but could also see this paired with khaki pants or a skirt for business casual."
"everyday","Wore to formal church event.","Style zips up back and straps come across neck- the rest of the dress is loose so either 2 or 4 would have worked on me - I chose the smaller and used the fabric ribbon belt at my natural waist line.","Length hit my calf (53) which is different than model shows but the style with heels is cute at this longer length too.","The color is soft pink with blue flowers and small pops of coral.","The pleats give this dress movement and make it unique.","One of my favorite details.","I received many compliments!","I wore a sweater in the church service (due to A/C) but the style is modest for any event.","> This dress would be cute for maternity as the waist and hips are not defined (size up for chest change or late pregnancy)"
"everyday","This coat can be dressed up for dressed down.","I could have gone with a size 6 but the 8 was still flattering.","I love the color it goes with everything."
"everyday","waist slimming.","hit at knee.","Hope to buy it."
"everyday","Cute Top but short in arm length and tight around the neck."
"everyday","This dress is cute!","I felt so comfortable in it all day!","The pictures show that the straps may be adjustable, but they are not, so it sat a bit low and the straps would fall off if I was sitting."
"everyday","This dress is definitely cute and completely forgiving on any problem spots.","Plan on wearing something black beneath it or as a swim suit coverup because it has 2 triangle shaped cut outs beneath your arms.","34C bust pulled a little bit on the top button.","I loved the color and the fabric and would probably purchase if it werent for the cut outs."
"everyday","Fitted arm, shorter waist jacket.","Tons of compliments.","Soft leather, inside arm fabric is very comfortable.","Beautiful rich color.","Great for fall or holidays"
"everyday","My favorite thing about this jacket is the rich wine color!","Its beautiful.","The fur collar is also removable but Ive kept it on for added warmth.","The only downsides are there is only one button which isnt super secure to keep the heavy coat closed and prevent it from blowing open in the wind.","Also, the fur sheds a lot so be prepared for that.","Overall Ive had this one for about three weeks and havent sent it back yet, so I love it!"
"everyday","Received a ton of compliments.","Great fit and style.","Highly recommended."
"everyday","I rented this to wear to dinner with my parents but ended up keeping for a day at work as well.","Easy to pair with black dress pants or jeans.","It fits quite well, even if busty, and the sheer sleeves are nice for transitioning seasons."

"everyday","Too short and the arms are too baggy.","Didnt end up wearing it."
"everyday","I wore this dress for 3 days in a row #shameless.","It isnt exactly the perfect fit for busty babes like myself, but if you swap your padded bra for a bralette youll have no issues.","Perfect for travel, very comfortable.","I wore this to work and church the next day.","Great rental."
"everyday","The horizontal stripes make it not totally flattering, but the sheer black panel breaks up the effect and up the appeal factor.","I enjoyed this sweater a lot when I was off-duty!","Perfect for weekend with jeans and boots, or even a more casual workday."
"everyday","I would order a size down for my backup size.","Its perfect with leggings or narrow pants."
"everyday","."
"everyday","I realize this is on the lower price scale, which is one reason I ordered it~I was thinking if it looked good, I would buy it for 30% off.","Unfortunately the fabric looked a little cheap and I ended up sending it back.","Still giving it 4 stars because I feel like it would be flattering on a lot of different people and would work for a lot of different occasions."

"everyday","The material is brilliant and comfy.","I love the simplicity of this dress!","Great with heels or sandals, easy to dress up or down - great for curvy women too!"
"everyday","Rented this sweater for everyday as part of my unlimited subscription.","Sweater has ugly print as mentioned in other reviews but is very cute with fitted dark colored jeans and ballet flats.","The only thing that bothered me was the neckline (collar) was more chunky that I would have liked.","Fit was true to size, although if you want a looser fit, definitely plan to size up.","But overall, great rental."
"everyday","Would have given this beautiful dress 5 stars but the armholes are so large that its offensive!","I had to keep my arms pressed to my side at work to avoid side boob!","Better suited for a party vs. work."
"everyday","Waist is high - flare is perfect - very well made."
"everyday","I picked this out in store on a whim and ended up getting a lot of compliments.","Only thing to note is that its very lightweight and wouldnt be suitable for very cold weather."
"everyday","It fix to boxy, but a very nice sweater, very warm and excellent stitching and i liked the colors on me"
"everyday","This is a seriously fun sweater/sweatshirt.","The individual sequins are sparkly, not just shiny.","Mysteriously, the overall effect is a nice shimmer rather than the usual disco-ball effect of a sequined top.","And it was surprisingly comfortable.","The fit is typical for Equipment tops."
"everyday"," Wonder garment..neckline is low..may not be good for work or church..I threw on a sweater.fit and flare and extremely flattering."
"everyday","Not very soft, but I always wore something underneath, so it wasnt an issue.","Neck collar is very flattering and sophisticated looking.","I was worried I would look homeless, but not the case at all.","I literally wore it with everything it was so easy to throw on."
"everyday","This jacket was perfect.","It fit great and could be dressed up or down.","I was sad to return it."
"everyday","Style this dress up or down, great for a city chic sporty look with the mesh details.","I am quite petite in size, so the dress was a perfect length on me, but for taller people I would recommend the next size up."
"everyday","If youre short or short-waisted, this top is for you!","For me, though, it is not a good look.","Too short, and not in a cute way.","Kind of makes me look at least 5 months pregnant because of where the bottom of the blouse hits.","The quality, though, is A+++++.","I wish it were longer!"
"everyday","Simple but lovely little crop top.","The flowing bottom ruffle actual just covered my mid section, but if I lifted my arms,  skin would peek through on bottom portion.","Had I worn high waisted pants, this could have easily resolved the issue.","Top is very versatile and looks great with anything from jeans, to white shorts or pants.","High quality fabric, no wrinkling noted even after 4 hours."
"everyday","I got so many compliments on this dress!","It was a little on the short side on the sides so I wore it with black stockings for work and then took them off after for happy hour!","I loved this dress so much; it is going to be hard to part with it to send it back!"
"everyday","I loved this dress!","It does run a little big, so it was slightly boxy on me, but I wore it anyway because it was SO comfortable and still very cute.","Next time I would go with an XS.","Perfect dress for a daytime event or date!"
"everyday","This romper is super cute!","The fabric is light, perfect to be worn in a Summer day.","I used while spending a weekend in Boston and it was great for the entire day.","Three points to keep in mind, though: (1) it closes in the back, with three buttons, so there is absolutely NO WAY youll be able to do this yourself.","Youll need another person to close it for you.","(2) Youll need a friend to help you every time you go to the bathroom.","Theres a zipper in the shorts, but you have to be fairly flexible to pull it down without taking to top off.","(3) The elastic band is right in your waist, so it will emphasize if you have a slight bump below your bellybutton.","Other than that, I really liked it."
"everyday","loved the print and the style but unfortunately way to big.","Will try it again but in a smaller size"
"everyday","Great print!","With room in the arms, waist, and bust and no stretch to the fabric Id recommend ordering your true size.","Definitely on the longer side, this top looks great with pants or leggings for a more casual look.","Comfy and breezy, would love to own!"
"everyday","This fit is great for essentially any body type, and can be dressed up or down very easily.","The collar and wrist cuffs were lacier than I expected them to be, but it was a nice touch.","The sleeves stop just before the wrists, so may be shorter for those with long arms.","The length of the skirt is fine for both work and play, with a movable, comfortable material that is stretchy enough to be flexible while still hiding less flattering flab."
"everyday","I loved this top.","As a short-waisted person, I struggle to find crop tops that fit properly.","This top showed just the right amount of midriff without being inappropriate.","Great choice for petites."

"everyday","This top is gorgeous.","I ended up not being able to wear it because it was tight that I couldnt get it over my C cup bust.","I would recommend sizing up for any gals with a C cup or larger."
"everyday","This black dress is very flattering and comfortable.","The fabric is thick and warm.","I wore with booties and tights on a super cold NYC day and I wasnt cold.","If you want a more body-con style Id suggest ordering one size down."
"everyday","This sweater fits very true to size.","Its cropped so definitely pair with high waisted jeans.","I wore this to a friendsgiving in the city and received so many compliments.","The sleeves are intentionally long.","May need to roll up if you have a more petite frame.","Super warm and comfy.","Definitely recommend."

"everyday","Would definitely recommend"
"everyday","Ive tried on this dress in the store before and loved it, was so happy it was on RTR.","The teal color is beautiful for spring, cant wait to wear to work!"

"everyday","Perfect for the winter months!","Vest is so warm and fun.","Fit perfectly true to size with wiggle room for those thick sweaters."
"everyday","This fits very well and is flattering.","Even when I felt a little bloated it was a flattering cut.","I got compliments even from men.","It just has a very high quality look.","Something I would consider buying."
"everyday","The thing I liked about this dress is that it was not at all see-through which is hard to find in a white dress, and it was very comfy.","But I didnt really feel especially cute in it.","It doesnt have much style.","It just kind of hangs.","If you leave the front un-tied you will show a lot of cleavage, but if you tie the front up it pulls and bunches in the sleeves.","It doesnt really work for a professional outfit, even dressed up with a jacket and heals."
"everyday","I wore this dress while visiting my in-laws at their beach house for the weekend.","It was great for shopping, chasing the kids, and not looking like a mess.","It was pretty short on me, shorter than I usually wear.","Im 40 though, so I probably would have been more comfortable with the length a few years ago... and when I wasnt chasing kids and playing on the floor.","I loved being able to wear a regular bra, too.","And the sleeves were roomy.","I have large biceps, so thats a huge plus for me!"
"everyday","This is the perfect dress for someone taller!","It is adorable, lightweight, and polished!","I love that it provided coverage of my arms while showing a little shoulder!"

"everyday","Loved the fit.","Was able to throw it on and wear with sandals during the day, and dress up at night."
"everyday","Great for summer!","Dress it up or down for any occasion.","The fabric has a nice body con stretch making the dress comfortable, but larger busts may have to size up for comfort.","This runs true to size and i love the sheath shape and length for my height."
"everyday","I ended up wearing this dress a good bit.","It fit me thorough the bust, but overall the dress is big, and the sleeves were a tad long for me.","My man called it a Mu-Mu, but I felt pretty and comfortable in it and it kept me cool in the hot weather.","It is lined, so no see thrus.","I recommend it overall."
"everyday","I loved wearing this dress because of the pattern and flattering shape.","Although, I have to say the fabric feels a little bit cheap (super thin) and the dress is not lined.","The dress is very versatile; you can wear it to work, weekend, going out.","I wore it several times to all different types of occasions.","Definitely size-up because it runs super small."
"everyday","Fun pattern for the warmer weather, but as the other reviews say, this shirt really has no shape to it.","I wore it in the XS, but I dont think I would have liked the fit of this shirt even if I had the XXS.","Love the fabric, too bad it didnt fit well."
"everyday","This dress is very versatile!","It has kind of a sophisticated cheerleader vibe to it.","I wore it to work with a cardigan, and then for a date night with my husband.","It was very flattering, flirty and fun!"
"everyday","Skims the body nicely with a great drape to the shoulders."
"everyday","I really liked this combination.","It is two pieces.","The bottom is longer.","Other people complained that the bottom wrinkled, but I had it in a suitcase and wore it on a trip and had no issues with that.","I did not even have to iron it.","The top part was very comfortable.","On occasion the laces needed to be re tied but not often enough to bother me.","Paired it was dark skinny jeans and it looked very cute.","I probably could have paired it with leather leggings as well.","I would rent again."
"everyday","Bold print.","Easy to wear."
"everyday","This is a really warm, comfortable and casual sweater.","It was a good length for my 59 frame.","I wore it to work several times, and on weekends."
"everyday","The fit is perfect"
"everyday","Cut was great, but large.","Go down a size."
"everyday","Top is only okay.","Its comfortable to wear but the details were not as prominent in person as on the models photo.","Top would be appropriate for anything from a nice date to work to brunch, I just didnt feel it was special like most of the other rentals."
"everyday","Great, modern every day coat."
"everyday","I loved this dress, the detail is so much better in person!","A few people asked me if it was 2 separate pieces actually.","The only con is that it wrinkles super easily.","After sitting at work for a short time I was sort of a mess.","Which is such a bummer because I would rent this again and again!","Received lots of comments, and fit true to size."
"everyday","I wore this with sneakers and a denim jacket.","It was perfect."
"everyday","I love big, cozy sweaters for the fall and this one does not dissapoint.","It runs REALLY big.","For reference, I am a size 12-14 and rented a medium and I am swimming it.","I know thats the style but some people may not be into that so I figured Id let you know.","Quality is amazing and the pattern is adorable.","I love that the sleeves have the yellow print on it because it just makes it look special.","Highly recommend!"
"everyday","Tight in the bust for larger chested gals, I am going to size up next time and hoping it doesnt become too baggy.","Easy to wear!"
"everyday","Very fitted.","I wear a zero in tops and the XS was snug / the perfect fit (over just a T-shirt).","The jacket is comfortable and fairly flexible (there is some stretchy material under arms that gives some movement).","It looks trendy and expensive / high quality.","Will be keeping this one for a few weeks."
"everyday","Loved this piece.","Great color, flexible fit (it is a wrap dress on the bottom, so a great choice for ladies with hips and smaller waists, like me).","Love the coverage up top but still felt sexy in it.","Would definitely purchase."
"everyday","This skirt is everything.","Love, love, love.","It is pretty short though (Im 58) so I could only wear flats with it.","Still, I would have bought if it werent so expensive.","Definitely rent!"
"everyday","The color of this dress is gorgeous - a bright, saturated blue that makes you smile just too look at it.","Unfortunately I didnt end up wearing this because it was missing a button in a rather strategic place and Id rather not hand-patch rental items.","The fabric is comfortable and doesnt wrinkle easily, and the length perfect for everyday or work.","I am large chested and found that area a tad on the tight side, which was surprising with the extra give provided by the peek-a-boo hole in the back.","On the back hole - it was smaller than expected; more of a horizontal slit.","It was a nice addition, but would have made a bigger statement if it had a bit of a cowl effect or was more pronounced."
"everyday","I will have to wait a tad longer.","I am going to send these back and try for the 0.  a lot of material and not as snug as i was thinking the 2 would fit on me after reviewing all the customer reviews on fit.","i love the navy blue love the interest in the lines of the pant and look forward to putting together a great outfit once the 0 arrives."
"everyday","This is my favorite rental so far.","The style, fit and weight (fairly light) is perfect."
"everyday","Generally speaking, I love just about everything I put on by Kate Spade.","This dress was pretty adorable, but I personally didnt love the pattern; it looks amazing in the stock photo and the mid-section hits her just right, but it wasnt as pronounced when I wore it and I missed that!","Overall, still a great dress and it was my fiances favorite of the three dresses I rented this time around.",":)"
"everyday","Very forgiving and flattering fit.","I think I was the first person to wear it and it still had the retail tag on.","A little disappointed that RTR is billing this as a dress when the tag says its a beach coverup.","Oh, well it worked out!"
"formal affair","The only thing that bothered by about this dress was that the shoulders didnt stay on very well since the open back didnt have any way of keeping them in place.","It wasnt a huge deal to adjust it every once in a while, but other than that- I loved it!","MUCH more sparkly in person!","Photos make it look like it is not, but especially at night this dress sparkles when you walk.","Loved it."
"formal affair","This dress fit well and flattering to the figure.","Im 57 so the length was perfect on me.","What I loved most were the sleeves but I must admit getting a bra to fit perfectly was challenging since the bust line is slightly low.","Overall, great for the benefit dinner I attended."
"formal affair","This was my first time, and I look forward to my next event.","RTR went above and beyond my expectations!","The dress fit perfect.","True to size.","Absolutely Gorgeous & Glamorous!","!"
"formal affair","arms ran very small"
"formal affair","The wow factor is high on a dress this sparkly, but the cut and length made it feel fun, too.","The fit was good, but its a little roomier in the back than I expected.","While that made it comfortable, it also made for a little less flattering fit in the back than I would have liked.","The dress was also a little roomy in the chest, which is strange because Im a D or DD.","I would suggest going a size smaller if you have a smaller chest, youll have room elsewhere.","The zipper was sticky, too, and took some work to get started.","I would absolutely rent again - my 4 year old son cried when I had to send it back :)"
"formal affair","Lots of fabric and wasnt too tight in the bust."
"formal affair","Fit well.","Looks nice.","Lots of compliments."
"formal affair","(Reviewing for my friend, her measurements above) This dress is breathtaking.","The lace detail is dramatic without being Gothic looking, and the dress is sexy while still being covered up.","Boning in the midsection and stretch throughout makes for a perfect fit."
"formal affair","The fit was perfect in the sleeves, waist and length.","The only caveat was the slip underneath which was too big.","However, the netting concealed it perfectly.","I loved the dress and it was a huge success!","I highly recommend it for semi-formal and formal events.","Its perfect for the lady who wants to make a statement and turn heads."
"formal affair","Such a comfortable dress!","I loved the fabric and cut.","The pockets were deep enough for my phone.","I sat, stood, and danced and was never afraid of it falling out.","I only wore 2 inch heels.","It was just a little long, but I liked the effect when I was standing still.","I was very sad to send this dress back."
"formal affair","If anything, it was a little loose.","The back had some extra space, which wasnt a problem while wearing it, and I taped the front to avoid gaping because its pretty open.","I thought I had ordered a backup, sized up, but it never came so Im glad the 12 fit!","I would size down from your regular size as a backup."
"formal affair","I am normally a size 0, but the 2 fit perfect!","I sized up based on other reviews.","I wore this to a wedding rehearsal dinner and received many compliments!","It fit like a glove.","Would definitely recommend!"
"formal affair","This dress was true to size.","It stretched in all the right places and was very comfortable."
"formal affair","This dress fit great and was fun for a formal night out without being too fussy.","The navy color was gorgeous!"
"formal affair","Fit like a glove!","Im 54  130 lbs and I usually wear a 2 in dresses but ended up using the 4.","I did decide to order petite since most reviews said they wore 3-4 inch heels.","I wore cowgirl boots and if just touched the ground.","Lovely material, very comfy and I got nothing but compliments all night!"
"formal affair","Wore this gown to the WHCD!","It was perfect .. felt just glamorous enough.","Received a ton of compliments!","Fit like a glove, however I wish Id gotten the Long.","Im 58 so finding shoes that werent going to make it creep up was tricky.","I would 100% recommend it for a formal/ red carpet event!"
"formal affair","This jumper its statement, only annoying me a bit the top around arms the sequins fabric, if you are a busty , or chubby girl avoid this one."
"formal affair","Dress fit like a glove.","Hugged all my curves in all the right places!"
"formal affair","I rented this for a fun but formal work event and paired with a black blazer since the event was outdoors.","Fabric had great weight and structure so the origami style folds remained crisp and clean.","Color was brighter in person- which I loved!","Was very easy to move around in.","Unfortunately I was so busy for this event I didnt get a single photo."
"formal affair","The dress fit perfectly, even the length was perfect for my shoes!","I received so many compliments that night and was told over and over that I need to purchase the dress.","I was a little worried about being hot in the dress, but I was not hot at all!","It was very comfortable!","Will definitely be renting it again for my next event."
"formal affair","Fit was true to size.","Absolutely stunning dress.","Would definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","The length was perfect for me, Im 59 so the long was great.","The zipper can be a little subborn, so be sure you have some help on hand."
"formal affair","dress looked a little shabby and fit of fabric was not flattering.","had to do an emergency swap out unfortunately."
"formal affair","I wore my normal size and was able to wear a normal strapless bra with it.","I felt glamorous wearing it."
"formal affair","I love love love this dress!","The ruffles and the side slits give it just enough character to add some sass to a formal event."
"formal affair","Such a fabulously chic and unique gown!","I love the color and simple, yet unique tailoring.","Running true to size, we recommend sizing up for backup.","This gown is meant to have a slightly loose silhouette and shows off your back and leg with the side slit.","The bust has room, but you must go braless or wear a nubra with the low back.","The waist is loose and the hips are slightly fitted, so Id recommend sizing up if youre curvier.","With a slight stretch to the fabric, this style has some give.","Looks great with strappy heels and minimal jewelry.","Wore it to a black tie optional wedding and loved it!"
"formal affair","tight in the chest"
"formal affair","PERFECT dress for New Years Eve!","The fit was amazing and made me feel so glamorous and confident.","I got so many compliments!","if you need a dress for a birthday celebration or special night out this is it!"
"formal affair","The dress fit perfectly especially the length!","The back was one of my favorite details of the dress and I was able to wear a bra with it.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"formal affair","I was asked to attend a very formal event one week before it happened!","Needless to say I was extremely stressed.","I had never used rent the runway but decided to try it out.","Not only did I get the dress I wanted, but my anxiety of finding a dress in such a short amount of time was eliminated.","I loved reading the reviews and experiences everyone had.","I got sooooo many compliments about my dress!","It was sooo comfortable and I couldnt have been happier with my choice.","It is a little revealing in the top area so getting the double sided tape was necessary.","Other than that it was perfect for my magical evening :)"
"formal affair","This dress is just gorgeous!","The colors the fi,t everything screams glamour!","It is form fitting but comfortable and thick enough to hide my love handles.","I usually wear size 12 on evening gowns and the XL was perfect.","I have broad shoulders and narrow hips but thanks to the stretch of the material it fit perfectly!!","!"
"formal affair","Let me start by saying I ordered this dress because I was 16 weeks pregnant at the time.","So if you are looking for something bump friendly this is a good option.","I wore this with 3 inch heels and it was also the perfect length for my 54 height.","I have larger boobs now being pregnant so I did have to pin the top a little but that was no big deal.","I also loved that it had pockets.","I had plenty of compliments about looking good but not specifically on the dress.","This is a pretty dress and it worked just fine but I have loved others more.","Thats just my personal preference but overall a great dress."
"formal affair","The dress is very flattering, as it has rouching in all the right places.","Your curves will be accented.","I ordered the petite and the length worked great, even with smaller heel (Im 5 1).","I was comfortable all night long."
"formal affair","Gorgeous dress!","Very flattering and easy to wear.","The crocheted flowers are amazing.","The fabric does have some stretch to it, comfy.","The color is a gorgeous magenta pink.","The length was good for me, 55."
"formal affair","The fit and length of the dress was perfect!","It hugged all the right curves and was a huge standout!","I did not have to wear a bra with this dress because the material was thick, and kept everything in place!","The lace of this dress is beautiful as well, it makes the dress unique!","I was receiving compliments all night!","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!"
"formal affair","Lovely dress, loved how theres an elegant train that flows beautifully as you walk.","Runs rather tight and the straps were an awkward length for a small-busted girl like me, so they were slightly lifted above my shoulders.","Definitely get a size up from what you usually wear.","Otherwise, highly recommend!","Wore this to the opening night gala for SF Opera, so the reception and theater were full of extremely well-dressed people, but many women (and some men) came up to me to make a point of telling me how beautiful this dress was!"
"formal affair","Beautiful, attention-grabbing dress.","Lots of compliments and very comfortable to dance in.","The only thing I would say is that it might have even been TOO attention-grabbing.","It had a lower cut than I thought and I was hyper-aware of whether or not people could see my bra all night.","Overall a really great party dress though."
"formal affair","The dress is way better in person and pictures dont really do it justice.","Its perfect for a formal events.","Very comfortable, material is giving in all the right places, and the lace detail is just enough to catch everyones eye!","I received tons of compliments!","Only kicker is to be careful about the shoes you wear/tripping.","Im a bit clumsy and almost ate it a few times!",":) Otherwise Id definitely rent it again!"
"formal affair","Its really hard to describe how this dress fits.","The open back is very very loose but the bust is oddly tight.","The length is also a bit tricky to sort out.","Not my favorite RTR experience but not terrible."
"formal affair","The dress was stunning and an ABSOLUTE HIT!","I received compliments all evening on the unique design, elegance, and fit (and this was a very well-dressed crowd).","The waist is quite narrow, so consider going a size up."
"formal affair","I got this as my back up dress, and it was just slightly too short to wear since my shoes (I wore flats) werent anything special.","It would have been fine if I had wanted to show off my shoes, but it was probably a half inch off of the floor, and I like dresses to skim the ground.","Im typically a size 10, but this gown was only available in an 8 - it still fit, but it was on the tighter side.","Still very flattering!","The straps on the back didnt lay perfectly flat, but they didnt look awkward.","I went with the Monique Lhuillier Pomegranate Gown instead in a size 10, and it was perfect!"
"formal affair","The dress was fabulous.","I rented both the 12 and 14.","The 12 was a bit snug right in the armpit area but would have fit otherwise.","The 14 gave me that extra room and still looked great.","I received compliments all night long and on social media once I posted pictures.","It runs shorts for sure.","Im 55 and wore 3 1/2 heels and it was really a little shorter than I normally like.","It just barely brushed the top of my shoes.","The sequins were a little itchy and my hair kept sticking to them!","But, it was so gorgeous and I felt so great that it was worth it!","Id definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","The dress actually fit ok, I think my overall issue was with the length.","I am 56 and it barely hit my ankles so that just made it ill-fitting.","Material is great though, very breathable, especially nice in the summer time!","I would say though that the dress is definitely made for a curvy body, and someone that is full chested."
"formal affair","This dress was beautiful on.","The material is thick and stretchy.","It was February when I wore it, so I was warm in this dress.","it was very form-fitting.","I am tall, so I was worried about length.","It was a little short for my comfort, but I loved it so much that I didnt want to waste it.","I usually am a Medium but opted for the Large in this dress (thank goodness i ordered two sizes!).","The medium was just too small.","I received compliment after compliment and felt beautiful the whole evening."
"formal affair","I thought I would love this dress more than I did.","First, I would have preferred the long, but it was not available.","The dress came just to the top of my feet and I am 56.","I prefer a dress to cover my feet with shoes on.","And the materials is not as good of quality and I would have expected for this designer/price of this dress.","There was also not a lot of structure to the dress.","I am curvy and the back did not lay completely flat on my back and I had to adjust it rather frequently.","But overall, the dress was comfortable, looked good and served its purpose."
"formal affair","I am petite and liked that this dress worked for me length wise.","I received lots of compliments!"
"formal affair","It fit perfectly.","But I had to keep pulling the dress up due to the bust size (too large) but manageable.","The zipper was a bit difficult, but could still be used.","I wore this to prom and everyone loved it!"
"formal affair","This dress is absolutely amazing!","I had originally rented a different dress, but it didnt fit correctly.","One of the stylists recommended this dress and shipped it overnight, and I wish I had chosen this dress from the beginning!!!","It is form fitting at the top and a lines out towards the bottom.","The lace detail is beautiful!","I paired it with some blue heels for a pop, and I received compliments the entire day!","I definitely recommend this dress!!!","!"
"formal affair","Con- The skirt was a little stretched out for my liking, not a part of the actual dress, but just because it was worn  quite a bit.","The zipper is pretty hard to get up over the leather seam, takes some tugging and pulling.","Pros- Dress fit like glove.","The color came through the bodice on the black dress really well."
"formal affair","Haha!","Well my babysitter and I chose the same dress from Rent the Runway... it didnt bother me at ALL but it was something people kept coming up to me and telling me for the first 30 minutes.","We have VERY different body types and I think it looked great on both of us.","I was nervous about renting because it is hard for me to find formals that work for me.","I wear a size 36 DDD bra.","But I didnt even have to wear a bra with this dress!","It has boning and is SUPER flattering.","Lots of compliments from guests.","Had a BLAST in this dress!"
"formal affair","Fit perfectly, light  weight, flowing"
"formal affair","The fit was a true size 8, I have a pear shape so below the waist rules what fits and what does not.","The dress allows you to walk and dance.","I am 5-3 and had to add a 3 hem  which allowed me to walk without the gown dragging on the floor.","My heel was about 2... it was a long night.","Strapless bra is the way to go, but you cant clip the front (the clear clip shows).","Thinking about renting this again for a November fundraiser."
"formal affair","This dress was very tacky, I didnt like the sequins of the shape it gave me.","it was a back up dress and didnt wear it"
"formal affair","This was much larger than expected.","I really wish theyd had a 00 and a short length.","I wore super high heels so that helped with the length (although it still had quite a train).","If I owned it I would have had to have it tailored and an inch taken in on each side.","Sadly, my backup dress was also huge and less formal, so I stuck with this one."
"formal affair","I had very high hopes for this dress.","I had to got to a military formal with my husband.","I have a lot of tattoes & the event was in February so I wanted something long with long sleeves so i thought this dress would be it for me.","One good thing about this dress is that it does show off your curves.","Now for why I was disappointed.","1) Its a bit snug.","Majority of the time I wear a size 2.","I was forced to have PERFECT posture in this dress.","2) Its short!","If a dress is catagorized as floor length, it needs to be just that.","Im 53 & a half the 2R was floating above my ankles!","Good thing I ordered a 2L!","Even the 2L was too short for me.","I had to wear 2 inch heels, which I hate, & you could still see all of my shoes!","Before I ordered it, I chatted with a stylist & asked her opinion if I should get a regular or long.","she recommended that I get the regular.","Good thing I didnt listen to her!","If you want the dress to be an actual floor length & you are taller than 54, I strongly recommend getting the XL.3) The stitching was a bit awkward.","It was very itchy around the neck.","4) I didnt like the hem at the bottom.","It looked almost cheap.","I didnt have a choice but to wear it since you dont get it till the day before the event.","All in all, it was ok. Not completely satisfied.","Not sure if I will order from RTR again."
"formal affair","This dress was awesome.","It is super comfortable and very classy.","I felt covered, but beautiful.","As an Art Director, it was funky enough for me to feel like it was my style, but elegant enough to feel right at home at the black tie event I attended.","I loved this dress!","I would order a 10L next time around as the 8 was a little too tight and the 12 a little too loose."
"formal affair","Loved the back of this dress; compliments galore!","It was super comfortable and fun to dance in!","I would totally rent this again, although Id size down next time as this dress runs large."
"formal affair","This jumpsuit was amazing.","It was so comfortable and incredibly flattering.","And very easy to take on/off by yourself when going to the bathroom!","It did get a little warm in the legs by the end of the night - but it was so worth it.","I seriously considered not returning this to RTR!","I will definitely rent this again!"
"formal affair","This dress is flattering and very comfortable.","It stands out and doesnt require much accessorizing.","I wore the 4L but still found it a little short in heels.","Highly recommended overall."
"formal affair","Initially, I thought: what was I thinking?","It looks very dowdy online--with what appears to be an asymmetrical hem.","Its actually an even hemline.","The halter fastening at the neck is somewhat adjustable and theres an interior waist fastening that gives it a better fit.","The fabric is also more interesting than the website portrays.","Im 52 so it hit at lower calf in a flattering way.","Also pockets.","This was in 4th place going into the final and I ended up wearing it."
"formal affair","The fit was perfect, forgiving and very comfortable!"
"formal affair","This dress fit true to size and was flattering and comfortable.","Im 53 and the regular length was perfect with heels on.","It is a very formal dress and i ended up wearing another option because I felt it was too fancy for my event.","Would be perfect for a holiday formal.","Sleeves and neckline are very pretty and flattering."
"formal affair","Im a DD, and a size 8 was small on top but big on the bottom.","I would have taken a size 6 if the top hadnt been so tight.","Runs small on top and big on bottom."
"formal affair","I LOVED this dress.","Incredibly comfortable.","I ordered a 6 with a 4 being my backup.","The 6 fit fine, but the straps felt too long and I knew it would drive me crazy all night, plus it was a little looser than Id wanted.","The 4 was a little more snug, but hugged my body perfectly.","The straps were hardly an issue, though they did slip a few times when I was dancing.","I wore 3 inch heels and the length of the dress was perfect, just grazing the floor.","Really have no complaints, only that if you are going to an event on a hot day (as I did), the fabric is thicker than youd expect.","Also I wore spanx under my dress, and felt like I could see them through the lining at certain points.","All in all, I was really sad to return this one since Id love to have it in my closet.","HIGHLY recommend it for any formal affair or black tie optional event."
"formal affair","Fit great, true to my size.","A little bit longer than expected, but it worked well.","Covered my chest well, the sequins werent annoying or scratchy, which is normally how sequins are on clothing.","Overall just a beautiful and classy dress."
"formal affair","This dress was amazing.","The interesting part is that it isnt form-fitting around the waist, which usually makes me look dumpy, but everyone was saying how flattering it was on my curvy figure and someone even asked me if I had lost weight!","The short length made it just flirty enough for a work event - showing off legs - without being inappropriate.","The only snag with it, is that it did snag a few times on my rings, and on the button of a mans suit!"
"formal affair","The fit was perfect and it was very comfortable.","The material was flexible and hugged me in all the right places, making it appear that I had more curves than I really do have.","I did not need to wear a bra with it at all and had no worries about it slipping down around the bust.","My actual height is 57 1/2 and in reading some of the reviews I decided to order the long, which I do believe the regular length would have been fine because I had to pull it up a bit when I walked and danced, but it still looked as elegant as I had hoped.","The color popped and received many compliments."
"formal affair","My dad got the Kennedy Center Medal of Honor in DC and I wanted something sparkly to wear to the event.","This did the trick.","Everybody loved this dress.","Someone even thought I could double as the actual Oscar award I was so gold and shiny.","This dress is so comfortable and easy to wear I could have worn it to bed.","It wasnt as long as Id hoped so if youre over 510 even the L will be too short."
"formal affair","I ordered both the 10L and 12L for length, which fit perfectly.","Im 56 and needed the long with 4 heels - It would barely touch the floor in the front with a demi-train in the back.","I normally  wear a 12 because of my large chest and bottom, but the 12L fit was definitely roomy in all areas, especially in the midsection.","I would size down with this dress.","The material is thick with a silk lining but can show every bump, lump, lining of your shapewear or undergarments.","That was my only issue in this gown!","Otherwise, its absolutely gorgeous and timeless with a touch of elegance.","I had so many compliments on how this fit on me as an hourglass figure and it felt incredibly comfortable and beautiful on."
"formal affair","The fit was wonderful, I did not need spanx and had the ability to eat without worrying.","There are draping details that are hard to see, but I think it made my waist look smaller."
"formal affair","Flirty.","Fun & sexy... Love this one.","The flared out bottom of the dress makes it fun , yet it seems pretty short.","Im 53 so its just right in length but on anyone else whos taller might be too short.","Id rent this one again :)"
"formal affair","This dress is gorgeous.","I got it as a replacement for a dress that was unavailable b/c of damage, and its probably because I had my heart set on the first dress that I was underwhelmed.","The purple is an absolutely beautiful shade.","And the cut is gorgeous.","Its surprisingly stretchy.","I could almost completely take it off without unzipping the dress.","And I think because it is so stretchy that the cap sleeves have been stretched out a bit--they didnt fall off but they werent taunt either.","The buttons at the top are really hard to hook, even with the dress off, so if you dont have much shoulder strength/flexibility youll want someone to do them for you.","The hem was not remotely touching the ground, even in flats.","But I still wore 2 inch heels because it didnt look terrible--something about how the over-layer of lace sits just kind of makes it blend in so its not like theres a sharp hem line that makes the shortness super obvious."
"formal affair","the quality of the dress - both satin inside and the outside lace is superb"
"formal affair","Received so many compliments"
"formal affair","It fit well and accentuated my waist line.","Like other dressed Ive rented, it was tricky to get the zipper past the seam at the waistband.","Once you get over that seam, everything else works out well.","Only complaint is that by the end of the night, the underside of my arms were a bit scratched up from the sequins."
"formal affair","The off the shoulder look was unique yet classic.","I would rent this again.","The pop of red in the inside was subtle but very pretty."
"formal affair","Great fit.","The one shoulder cape gives it elegance and a unique flair.","Be careful of how you pose in photos though, due to the awkwardly large armhole under the arm of the cape.","Got compliments the entire night since the dress is so simple, yet unique as well.","It was a show-stopper at the ball!","Still trying to purchase this dress from the designer, since I fell so in love with it after renting it for the occasion."
"formal affair","Loved this dress!","Fit very comfortably!","Looks great in photographs with the light sparkles."
"formal affair","This was my first choice dress and, unfortunately, it wasnt available in my first pick size.","I tried my backup size (which was smaller), but could not zip it past my shoulder blades.","I have swimmers shoulders and this fabric has no give.","The dress had plenty of room for my lower curves, but was very narrow through the top/shoulders.","A shame as it really is beautiful and unique."
"formal affair","I ordered this dress in a 6 and a 8, as  my usual size is a 6.","The 8 was very tight... had to call customer service and have a 10 overnighted.","The 10 fit well, although I had to keep pulling the bottom of the dress down all night, as it kept riding up.","No problems with scratchiness from the sequins, and this dress is Gorgeous!","Hated to send it back!"
"formal affair","This was actually a back up dress to the dress I ordered, but it ended up fitting great.","I did order the 2 and 4 originally, but after reading reviews and seeing it ran large, I called rent the runway and switched to the 0 and 2.","Im so glad I did because I ended up wearing the 0.","I have an athletic build because I weight lift, so I would not normally wear a 0.","My typical size is 4."
"formal affair","This dress is elegant, easy to walk in, and comfortable!","The color is a striking blue and the lace detail on the back is so intricate and beautiful.","Im beyond happy with the dress and wonderful service.","I will without a doubt be renting from RTR again."
"formal affair","Runs a little short -"
"formal affair","I didnt love this dress.","I am very small-chested and the bodice was very tight, I usually wear a 2 in dresses fitted on top, Im bigger on bottom, but I didnt even try the 2 on after trying the 4.","What I didnt like was the way the body of the dress fits over the hips - it is fitted halfway down the thigh - and then the skirt comes out.","I felt like I was wearing an unflattering 1950s swimsuit with a little skirt tacked on.","Instead of drawing the eye to my small upper half, I felt like it drew the eye right to my heavier bottom half - not the look I was going for."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for my senior prom and I absolutely loved it!","I got a million compliments and didnt have a single issue with it.","Renting it was so smart because when will I ever need to wear my prom dress again?","(even though I hated returning it because I loved it so much).","Will definitely rent from Rent the Runway again!"
"formal affair","True to size!","Great dress for a formal event."
"formal affair","Dress fit great!","It is short, but was perfect on my 54 frame.","Bust area is adjustable by tightening/loosening the bow in the back.","The material is also thick and high quality."
"formal affair","I loved the details of this dress!","Its definitely more cute than sexy, but I got a lot of compliments.","Would probably look more flattering on someone with bigger boobs, but it still fit my little ones just right!"
"formal affair","I had this dress ship to a hotel I was going to stay at, it arrived a day earlier so RTR guaranteed that I would get the dress in time.","This dress is definitely more wine color than red.","If youre looking for a specific red dress, just be aware.","The fit is okay, Im a 12, and I was to put on this dress in 12, but its very tight.","I still wore it to the dinner because I liked the sleeves a lot, they are flattery.","The fabric is fairly thin, but not easy to wrinkle, thats definitely a plus.","You definitely want to order one size up for the look thats shown on the model.","I probably wont order this particular dress again, but RTR is awesome!"
"formal affair","True to size.","Perfect for pear shape!"
"formal affair","Perfect fit!"
"formal affair","My original dress I wanted to wear was delayed so I had to pick back ups.","This was one of them that I chose.","I am glad I did!","If you cant find another dress this dress is sure to look great and be perfect for the occasion.","I probably could have gone with a long but would have had to wear 3+ heal and I am not one for tall heals so this one was perfect."
"formal affair","This is THE dress.","Want to look and feel like a million bucks?","This is the one.","Form fitting and flattering - my girls and booty looked awesome while my less than flat belly was hidden.","I am 54 and wore two inch heels - which were perfect.","I think taller heels would have made the dress look too short, so be aware.","I cannot even begin to express how much I loved this dress!","The only complaint was that the hanger loops kept coming out all night.","Tape those down and youll love it!"
"formal affair","I ordered a size 2 and 4 for backup, the dress was beautiful in person and the fabric was very forgiving, but the top was just weird.","I honestly could have fit in a 0 or even 00 (f they made that) because while the bottom flared out nicely, the top was so big that I had to stuff my bra with cutlets and tissue paper to fill it out and it was still loose in the rib cage area.","Like other reviewers, the top half is cut uniquely under the arms but this makes for a very interesting challenge when choosing a bra to wear.","I ended up not wearing it to my event because it was just too strange a fit for me.","Definitely size down in this dress and probably would have worn it if I did."
"formal affair","The color of this dress is stunning, but it was too long for me (even with 3 heels) and felt a bit bridesmaid-y.","That said, it will cover any problem areas you may have and the fabric ships well (not too wrinkly).","I dont have a particularly large chest, but do have a broader back, and this fit well up top."
"formal affair","Overall the dress is gorgeous, simple and elegant.","I am 56 and about 140 lbs and had to wear a size 12 because the dress is super fitted and does run pretty small.","I ended up not wearing this dress because this was a back-up Id ordered in case the other one didnt pan out, but it was a close call, I literally flipped a coin haha.","Would highly recommend this dress :)"
"formal affair","I just wore this dress to a wonderful charity event and was stopped by men and women who commented on this fabulous dress.","I was a walking ad for RTR that evening and spread the word.","There were over 1200 attendees.","The other two dresses I ordered were equally terrific; however, there was a band with a great light show and dancing, so the sparkles won out.","LOVED IT!","Also, the return was so easy.","Thank you!!","A new customer!"
"formal affair","I got compliments and it was comfortable all night.","Its definitely not flashy."
"formal affair","The fit was pretty good but Im a bit smaller in the bust and there was the usual constant pulling up that you get with a strapless dress.","On the bright side, judging by my boyfriends face when he picked me up he really liked it."
"formal affair","This dress fits like a glove...no bra required.","Looks fabulous on and received many compliments!","Very elegant with a hint of sexy.","It did have an odd smell out of the box but it gradually faded."
"formal affair","The fit was true to size.","The length was perfect for a mid-heal (1 am 56 and I wore 2.5inch heal) so keep this in mind if you are a bit taller or if you want to where 4 inch heals.","The top button in the back was a bit loose so just make sure you have someone button properly for you."
"formal affair","This dress fit like a glove and was sooo comfortable!","It didnt have a zipper and just slipped right on over my head.","Was comfortable for the whole night, easy to dance it, and I felt good in it!"
"formal affair","This dress is gorgeous.","The colors and pattern truly make it a stand-out.","I got multiple compliments throughout the evening.","The fit was pretty good for the most part--if it were a dress I owned, I would have tailored the top just a bit more.","The pockets were fun and practical (my phone fit perfectly).","So glad I tried RTR for the first time.","I will definitely be back."
"formal affair","It fit like a glove, and I got stares all night.","I actually thought that I was going to need the 14L but I didnt.","I wore 2-3 inch heels and yes, the dress went to the top of my ankle.","I did actually want it longer, to lay to the top of my toes, but it wasnt anything that I thought about, or was insecure about.","My body looked great in the dress!","I have a post baby pooch and you never saw it in the dress, and with photos it was easy to show off the back instead of the front anyway (which was the talking piece)!","I was full of fashion, and sparkling eyes all across the room."
"formal affair","Great fit and ran true to size.","Also super comfortable!!","I got a lot of complements, no complaints with this dress other than it was a little long!"
"formal affair","The skirt has built-in but flexible-but-cardboard-like material to keep the skirt in shape, which I like at the beginning of the day.","As the day goes by, it get distorted after I sit on it."
"formal affair","I loved this dress and received compliment after compliment all night.","Ive been wearing more of an 8 lately, but the 6R fit perfectly.","It was long on me (Im 55), but 4 platforms did the trick.The flowy fabric and gorgeous rich green color were simply beautiful.","And the return was ridiculously easy.","It was my first experience with RTR, and Ive already rented for another event coming up."
"formal affair","Fit like a glove.","Quite comfortable.","Holds you in.","Pretty low cut/creates cleavage.","Loved the cap sleeve.","Very classy and glam"
"formal affair","Thankful that I ordered 2 sizes smaller than my normal size as by backup size.","I am 56, 135 pounds, and wore a size 4 for the first time in 3 years.","Do not order big on this one!","Overall the dress fit really well and I got tons of compliments on it.","I did use tape under the dress just to keep it in place all night."
"formal affair","This dress is amazing.","Its sexy in all the right places, while also being comfortable.","I was able to wear a regular bra, as well, which was a huge plus.","I got many compliments from both men and women and I felt extremely special at an event I needed to be at.","I am thinking about renting it again for a wedding I will be attending in August."
"formal affair","Great, great, great dress!","The fabric is just lovely.","It is comfortable!","And everyone adored the dress.","If you are going to wear Spanx or tummy control, do know the inset is sheer, so they cant be too high-rise.","I wish the neckline had a slightly neater finish to it.","I opted not to wear a necklace and wish I had.","So dont hesitate to try a collar-style necklace.","I felt like a million dollars, and was so happy I had rented from RTR when I saw the major investment some of the other ladies made in serious statement dresses, which everyone will remember the next time they have to wear them!"
"formal affair","Dress was really long - I couldnt wear it.","Color and style was beautiful though."
"formal affair","It was not form fitting-loose on my waist, but very elegant."
"formal affair","Im a high school teacher who got roped into chaperoning prom this year.","To be sure that I didnt stand out but also didnt look frumpy, I decided to rent the runway.","Im so glad I did!","The dress fit perfectly...except for the sleeves.","I saw the reviews before renting, but I decided the dress was too perfect.","The sleeves were pretty tight, but I made it through the night just fine."
"formal affair","Very flattering formal dress, but waist runs very tight (with a few weak fastening).","Skirt is very full and keeps it shape during a long night..."
"formal affair","Fit right, great dress."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a black tie medical society gala.","I needed a dress that was formal, sexy, classy, without being too tight or too revealing; all this while still being appropriate for the venue I was attending.","I never thought Id find the right dress.","This dress was PERFECT!","I usually wear a 2, however the size was not available so I ordered a 4L and Im glad I did.","Im 55 and weigh 118# and the 4 fit like a glove.","I got the 4L after reading some of the other reviews on the length.","I wore 3 heels and the dress just touched the ground, but did not puddle at my feet.","When I walked, the tips of my shoes were visible.","I got tons of compliments on this dress.","I will definitely rent more dresses from RTR in the future!"
"formal affair","The fit is super flattering and I got compliments all night.","I felt really comfortable in the dress.","The only downside was that the sequins were a little rough on the soft underside of my upper arms."
"formal affair","The top was a little large, I had some side boob action other than that I loved the dress."
"formal affair","Fit was true to size.","It was very lightweight & covered everything so I didnt have to be self conscious all evening.","All the detail made it the perfect dress because it didnt wrinkle easily.","I ordered the long & even with a wedge shoe, the dress still touched the ground.","I would recommend a regular size if you plan on wearing flats.","Super comfortable & I loved it!"
"formal affair","I am 5 feet tall so was a bit nervous about the length.","I wore 4 1/2 inch shoes and that ended up working well.","Since I am smaller, there was a little extra room through the top so a size 0 would have worked better for me.","I will rent this one again."
"formal affair","Very flattering around the waist and back.","It was comfortable and easy to dance in.","I recommend this for any formal event or holiday party!"
"formal affair","I rented this for my bridal shower.","I loved that it was white but not only white.. the color pop was perfectly feminine.","I received compliment after compliment on this dress.","The quality was amazing and it was very comfortable.","It was a little big on top for me but I tend to be smaller on top.","I highly recommend this dress!"
"formal affair","This dress fit perfectly!","The only reason it doesnt receive a 5 star for me is that the sleeves make it hard to move too much and the boning in the side some times poked me.","I normally wear a Size 2 (54, 32D, 26in Waist) and this dress was very true to size.","I was still able to wear a strapless bra for support and didnt have to worry about the dress dropping down throughout the night.","I wore low <2in heels but would recommend 3 or higher to avoid dragging the dress at all."
"formal affair","Dress was damaged and it wouldnt have fit anyways.","I would have needed to go up two sizes to fit comfortably.","Will try again because the color is beautiful as well as the material."
"formal affair","I originally wanted this dress in the royal blue color however it wasnt available.","I was unsure about the length since serveral comments mentioned that it was often too long.","The regular length was was perfect, I am 56 and wore 2 inch heels and would have been fine with taller heels.","The way the dress fell was very flattering, it made my waist look small.","It was a little tight around the waist area but it wasnt uncomfortable.","Everyone commented that they loved this dress.","Another girl at this event was also wearing this dress so just be careful.","I would love to rent this dress again."
"formal affair","The zipper was definitely an issue, as mentioned by others.","The dress is low cut so be aware of that when planning undergarments.","It was a lovely dress with sizzle and style, would definitely run this again."
"formal affair","Very elegant, might get it another time when the 6-8 is available."
"formal affair","This dress was amazing and I got so many compliments on it.","If youre one person for glitz and sparkles, this is definitely the dress for you.","I would recommend getting a larger size than you actually are because the zipper is tough to close around the waist.","Other than the zipper, I could not have asked for a more perfect prom dress to complete my perfect night."
"formal affair","I really like the color.","Stands out in the sea of black dresses.","I bit small in the top if you are busty but a great look overall."
"formal affair","This dress was beyond PERFECTION for my event.","It hugged my curves just right.","The flow of the dress when I walked made me feel like I was gliding on air.","There were so many compliments on the dress that my cheeks hurt from smiling.","I was more than thrilled to wear this dress.","The color was the perfect shade of Royal Blue that I had been searching for.","To simply put it.. the dress was AMAZING."
"formal affair","Dont need a bra when wearing this dress, because its relatively supported.","Was a bit long for me so I wore very high wedges and was able to dance all night.","No cons - the perfect dress for this time of event."
"formal affair","Fit very well - nice color dark blue but a nice change from black.","flattering fit, nice drape and hangs well.","Tons of compliments"
"formal affair","This dress was my backup and the only reason I didnt wear it was because I went with my first choice (also, please forgive the unmade bed in the background, this was the only pic I had and thought it was more helpful to see the dress on a person).","I typically dont go with longer lengths, but if you are tall & plan on wearing heels (3 for example) then I recommend the long length, it hit at just the right place.","The plunging neckline is revealing, but I am a 34B and didnt feel self-conscience.","This dress is beautiful and perfect for a black tie event."
"formal affair","The fabric is stretchy and very forgiving.","Loved the high n"
"formal affair","I absolutely loved this dress!!","It was perfect for my event, so elegant and classy.","Its was tight and stretchy in all the right places.","I might have fit into a size 4 with a little more room to breathe, but it was unavailable at the time I needed it, and the 2 did just fine.","The bust had a built in liner/bra that was a little tight so I went without a bra, but with the 4 I mightve had room for a strapless bra to give me a boost lol With 34Bs I usually need a bra to help fill out the tops of dresses, but this dress felt great without one.","Im also glad I opted for the Long, because I think the Reg might have been too short.","The dress does have a slight train, but the front hit the floor perfectly with 3-1/2 inch heels.","This was my first RTR experience, so I was nervous, but when I put this dress on, I knew I made the right choice!","I got so many complements and I felt like Princess Kate in this dress.","If I could give it 6 stars, I would!"
"formal affair","I got this dress because there was an issue to my backup size for another dress i ordered.","This dress was a really great choice.","Different from anyone elses dress and can easily be dressed up or down.","I wore with black strappy heels.","The only thing was it was a little long for me.","I dont like super short dresses but this ended up basically at my knees which was fine but wouldve prob looked cuter wearing a size 2."
"formal affair","It fit very well and was very flattering.","I was worried it was going to be too long, but it ended up being the perfect length.","I highly recommend it!"
"formal affair","There is no stretch to the dress.","It fit like glove and definitely kept my posture in check even after dinner.","This works for a professional event--just use your dinner napkin strategically when seated."
"formal affair","I really felt special for the event I attended.","I needed accoutrements to fill out the bust, but in the end it all worked out.","So many people came up to me asking where I got the dress and how much they loved it.","A few even said they would have voted me Best Dressed!","Thanks RTR!"
"formal affair","The dress fit beautifully from head to toe.","Because Im so short, it wasnt a mini dress but was still short enough that it didnt require any hemming.","The sleeves were a fantastic detail that transformed it from a simple black sheath to a fun party dress.","Would definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","This dress was my last minute choice that RTR overnighted to me (thank you thank you thank you!!)","when my original picks fit me horribly and the only one that worked was unfortunately damaged.","I am typically between a 16/18 and it can swing either way depending on the brand.","Based other reviews, I sized up and it fit perfectly.","It was a little long, but once I put on 3.75 heels, it grazed the floor beautifully.","As other reviews do mention, the waistband is a little snug, but not uncomfortable.","I actually liked the snugness as it forced me to have better posture all night.","I got so many compliments through out the night (especially since I was the only lady in the room in the stunning red), Im so glad I ended up wearing this dress!","Definitely loved!"
"formal affair","I ended up wearing my back-up dress instead of this one.","The dress was OK, but I felt like it lacked the wow factor - especially on a dark dance floor, the lace detailing wouldnt be visible, and it would look like any other long black dress.","Unfortunately it was also missing the belt, which is sort of key to giving it any shape.","If youre looking for a slightly more conservative formal gown, this might work well."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a formal gala event and received compliments on it all night long.","Im 59 1/2 and figured the dress would be too short or too tight, but the 10L worked perfectly.","It actually left me with a little bit of wiggle room in the bust area which was nice for dancing, but wasnt so loose that it was falling down.","I wore 3 1/2 inch heels and this ended up working out well.","I didnt feel like I was going to trip and fall over the gown throughout the night.","Would recommend this dress for any formal event!"
"formal affair","So comfortable but I probably did not need the long and I am 57.","No zippers it just hugs every where.","I got a zillion compliments.","It a head turner."
"formal affair","The dress fits true to size and has a lot of support with the larger straps.","One word from the wise for those of us gals who are well endowed, make sure you get a bra that works for the dress.","The straps on the back and low waist make it tricky.","I got a backless/strapless but had to reinforce for the night with tape ala Kim K."
"formal affair","Beautiful dress!","Fitted in the top, but gives a wonderful waistline for boxy frame.","I am 6 ft tall and the length was great (not quite to the floor with 3 in heels)."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a Corporate Anniversary Casino Night in the city.","The dress was simply and elegant with this overlay of silver shimmer.","It photographs great and the backless aspect makes it so sexy!","I was really worried being Im a 34DD and not wearing a bra, but the dress is nicely lined and it was not an issue at all.","Cant wait to rent it again!"
"formal affair","I looked and felt like a million bucks in this dress.","I also rented the Gorjana AccessoriesMika Lariat Set, which set off the low, low neckline very well, and the Alexis BittarCrystal Encrusted Spike Earrings, which matched nicely without being overstated.","I added low-heeled lavender-and-silver pumps, colorful smoky eye makeup, and taupe/nude lips.","The fabric is really gorgeous, hard to photograph in a way that shows off its rich beauty.","It was comfortable to wear, though putting it and taking it off required assistance (theres a zip for the upper back and then another one for the skirt to accommodate the open back).","The generously-sized pockets mean you dont need a clutch, which was perfect for drinking and dancing.","Warning: You will ~not~ be able to wear any kind of bra with it.","The open back and low-dipping V neck mean that anything between your breasts or on your back will show.","Because my breasts are not small or perky, I ended up using sticky bra cups to protect my nipples, then taping my breasts up to my shoulders using gaffer tape so that I had good lift (there are tutorials online for how to do this)."
"formal affair","#gala #blacktieoptional"
"formal affair","It fit well at the top.","I didnt need to wear a bra because of the boning in the dress, but I did have to pin the bottom up because it was a bit too long.","Otherwise, it wore well and I felt very pretty in it."
"formal affair","This dress was absolutely amazing!","I was reluctant to wear a long dress to an outdoor formal event in the summer because I worried that Id be too hot; however, this dress was surprisingly cool and comfortable.","I ordered this dress in a OP and a 2P - the 0P was a bit tight around my ribcage and the 2P was perfect.","I am   52 and I found the dress to be a bit long with a 2 heel, so I would recommend a higher heel if you are on the very petite side.","I wore a racer back bra and it worked perfectly.","The color was absolutely gorgeous and definitely stood out among all of the typical black dresses that you see at a formal affair.","I would absolutely rent this dress again and am very pleased with my RTR experience."
"formal affair","This dress is so gorgeous.","The only issue I had were the slits came so high up the thigh I was unable to wear the spanx I purchased for the event, but it turned out that I didnt really need the spanx."
"formal affair","It fit perfect!","I have rather large boobs and it fit amazing up top."
"formal affair","I got so many compliments for this dress!!","It was super comfortable and easy to dance in."
"formal affair","The fit is spot on.","Im curvy and this had plenty of room for hips, even being a sheath dress.","The back details are sexy and the front neckline is super sexy, but appropriate.","Loved this dress, would highly recommend."
"formal affair","The arms were a bit tight.","the dress itself was comfortable and fit well.","However, the band from the arms was too uncomfortable.","The back looked amazing!"
"formal affair","This dress has real drama.","The full, crinoline-lined skirt made me feel like a queen."
"formal affair","loved it"
"formal affair","The fit is perfect, everything about this dress fit well.","The neckline is super flattering.","I didnt wear a bra with it and I dont think you would need to."
"formal affair","Ive ordered a few dresses Ive really liked from RTR, but this one has taken the lead as my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.","It may look like a fairly simple black ball gown, but once you put it on your realize it is anything but.","The fabric is heavy, and perfect for a snow filled night.","I wore this to a black tie affair, and even in the midst of a sea of black dresses this one stood out, from the pockets to the adorable back detail.","It took a couple of pulls to zip up, but I was braless and comfortable all night.","Definitely, a must rent."
"formal affair","Loved it!","It was slender but not constricting.","I got so many compliments on it"
"formal affair","I loved wearing this dress.","It didnt photograph as well as some other dresses Ive rented and tried, but it looked spectacular in person.","the length is great, especially in these winter months, but the sheer fabric gives it a little sex appeal.","I wore the 6, because it fit me better on top, it was a little tight, but I liked it better.","Im usually between a 6 and a 10 depending on the designer and style"
"formal affair","I felt this ran true to size to slightly small.","I usually wear a size 2 and size up or down, pending reviews.","My second size was 0 and it was too small.","I have a very small chest and had a little difficulty filling this out properly, but using a stick on bra was very helpful.","I still received compliments all night."
"formal affair","I ordered both the 6R and 4R.","Both fit well, but the 4 just looked more flattering.","I loved this dress, it hugged in all the right spots and was perfect for a black tie affair.","It didnt fall down much, travelled well.","All in all a perfect dress for a formal night out!"
"formal affair","Unfortunately, had to return this without wearing it.","A few things I didnt see covered in other reviews caused my disappointment.","First, it is quite heavy, as it is covered in sequins, and doesnt have a slit in the leg to help make walking easier.","That was a concern.","Also, the fabric gathering in the front at waist is too much.","Would be perfect for a pregnant person or someone who wants to hide stomach.","Doesnt slim profile at all.","I didnt like the way it looked on me, so I returned it for credit.","Also, others said it runs large, but I dont agree.","Seems true to size."
"formal affair","I rented this for Valentines Day.","The color and style are gorgeous.","Please note that the sleeves on this outfit are a tight fit.","So if you are a bit more on the plus side like myself, opt for a large."
"formal affair","This dress fit beautifully and was insanely comfortable.","I felt great!"
"formal affair","I wore it for a Gala in Anchorage.","It fit true to size and was really comfortable to walk around in all night.","It was a little tight on the legs when i was sitting but it was not unmanageable.","The long sleeves were the perfect length and did not get to hot in a room with 700 people.","I loved it!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress!","It fit perfectly and the material was very nice.","I went a size up than what I normally do since its a little snug around the hips but is super flattering.","I did not feel self conscious once all night.","I received tons of compliments.","I have a smaller bust and wider hips and I felt this fit perfectly.","If anything a little room in the boob area but I wore a little extra padded bra.","I went with the R instead of the L since my heels werent super high.","If I wore higher heels it mightve been too short.","Overall I LOVED this.","It was really hard to give it back!"
"formal affair","This dress made me feel like a million bucks.","I wore it to a small family charity event (thats my best friends son in the photo with me).","At first, I thought it was just too big.","I wished I had ordered the 8P.","On top of that there was no way for me to wear a bra under this dress.","I dont think Ive gone braless out of the house in 20 years.","But I didnt have an alternative.","I decided that I felt secure in this dress since my chest wasnt revealed and the structure of the dress framed it well.","In the end, it was a huge hit and a very comfortable dress.","Im sure I could have got into the 8 but was better off with the body skimming 10.","Loved the red."
"formal affair","I ordered a 10 and 12 (was told designer dresses run a bit small) but the 12 was too big...the 10 allowed for a little movement around the midriff and hips.","The length was perfect with approximately 3 heels...swept the ground as I walked...loved it.","It was very comfortable with the exception of the sequence that rubbed against under arm.","It was fine the beginning of the night but by the end my skin was a bit irritated.","BUT, I would definitely wear it again!","!"
"formal affair","Length wouldve been perfect with a heel but I wore flats so it was a little long.","The shape was very flattering, flowy and glamorous!"
"formal affair","I ran into someone at the event wearing the same dress..LOL.","I guess we share the same great taste.","If you happen to see this comment, I just wanna say: We both look great in that dress.","I regret that we didnt take a selfie"
"formal affair","I loved this dress for an Old Hollywood themed formal.","I got lots of complements on this one.","It was very comfortable, and I didnt have to wear a bra with it.","My only complaint is that the draping on the sides made me look wider in the hips than I actually am.","Regardless, its a great dress that Id rent again."
"formal affair","The armpits didnt fit well at all so I had to  worry about them all night.","Very form fitting."
"formal affair","The dress fit like a glove, no complaints.","Its extremely flattering!","Im 58 and I ordered an 8R because I didnt want to wear heels--the dress was the perfect length, I wore embellished sandals with a 1cm wedge and the dress hit the floor perfectly.","The bottom half of the dress was definitely a little looser than I had expected it to be, but no big deal."
"formal affair","I was very worried that this dress was going to be too long as it was a regular length and I am pretty short!","But it was the perfect length with my 3-4 heels!"
"formal affair","Im 52 and the length was perfect with 3 heels.","The dress was even prettier in person than the photos did it justice.","There was enough support in the chest that I didnt have to wear a bra - which is a rarity for me!"
"formal affair","I wore this beautiful, purple gown for my sorority formal and I got so many compliments.","This dress is actually darker and less purple in person but it looks so beautiful on!","Im 59 and I wore 2 heels and the dress was still long, but it had pockets and it was tight enough on top so my boobs wouldnt fall out!","I would wear this dress again in a heartbeat!"
"formal affair","I actually received this dress because the one I originally chose was unavailable.","I dont think I would  have picked this for  myself, just because I  dont like gold, but I did love it.","The dress is well-made and fit  as expected.","The bust was a  little on the big side for me (possibly just from being worn several times, a little stretched out maybe) and I wear a 36C/D.","I did not need to wear a bra with it,  though a bra would have given the bust more oomph.","The dress was easy to move around in and dance in.","The lace was very glam without being overdone.","And itsvery comfortable!","The only issue I had was my heals kept getting caught in the little bit of a train.","I received many compliments on the dress and  I would definitely wear it again!","Kudos to the stylist that picked it for me!"
"formal affair","The dress was a perfect fit, it had a great stretch and feel to it.","It didnt show too much cleavage, it hugged my figure perfectly.","I definitely could not wear any underwear with this and the neck part felt great.","I would say this fit true to size and Im petite, so the 2R fell just right with my heels.","I could move around just fine without feeling like I was going to rip the dress.","Perfect dress!"
"formal affair","Dress is amazing.","RTR is also amazing and so easy to work with.","Dress and accessories arrived on time and in perfect condition.","I ordered the size 4 and 6.","Size 4 fit perfectly.","Dress is short but that is the fun of it.","Received several compliments on the dress and it was extremely comfortable.","I wore it for the black tie event and an after party.","Enjoyed every moment with this dress.","I wore no bra since its backless and had no issues.","I have a small bust and can get away without wearing a bra most of the time.","I rented the suggested earrings, dangle bracelets and clutch from RTR.","Loved the whole RTR experience.","Will use them again for future dress up events."
"formal affair","I felt like the bell of the ball in this dress!","I rented it for a formal wedding and it was perfect.","The color is bright and really stands out, but in a good way.","I received tons of compliments all night long.","Full bigger busted ladies (Im a 38 full D almost DD) the top is snug.","For me this was a plus, as I got away with not having to wear a strapless bra (which never stay in place anyway!).","The band around the waist is a bit snug as well, but nothing you dont get used to after a few minutes.","It hits high enough that it is not uncomfortable to sit or bend over.","I paired with white Kendra Scott earrings and light gold shoes.","Really wish I owned this one!"
"formal affair","Even though I love this dress so much, I do recommend getting one size bigger because in the fitted area that part gets very tight and almost impossible to zip.","But honestly everything else was perfect on this dress!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress!","The fit is amazing and the fabric is stretchy, making it a really comfortable, form-fitting dress.","The black lace was perfect for a formal fundraising gala, and I received so many compliments.","I wore a regular dress with 3 heels and the dress just barely grazed the floor.","I was also able to wear a regular bra with the dress, which was a plus.","I did not want to return this dress!","!"
"formal affair","This dress fit beautifully.","It was the perfect length (I ordered based on the recommendations for tall), and it was SO comfortable.","Also, the pockets were a dream come true.","I received many compliments, and danced the night away :) Thanks RTR!"
"formal affair","Beautiful details and flattering shape.","I am 51 and I think it was a perfect length for a formal affair.","My only complaint is that the sleeves fell down on me a few times."
"formal affair","Great dress!!","Wore this for my prom and got so many compliments.","The color made me stand out and complimented my tan skin.","The slits on the bottom and the lace back also made it a lot more sexier but at the same time didnt show too much.","LOVED IT"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a black tie wedding on NYE.","The fit was amazing - definitely true to size.","I did not need to wear a bra.","I ordered the long and it went perfectly with my 3in heels.","(Im 57) The fabric and length make it feel very formal, but the open back was a major wow factor.","I received more compliments on this dress than I have before in my life!","This is the PERFECT dress for a formal affair!"
"formal affair","I normally wear a 2, but I didnt need to wear a bra with this dress, so it fit (hence my choosing true to size).","The color was more teal-ish than green, but it was still beautiful!","Also, it was really long, even with 4 inch heels.","Overall, those were minor problems and the dress was amazing!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a holiday party and received several compliments.","The fit was perfect for me.","Im a pear-shaped and the style of this dress worked very well with my shape."
"formal affair","The dress was even more beautiful in person!","It fit like a glove and was comfortable - an added plus!","The neckline was stunning and can be worn by any size bust.","The back was beautiful making the dress stand out whether I was coming or going!","The dress had a timeless feel that made me feel elegant all night."
"formal affair","It fight like it was made for me.","The length was perfect and I always have trouble because I am so short.","The top was very tight but it looked great.","It had an easy zipper and it can be worn to any event really.","I 100% recommend this to anyone who is down to make a statement!","I did not want to send it back!"
"formal affair","Fit perfectly!","Maybe a little long (Im 57) but if you had high enough heels it would be perfect."
"formal affair","This is my first time using Rent the Runway, and it was so convenient!","The dress arrived on time, and I actually liked the fit better than when I saw it online.","It was truly a Cinderella experience.","The dress is a bit long, so if I had to do it over again I would get it in a regular instead of a long."
"formal affair","I loved how this dress hugged my curves and showed off just the right amount of skin.","I am 57 and around 125 pounds and both the 2R and 4R fit me well.","I went with the 2R because it hugged my curves nicer but both would have worked.","I highly recommend this dress for a formal occasion."
"formal affair","I forget that formal dresses arent stretchy, like most everything else I own and wear, so this dress was a little snug and unforgiving in the chest.","It kept me sitting up straight all night long.","Standing, it was a perfect fit, elegant and regal.","As I walked, the layers sashayed.","It made me feel absolutely gorgeous."
"formal affair","This looked and felt more like a night gown that a dress for a formal... it was very thin, and despite it being too big, you could still see the bra and panty lines."
"formal affair","I am 58 and the dress came above my ankles without shoes.","I ordered an 8L and it was still way too short.","Otherwise it fit like a glove.","I was sad not to be able to wear it."
"formal affair","Fits true to size and is simple and elegant.","Great choice for a formal event!"
"formal affair","Beautiful dress!","Great choice for black tie event- or formal wedding."
"formal affair","Dress is very high-waisted which is not my best look.","The sequins under the arms were a bit irritating to me.","I received many compliments but to me it was just ok. Price is great for the quality of the dress."
"formal affair","Dress fit perfectly.","I was conscience of the thigh level riding up, but it wasnt a problem per say.","Nice fabric and a great cut.","Received compliments all around."
"formal affair","I wore this to a black tie fundraising event and loved it.","It was comfortable and I really appreciated that I could wear a regular bra with it.","I didnt think it wasnt as roomy, especially in the ribcage, as other reviewers seemed to indicate so I didnt need to size down.","My dresses arrived on time and returning them was a piece of cake.","I would definitely rent from Rent the Runway again."
"formal affair","I thought this dress would have been too long since im only 54 but it was just the right length.","Its stretchy and pretty forgiving.","The sparkle drew a lot of attention and compliments and was perfect for a holiday formal event.","I would rent this again."
"formal affair","The length, the fit, and the color were all perfect!","I got so many compliments on this dress!","The only issue is that the zipper sticks at one spot on the dress but once you get past that you will be fabulous all night long."
"formal affair","This dress was extremely comfortable and fits true to size.","I will say that if you rent this dress and have a smaller chest, just be sure to have a safety pin close by!","It does fall open on the top just a little bit, but nothing a safety pin cannot fix.","I loved the dress and got many, many compliments!"
"formal affair","Fits true to size..."
"formal affair","Loved this dress!","Worried about ordering a zero but it ended up fitting well.","The back is pretty loose but I ended up pinning which wasnt a problem.","Not the most comfortable dress but looked great!"
"formal affair","I loved this gorgeous, glamorous, glistening gold gown!","Felt fantastic all night.","Super comfortable and easy to wear.","The long sleeves were perfect for this polar vortex winter in NYC!"
"formal affair","I’m normally a size 8 and the 8 in this dress fit perfectly!","I was worried about it being too tight in the chest but it was just fine, actually could have been a little tighter.","My strapless bra I wanted to wear with this stuck out the sides a little bit and silicone petals looked weird so I had to tape my chest with athletic tape like Kim K and it looked and felt fine!","Loved the color, hidden zipper, and perfect length!","Got tons of compliments!"
"formal affair","Awesome dress!","Very elegant with a subtle element of sexy.","I wore it to a military ball and had one lady tell me it was her favorite dress shed seen that evening.","HIGHLY recommend it for the overall fit and comfort too."
"formal affair","The dress arrived without the belt.","I called RTR, and they were able to find it and send it to me in plenty of time for my event."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to my husbands Christmas party, and it was perfect.","I liked the wide triangular straps, the back opening, the length with the center slit, and the red color seriously pops.","The material was stretchy and form fitting, yet forgiving.","Only con was that I tried on several different bras with straps, and none of them could be worn with this dress without showing parts of the bra in the back, but I wore it without a bra and it was just fine.","I was going to wear a strapless bra, but was not able to wear one comfortably with this dress without feeling like it was too tight.","Id rent this dress again."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a Junior League formal and it was perfect!","I got a ton of compliments and felt great in the dress.","I am 511 so I ordered the long size and it was just long the right length.","The dress was a little tight around my left arm but other than that I have no complaints!"
"formal affair","The dress fits true to size.","I had a 6 as a back up just in case, but you wont need to size up.","I am a little short and maybe the dress couldve looked a little more flattering if I was 55.","Very comfortable, stylish, a little sexy but polished and professional which was perfect for my formal work awards ceremony."
"formal affair","I absolutely loved this dress!","It was perfect for the event we went to, and I got so many compliments which is always a plus!","The top is sheer (the reason for four stars), but I ordered a strapless black cami from Amazon to wear underneath - problem solved."
"formal affair","I am typically a size 2 petite, 34 A or B, and this dress fit perfectly around bodice.","Didnt need to wear any support pieces underneath.","The dress was a few inches too long for my 53 size, but I wore the highest heels I had (probably 4) and still need to carry the side of my dress most of the night.","Mostly because I was afraid Id trip.","Walking got easier once I was inside the event.","I wore it to a benefit at a downtown Chicago hotel.","It stood out well in a sea of black dresses.","I loved wearing the lighter (chiffon) material, and  it was so well made that it was perfectly appropriate for the season (Nov event).","When I put on the dress, I realized it is very worth it to wear a well constructed designer piece."
"formal affair","Comfortable while still fitted.","Pockets were a nice touch."
"formal affair","The dress runs a little large.","I am usually a medium and I wound up wearing the small, but maybe could have used the XS.","I can only speak to my experience about the neckline, but as a 36C, I found it to be a bit challenging with the open back.","I cant really go sans bra, so I wore a tape bra.","But those dont really give the girls much support/lift, so I was left wanting a little more in the cleavage department.","But it wasnt a deal breaker, and the dress otherwise was beautiful.","I loved that the color wasnt typical black, and the lace and open back made the dress feel really different and special."
"formal affair","I loved this dress!","Super comfortable and beautiful color (rose gold).","The decolletage was a little revealing for me but besides that it was great.","It does run big, I could have used a size or two smaller since the material is very stretchy.","I wore it to the AF Academy Ring Dance and it was a perfect choice.","A lot of sparkles this year."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a formal wedding and I felt beautiful in it.","The fabric is so comfortable and thick, although the dress is pretty heavy.","I would absolutely wear it again.","It runs pretty true to size, so I do wish I hadnt rented a size up."
"formal affair","Pro: fitted perfectly and hid all flaws.","No cons."
"formal affair","0R perfect for wearing flats at 57 - if I was wearing heels i would have needed the 0L for sure.","Gorgeous dress."
"formal affair","The peplum hit at the right spot and the sweetheart neckline was a great fit.","The wires in the top did end up pocking me towards the end of the event so it became slightly uncomfortable, but overall I would say the dress was a success!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress when I first tried it on.","Color is amazing, its super flattering with the triangle cut out in back at the neckline isnt too high to where its a turtle neck.","Loved it so much that I returned my back up dresses before the day of the event because I knew this is what Id wear.","Come the day of the event, the dress stretched out a good amount from just trying it on, walking around and getting ready in it.","Its not a stretchy/elastic material, so once its stretched out its like that for good.","Most of my photos it looked loose/baggy on me on bottom from walking around/sitting in it.","But I got more compliments on the dress than I ever have, so it may have just been me who thought it looked off.","My advice would be be careful taking it on and off, and dont put it on until you absolutely have to."
"formal affair","This dress was gorgeous at my sorority formal!","Runs true to size and the slit is fabulous.","Definitely best for an hourglass figure but looks pretty on an apple shaped girl like myself too!"
"formal affair","The dress was the perfect length to wear with tall wedges, loved the high neckline, and it showed off my small waist.","I wore a sticky bra with it."
"formal affair","I wish the shoulder was tighter.","Otherwise, it was the perfect dress!"
"formal affair","I wore this to my husbands Firemans Ball.","Im 54 and the regular length was perfect with a small heel.","I wore an skin colored under tank to offset the scratching of the sequins and it worked perfectly.","I was comfortable all night in the dress and loved how it flowed at the bottom when I walked.","I received many compliments on the dresses beauty.","I did order a size bigger than my normal size because of my bust and needed to wear that one.","I would highly recommend this dress!"
"formal affair","I received many compliments and really enjoyed wearing the dress.","It was comfortable and it had pockets!","Best ever!","Loved the detail on the neckline."
"formal affair","For tall girls, I am 510 and as other reviewers have said, the front is a bit short.","Your shoes will show.","If you wear flats or kitten heels you will be fine.","I wore ivory 2 inch heels that looked great with the rose gold sequins.","It is a very comfortable dress."
"formal affair","It would have been nice if this dress had a size in between 0 and 2.","0 was a little tight, but 2 gapped at the cutouts.","Overall, survivable for a 3 hour event.","Seriously, though, its a showstopper - I wore this to my end-of-year graduate school gala and WOW was the first thing a friend who was checking people in said.","Its a very modern cut, so accessorize edgy.","Dont be afraid to work it a little - this dress deserves it.","I wore a racerback bra with no problems.","Just for reference: Im a 32-26-36 and there was enough room for my hips (well, thighs, really)."
"formal affair","This dress really stood out in the sea of black dresses at the event I attended with my husband.","The dress fit perfectly and hugged all the right curves.","I felt beautiful and classy wearing this.","I got tons of compliments.","Dont even try the regular length if you are tall, though, the long was exactly floor length with 3.5 inch heels on.","The back bottom of the dress has a small train which I appreciated.","I was trying to get away with wearing a pair of sandals with a thick heel (more support for dancing) which wasnt necessarily the best choice for this dress.","However, with the train, no one could really see the heel.","Very elegant rental!"
"formal affair","Im grateful for the two sizes, but I ended up choosing my normal size, 10.","I was very happy with how the dress fit - the dress is rather low cut on the chest, and I ended up having to use one strip of Hollywood Secrets tape in order to keep the top in place.","I didnt have to wear a bra with this dress; I am a B cup."
"formal affair","Loved this dress.","Very flattering and got tons of compliments!"
"formal affair","I wore this for prom and the fit of the 2R was perfect on me and the length was exactly right.","The lace detailing, especially in the back, was beautiful."
"formal affair","I was a little nervous about the fit so I got a 12 and a 14.","I ended up wearing the 12 and it fit perfectly!","It was very flattering to my body type, however it was a little long even with heels (Im 55) so I used some hem tape and it worked fine.","I was just really paranoid about getting it ripped or dirty.","The green is a dark emerald, most pictures dont capture the true color.","Overall I was very pleased with my RTR purchase and I cant wait to order again!"
"formal affair","The dress came right on time and fit great!","I wore a 0R and it was slightly large in the bust, but other than that it fit perfectly!","I wore 4 inch heels and the length was just right.","The color is a very nice shade of red and looks great on.","I would highly recommend this dress!","Also, the process to rent the dress is very easy and user-friendly.","I would definitely use Rent The Runway again!"
"formal affair","Im normally a 4R but following other reviewers, I ordered the 4 and 2.","2 fit perfectly through waist, hips and length, but there was plenty of room in the chest/bust, even with a NuBra.","Would definitely rent again however -- there is just enough flair with the leg side panels to be fancy, but yet comfortable."
"formal affair","It runs small.","I usually wear a 2 or 4 and had to wear a 6."
"formal affair","Dress fit like a glove.","I usually wear a size 4 but it was not available so they sent a size 2 and 6.","The material is stretchy so I was able to make to 2 work.","The size 6 started to gap around my chest and waist."
"formal affair","This dress is a wonderful cocktail dress.","Just the right amount of sparkle.","I am pear shaped so the bottom of the dress fit perfectly but the top was a touch too big.","For those similarly shaped, I suggest a strapless bra as the cap sleeves can slip down your arms a bit when sitting."
"formal affair","Length was good with 3 heels.","Back was a bit tight but I have broad shoulders.","Overall, great dress.","Loved the lace!"
"formal affair","I took a chance and ordered just a 2R because the complimentary second size 0R was unavailable.","I will never take that chance again.","The dress was a little too big around my waist (25in for reference) which caused it to sag at the back.","I dont know if it was because of the size or just the nature of the dress, but it showed a LOT more side boob than I was comfortable with.","If you are going for a conservative look and have big boobs, beware.","Also, hooking the halter top definitely requires a second hand."
"formal affair","Great dress.","This might be my favorite RTR dress yet!","I got a TON of compliments and still am!","Fits true to size.","The only thing I would suggest is to use double sided fashion tape to hold the bow up on your chest but it isnt necessary."
"formal affair","This dress is striking.","It fits true to size as described in the materials.","I usually wear a 2 but ordered the 0 which was the right decision.","The high/low hemline works well for different heel heights.","I am 56 and wore 3 inch heels and it just hit the ground in the back.","The dress is also very easy to walk in.","The pockets are a bonus.","Large chested women may find the top a little snug but for the small to average bust it was fine.","I wore with a chunky pearl necklace for contrast and simple earrings.","The dress doesnt need much embellishment since it is so beautifully made.","I received many compliments."
"formal affair","Didnt have to wear a bra with it"
"formal affair","this dress was perfect for a formal affair, very comfortable and easy to wear"
"formal affair","Runs small through the bust/ribcage/shoulders.","I actually would have needed a 14 in this dress, and I can often wear a 10, with 12 being my average if things run true."
"formal affair","I could not zip the six up over the waist band and back.","Simply too small."
"formal affair","I wore this dress for my pageant  evening gown.","I loved it!!","It hugs all the right places.","The zipper is slow comming down but everyone loved it.","The fit was just perfect.","It could have been a bil longer with the 6L but I got 6R and came down to my feet"
"formal affair"," yhkhj"
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a black-tie optional gala in DC.","This dress was the perfect spin on the typical LBD, with unique and modern elements that made it stand out.","The long sleeves combined with the short skirt made it very appropriate for the season and occasion.","The skirt is a great length - not too short, not too long.","It comes lined with a cool structured slip that maintains the flare shape on the skirt.","Like other reviewers have mentioned, the waist on this dress runs really small so I highly recommend sizing up one or two sizes, especially if you have a larger waist/rib cage.","Im typically a size 8-10 and I wore a 12 in this dress.","The waist has absolutely no stretch so you want to make sure you have a size youll be able to get zipped up.","I received tons of compliments and would highly recommend this dress!"
"formal affair","I looooved this dress.","Was definitely form fitting, but very comfortable.","It was nice with the slit not having to worry about tripping on the dress as well, which can happen with a lot of long gowns.","However, sitting down with the slit, youre also baring a lot of leg.","Was an awesome dress all in all, I would definitely rent it again!"
"formal affair","Fits as expected, tight on your curves but not uncomfortable.","Would rent again!"
"formal affair","This dress is amazing!!","I am usually a 2 or 4, they didnt have the 4L available so I ordered the 2L and 6L  - the 2L fit perfect!","I wore 2.5 inch heels and the dress just skimmed the ground.","I have never received so many compliments in my life, people kept coming up to me asking me where I got the dress!","Rent this dress!","!"
"formal affair","I felt like a princess in this dress!","I was told over and over how beautiful I looked and how flattering the dress is.","The ONLY complaint I had is the boning dug into my ribs all night, but I would deal with that anyday to wear this again.","Rented the silver as my back up too but the Black was just stunning."
"formal affair","It was stunning.............quite eye catching"
"formal affair","Perfect dress for a black-tie affair if you dont want to wear a gown.","I wore it to a regional Emmys ceremony and it was perfect, received many compliments from total strangers all night.","The top runs a little large compared to the bottom, ideally the 6 on top wouldve worked best for me but I went with the 8 for overall fit"
"formal affair","This dress was EXTREMELY comfortable and it was not too heavy for a fully sequined dress.","I did wear some spanxx to smooth out my middle section, I was able to wear a normal bra, but I had to wear sky high heels so the dress wouldnt drag.","I loved the color of the dress as well.","Online it looks more steel gray, but in person it is more of a cool, gray-ish blue."
"formal affair","Size 4 was a perfect fit.","Im normally straight and narrow with no curves but this dress gave me a little figure which was fun.","I worn a thin slip and regular bra.","So comfy but a little restricting in the shoulder area for dancing or lifting your hand  about head.","My earrings were Stella & Dot Kaia Chandelier"
"formal affair","Fits great.","Really nicely complemented my body type (short, hourglass).","Modestly sexy, which I love!"
"formal affair","I ordered a 4L and 6L.","I tried 4L first and didnt even have to try to 6L.","This dress fit great!!","I chose the Long size due to the past reviews of other wearers around my size.","I was a little hesitant only because my heels were barely an inch.","But it still worked great and wasnt completely dragging on the floor.","It was a little tough to zipper only due to the change in fabric thickness at mid back.","I had so many complements on the color of the dress!","It being summer time in Arizona, the dress kept my cool and I was able to move around easily and dance!!","The dress did come with a stain but it was only noticed by my cousin once I was ready to go to the ball and it was in a spot around the outer thigh so not a huge concern of mine.","Due to the fact I have a smaller bust, I did have to keep pulling the dress up.","It fit great everywhere just wish the cups/breastbones were a little more form fitting but just since it is a rental I figured it was fitting like that due to having so many uses out of the dress.","Had a great experience through RTR and cant wait to rent my next dress!","!"
"formal affair","true to size"
"formal affair","For people who have a curvier body, I wouldnt recommend this dress.","It will make you look like a sausage.","It is very tight to fit into.","But if you have a slimmer, more athletic body, wear this.","Trust me.","Very complementing to certain areas."
"formal affair","Fit great, was a little long but I am short (51 or 2) but wore cute 3 shoes and was just about 1/2 inch too long but really couldnt tell.","Fit great.","Was definitely form fitting which was very elegant and sexy.","Huge fan of this dress.","I just had a baby 6 months ago so not in the best shape yet but the dress was very forgiving and scrunches in the right area to hide little flaws."
"formal affair","I wore this to an award show this weekend, and I had a ball in it!","I rented it as my backup, but its so gorgeous that I decided to wear it instead of the dress I thought I was going to wear.","It is SUCH a fun dress.","The back is so sexy and the front is the perfect combination of classy and fun.","I was nervous it was going to be too long, because Im only 52, but the regular length was perfect with 5 heals.","I was also nervous that the sequins would make me look bigger than I actually am, but they just made me look curvy in a good way!","I HIGHLY recommend this dress.","You will receive compliments all night."
"formal affair","It was a great fit, looked amazing with a chunky necklace.","I highly recommend it."
"formal affair","I rented both 4R/6R.","Both fit, but I went with the 6R primarily b/c it was so short on me.","Im 57 and my shoes were showing, not a look I was going for."
"formal affair","I loved the fit of this dress!","It has somewhat of a corset built in it but it was still comfortable to wear all night."
"formal affair","The cape adds an extra flair you wouldnt normally have in a little black dress.","Im normally an 8 in Trina and wore that size 22 weeks pregnant.","It hid my bump perfectly and from the front you couldnt tell I was pregnant.","Very chic style!"
"formal affair","I was pretty disappointed by this dress as I took it out of the bag and the front rouching was torn.","Had to send it back unfortunately."
"formal affair","I ordered three dresses and didnt wear any of them.","if you have any tummy, this is not the dress for you.","Im 56 and 150 lbs, and this dress was NOT attractive.","I ordered in both an 8 and a 10 and both fit, but not well.","Or, I should say, they both fit everywhere but the tummy.","I was not pregnant, but looked it.","length wise: Im 56 and was planning to wear 4 inch heals.","the long was too long.","Regular was the length to go."
"formal affair","I wore this to a black tie wedding reception and I got compliments all night long... the bride said I looked like a Grammy!","I was surprised the 6R fit as well as it did; I didnt even need to try on the 8R.","The length was a tad shorter than I had expected, but it worked out great.","I wore a pair of high-waist spanx (they come up to my bra line) and it surprisingly couldnt be seen with the open back.","Win!","The weight of the dress did an amazing job of smoothing out bumps yet hugging curves at the same time.","I paired the dress with RTR suggestions... a pair of earrings and gold clutch.","It may have been an issue with my shoes, but I did notice the train (the back was about 1-2 longer) kept getting caught on my heels.","I wore this dress at the end of August in Ohio = hot and humid.","Was it as breezy as a knee-length dress would have been?","Of course not.","But I didnt get overheated or feel like the dress caused any additional sweating.","Bottom line: I LOVE Rent the Runway!","I cant believe how great the condition of the dress was, considering its a top renter.","It was a fabulous experience and to anyone on the fence, you wont be disappointed!"
"formal affair","The dress is gorgeous, and it is very accommodating if you have a growing belly!","However, the zipper was very, very hard to zip up on the size 2, and the banded part was very tight across my ribs.","I tried the 4, but it seemed like it didnt fit better across my chest and was just wider on my hips so I went with the 2.","Breathing was a little difficult after I ate, but hey, pain is beauty, right?","Ultimately, I will most definitely use this service again because the process was so simple!","!"
"formal affair","The fit was perfect and this is a dress that will look good on many body types, including petite but voluptuous me.","So glad I did RTR for my work gala!"
"formal affair","Overall the dress fit nicely and the champagne sparkles looked awesome.","My only complaint is I wore my hair down and it kept on getting caught in the sequin in the back.","Id suggest wearing your hair up if wearing this dress."
"formal affair","This dress is VERY low cut and VERY beautiful!","The color is gorgeous too.","You really cant wear a bra with this but there are thin removable pads in it.","It is a bit shorter than I expected, but not so short I was worried.","I wish I had time to steam it because the lace on the front was a little folded from the trip, but it still looked great!"
"formal affair","I actually ended up wearing a different dress (Trina Turk - Portrait of Elegance) because I needed to have my shoulders covered and didnt have the right wrap or cardi for Reba.","I also had a tough time picking jewelry (should have let RtR do it)!","But this dress fits in all the right places and the lines make you look long and very lean.","Im usually between a 4 and a 6, but the 4 fit beautifully!","I might not have picked it online, but I tried it in the showroom and wow, it looked good.","The front panel is prettier in person."
"formal affair","The long size was long enough - Im 511.","The dress is incredibly comfortable and wears well all night."
"formal affair","Gorgeous dress!","A few warnings - it is much blacker than it appears in the photo.","It does run small so I chose to wear the 6 instead of my usual 4 and that was super comfortable.","Its a little big in the chest area - I had planned not to wear a bra since some of the other reviews said you didnt have to but my 34B cup size did not fill it out so I ended up wearing two sticky bra cups.","That worked perfectly.","Usually I dont like sticky bras because I like to dance but in this case the dress is tight enough to hold everything in place.","Overall would highly recommend!"
"formal affair","Absolutely loved this gown!"
"formal affair","This was my original pick for my gala event, but I was talked into a different dress.","I chose this one as my back up and Im so glad I did.","The original one didnt fit at all, but this one fit PERFECTLY!","I LOVE THIS DRESS!","Im  46 y/o, 51, 114 lbs, and slender with 34D/DD boobs.","Its sometimes hard to find a dress that fits.","I wore 4 heels and the dress skimmed the floor perfectly.","The back of the dress is open with a black fabric strap, which initially gave me some trouble.","My black strapless bra strap was wider than the fabric and you could see it very clearly.","Slight panic set in.","I opted to try the backless sticky bra thing and voila!","Perfect!","I seriously thought about just tucking the black fabric stips in and going totally backless (a first for this big boobed girl) but decided that by fastening the strip, it pulled it together better and gave the girls a little more support.","Didnt want any wardrobe malfunctions!","This was for a Great Gatsby themed charity event, and the dress stood out among regular everyday dresses.","It was perfect.","I didnt want to take it off!","Id definitely rent it again!"
"formal affair","I am 510 and the 6L fit like a glove.","I would absolutely order this again if it were available!","color is divine... lots of compliments!","Wish I had a picture to share!"
"formal affair","I wear Nicole Miller often and although I do wear the XS(P), this dress runs a little big.","The sleeves were a bit long and it is not as tight as some of her other dresses.","No matter, it was perfect, so comfortable.","Be prepared with the right bra...I wore it with a strapless that sits low in the back,  and I used one clear bra strap around my neck (like a haulter).","I tried using 2 clear bra straps but the back is too wide you can see them.","The around the neck works best (i hate wearing strapless :)) I highly recommend this dress from party to formal just change up shoes and jewelry for the occasion."
"formal affair","Bagdley Mischka does it again!","I love this dress!","I was extremely comfortable, the sequins were just flashy enough without requiring that this dress be worn only in Vegas, and I was able to dance all night!","I loved the length of the dress (I always find it difficult to have dresses that arent TOO short!)","and I could wear a normal bra.","The waist cinching is flattering and the gathering in the front is perfect to hide a large meal ;) I ordered the 8 and 10 and wore the 8 because it was a little more tailored at the waist.","Would definitely rent this again!"
"formal affair","It was super fun and I got so many compliments, the sparkles are really pretty and not too overwhelming.","The fit is also super flattering and hid my tummy which is a problem area for me.","I went with the medium and got the small as a backup size, the medium was a little bit big on top, but sticky boobs saved the day.","The small fit a little snugger but I found it highlighted my midsection a little more than the medium did, so I went with the medium.","My one issue was that it is a really heavy dress because of the sequins, and it did get a little hot after wearing it all night but I didnt find the sequins to be too itchy or irritating.","I would definitely recommend renting this!"
"formal affair","Only size available an 8, normally I wear a 4/6.","But, could carry off an 8 because of the tie at the back.","It hung beautifully."
"formal affair","This is by far the most comfortable formal dress Ive worn.","It is very figure hugging, but the fabric has some give, so it is comfortable.","Use spanx or other shapeware to avoid underwear lines.","I was able to wear a black bra.","For reference, in the two try-on photos, Im barefoot (510), in the photo with my husband, Im wearing 3 heels.","There is a slight train on the dress, so that helped with the length, but would have preferred 2 or kitten heels.","The dress would occasionally ride up a little in the hips area; sizing up might have helped, but it wasnt a big deal.","Very warm dress, perfect for a cold air-conditioned ballroom, or winter."
"formal affair","Only issue was the zipper.","The dress was not too tight... even my backup size (which was too big) I still had issues with the zipper"
"formal affair","If you are an apple shape, know that the waist is tight.","Youll need to size up.","This isnt cut in the usual plus sizing.","Luckily I had sized up and was able to get in it.","The nice thing is how the cinched waist is flattering.","I wasnt 100% happy with the dress.","Up close, I could see snags in the dressed when I got them- its that kind of fabric that snags easily.","I wore it anyway.","Also, this dress is short.","I am 55 and wore short heels with it.","The dress still didnt touch the floor.","If you are over 54 and want to wear high heels, definitely go for the long.","I got lots of compliments, and I really enjoyed the evening.","There is plenty of room in the bust area.","The color is great and its really a royal blue in person."
"formal affair","This dress fit amazing and I absolutely love it.","I would buy this dress.","I wore it to a benefit auction and got compliments all night."
"formal affair","I ordered a 0 and 2, but the 0 was still a little bit too big.","I used a little bit of fashion tape to hold the dress up, and it worked fine and held all night.","I got so many compliments on my dress throughout the night.","Id rent from RTR again!"
"formal affair","this dress was great!","got it for a charity gala - it was a heavy fabric which was perfect for a winter event.","the slit is not as dramatic as it appears online and I wish I had gone with a long size because it fell a little shorter with the small heels I had one."
"formal affair","The back of this dress is absolutely beautiful!","It came on time and in great condition.","I would definitely recommend this dress.","Its super flattering"
"formal affair","In a sea of plain black dresses me and this dress got noticed.","Very happy."
"formal affair","The dress fit true to size.","I am 55, 125lbs, 34 A and wore a size 2 perfectly.","Several reviewers said they could wear a regular bra with it, however I could NOT without visible bra straps/being worried theyd be visible.","I wore a strapless bra just fine.","The event was mostly sitting and therefore the comfortable nature of the dress was important so I wasnt tugging at things the whole time.","I highly recommend this dress."
"formal affair","Great, sexy and simple.","Almost too short for me in the long (Im 511), but since it is a column shape, it worked:)"
"formal affair","I was really worried about it fitting my hips, but it was stretchy and I wore spanx.","I also used water bra cups to lift the girls up.","It was a comfortable dress that was easy to wear all night.","Im 59 and wore a short heel, it was a bit short and the underlay stuck out at the bottom a bit, but I could easily pull the lace down a bit to cover it.","I didnt want to return the dress!"
"formal affair","Didnt end up wearing.","Material was much heavier and dress was much longer than I anticipated.","The neckline was also weird (on me).","Not my favorite dress Ive ever gotten from Rent the Runway.","Would not rent again."
"formal affair","This dress fit like a glove and made me feel beautiful!","Love,love,loved it!"
"formal affair","I rented this as part of my Unlimited order for NYE dress options.","No joking is it hard to get on... the dress gets caught in your hair and exterior is prickly!","Beautiful once on though, but it is a TWO person task and do your hair/makeup after its on.","More gold in person than the photo.","I am a D and there wasnt an obscene amount of cleavage either!"
"formal affair","Its fitted so definitely recommend being comfortable with that.","The high slit made the dress easy to wear.","The details on the neckline very classy"
"formal affair","This dress was snug in a good way.","I just lost almost all of my baby weight, still a couple pounds up from pre-pregnancy.","Pre-pregnancy I was a 2, so I ended up wearing the 4 and it fit perfectly.","The dress is sexy, but still very classy and elegant.","I wore this to a cocktail event for my husbands work and it was perfect.","My husband loved the cut outs!","Would definitely rent this dress again.","A winner!","For tall ladies, I did not find this dress ran too long like other reviewers.","I am only 53 and ordered the regular length and with 5 heels it was not touching the ground.","The length was perfect for me, but if youre tall, or more of an average height, I would still order the tall length."
"formal affair","Beautiful, flattering dress.","I was worried the sparkly top would itch or irritate my skin, which is sometimes a problem with sequins, but it was very comfortable.","The long was a bit longer than anticipated, but it worked with 4 inch heels."
"formal affair","Beautiful fabric and design!","The fit of this dress was perfect.","Again, Rent the Runway came through for me!"
"formal affair","The dress was definitely on the long side and ran a bit big.","I typically wear a 2, but could have done the 0."
"formal affair","While I chose fits true to size, it was a little small.","However, thats almost entirely due to the fact that Im a 38DD because it fit pretty much everywhere else.","It was a little tight even with two layers of Spanx but when my replacement gown didnt work, I had to make do - something I was happy to do because I liked this one better anyways.","I LOVE this gown so much.","Like I want to figure out a way to buy it.","When all the military wives & guests come up and tell you that your gown is their favorite (my first time at a military event) and how it perfectly matches and coordinates with his Air Force uniform, I must have done something right in picking this one.","I chose a Long per the size guidelines as Im 58 but a regular would have been just fine.","The back of the gown was nearly on the ground even in 4 heels.","I am probably a little too chesty for it (38DD) and could have gone braless but I just wasnt comfortable doing so.","I will say that I have a feeling the 14 would have been too large considering how borderline the 12 fit me.","Alls well that ends well and I would definitely rent this gown again.","In fact, Im looking for an event to do so!!","!"
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a work cocktail hour.","The dress was perfect, I also liked that you could wear a normal bra with it as well.","It is also a chic classy look with out showing too much.","Overall loved it!"
"formal affair","The dress had beautiful lace detail, but fit a bit small in the bust.","I would have preferred the overall fit of the 6 but with my bust size, I needed to wear the 8."
"formal affair","The fit is flattering, the dress is so comfortable and the color is beautiful.","I love the dress.","I rented it once for a wedding and the second time for a rehearsal dinner."
"formal affair","This dress was my original choice for a creative cocktail fundraising event with a jungle/animal theme.","While the dress itself fit, there was some strangeness to the fit of the bust.","It cut right across the center to create a really strange side profile.","I tried everything from a stiffer cupped bra to no bra at all and no matter what, I still ended up with a double boob.","Otherwise, the dress was absolutely flawless.","However, I think a size up would have been too big."
"formal affair","I received many compliments on the dress - I think mainly due to the unique neckline/shoulder detail.","It was dressy enough for a formal brunch, but not stuffy at all.","The waist and length were a bit loose on me (Im very petite) but it would look great on a taller girl."
"formal affair","#Fabulous #AllEyesOnMe"
"formal affair","My boyfriends company hosts an Annual Wine Tasting Night at the Casino and I was running super late, but I was able to get ready and still have enough time to join the party.","I walked into a crowded convention room and felt amazing, the dress hugged me in all the right places, the pockets made it number 1 in my book and my boyfriend couldnt take his eyes off me.","I received many compliments that night and would recommend this dress for any lady who wants to feel like a classic beauty!"
"formal affair","I adored this dress and all the attention it brought.","I definitely stole the party!!","The dress is true to size and like another reviewer wrote, not at all silver, more of a bronze/rosegold color.","It was a tad long, so I used fashion tape to take it up about an inch.","I got compliments all night and even more on Monday morning!","Id wear this dress again in a heartbeat.","Seriously amazing gown!"
"formal affair","The dress was very elegant, old Hollywood.","Tons of compliments and felt great all night.","You wont regret renting this beauty!!","!"
"formal affair","Runs a tad large; close to being true to size.","If you are between sizes, go down.","I tried both a 14L and 12L.","The 12L was more flattering and fit better in the sleeves.","I recommend ordering a L if you are at least 56 and plan on wearing a 4 heel.","Wore this with a statement necklace and it made all the difference.","Dress is too plain without it!"
"formal affair","I felt like a movie star in this dress, and I got a ton of compliments on it.","It was also very comfortable."
"formal affair","This dress is beautiful.","It has a nice drape and a little give because it is a little stretchy in the bottom.","I wore three inch heels and found it just a tad too long.","If I owned it, I would have hemmed a half inch.","I wore a normal strapless bra with it which was fine.","Although I would have preferred a backless, strapless bra to give me a bit more lift.","Very comfortable for dancing.","The day it arrived, I felt very pale in it and thought it made me look washed out, but got a light spray tan that night which really helped."
"formal affair","I wore the 2l.","This dress is extremely flattering and fit me like a glove.","The long was necessary for the 6 in heel I wore.","Chest area was a little tight on my small B bust so beware if you are bigger chested.","It really is a gorgeous dress and I got many compliments on it throughout the evening.","This was my first rtr experience and it was great.","Will definitely rent for my next event!","!"
"formal affair","The 6 didnt come in so I had to go with the 4 which ended up working but if you much of a chest then might be too tight.","Otherwise the dress was beautiful and perfect for a black tie wedding."
"formal affair","Nothing negative to say!","Definitely true to size.","The length was perfect for my height.","Did not need to wear a bra.","One thing you must know, this dress is ROSE GOLD!!","Plan accordingly.","This dress is just stunning."
"formal affair","I am 57 and typically wear 3 heels so I went for the long dress.","It was just a bit too long, I had to find the tallest heels in my closet to wear with them so that I didnt risk tripping or stepping on the dress.","Other than that the color, fit, and feel of the dress were perfect, I received a lot of compliments."
"formal affair","The dress was incredibly flattering.","The length was perfect.","It was my B dress but I had to wear it because it just fit so nicely and hugged my curves (in a good way)!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a black tie work event and, as always with RTR dresses, received many compliments.","Dress was very comfortable, and fit just as it appears on the model."
"formal affair","I received compliments all night on this dress!!","It fit really well for me and ran true to size.","The color is really pretty with the silver and so fun!","I highly recommend this dress for anyone.","I think it would work for all body shapes and sizes.","I rented two dresses to choose from and hands down this one was the winner!"
"formal affair","Length was perfect just below the knees, plenty of room in the arms and the shape was very flattering.","The detail in this dress is amazing!","!"
"formal affair","The dress fits true to size, completely accommodated my baby bump but it was a bit short for my liking so I ended up ordering the XL as well.","I do think its extremely hard to find the right shoe with rose gold, but the dress is so stunning, its a must order!"
"formal affair","Waist was a tiny bit tight, but probably fit like it was supposed to, I tend to err on the side of too large too often.","Bottom was nice and roomy, but was much fuller of a skirt than it looks in the model.","I would have preferred a slightly less full skirt, but thats just my style.","It definitely looked fine.","Top part of the dress fit perfectly.","The overall style of the dress felt fitting for the occasion, as well as my in between age at the event (more mature of a dress than the celebrating tweeners, not as formal or conservative as the mothers/grandmothers also at the event)."
"formal affair","I rented this gown as a backup when my original first choice wasnt available..","This gown is definitely flattering for any body type.","With a very full bust this dress covered the perfect amount while still showing some cleavage..","The color is AMAZING.","I received compliments all night and I would 100% recommend."
"formal affair","I ordered the small and extra small and ended up wearing the extra small just for a more snug fit on the chest and bust line.","I also wore a strapless bra with it but could have also worn sticky boobs if I had them.","I would recommend fashion tape if the chest is still a little loose.","Overall very happy!","!"
"formal affair","Dress was too short and ill fitting around the waist.","However my experience with RTR was once again amazing.","I was able to run down to the showroom and get assistance with finding a new dress the same day!"
"formal affair","It was the perfect size and ran pretty normal.","Might be short on a tall person (it was the right length for me and I was about 55 in heels).","It was elegant and gorgeous."
"formal affair","The fit was a little weird.","It was tighter on the hips but loose around the waste and chest area.","The looser fit did however make it more comfortable and the one shoulder detail was really pretty,"
"formal affair","Ordered this very last minute for a black tie party and it did the job nicely!"
"formal affair","You will look like a movie star and I am obsessed with it but keep in mind this runs very large.","I always wear a 2 or 4 in this brand and i wore the 0.","I had on 4.5 inch heels and the dress was incredibly long still.","Also vet heavy material so youll have to pull it up a lot.","Soooo hard to go to bathroom in--you have to take it off, cant pull it up.","That being said, beautiful and you dont need a bra.","Just not ideal for the short ladies!"
"formal affair","This dress does run small, I am usually a size 6 and ended up wearing a 10 in this, I am 510 so it was a little short but not too bad!","I would definitely wear this dress again, I got a ton of compliments and felt fantastic in it."
"formal affair","I am typically a 6 but needed the smaller size due to my height.","The first one was really long.","I spoke with customer service and they overnight a smaller size the very next day.","Only thing I didnt love about this was the length which couldve been resolved with higher heels.","I was getting compliments all night and I loved how great this fit!","!"
"formal affair","Dress was a bit large on top, but nothing too bad.","It was also a bit long even in heels, but considering my height that was expected."
"formal affair","Got a lot of compliments!","Especially love the pockets!","I was able to stash my phone and lipgloss.","Shoulders were a little loose on me, but I have overly tiny shoulders!",":-)"
"formal affair","It ran a little small in the bust.","I usually wear a 2, but Im glad I got the 4 because I ended up wearing it instead.","Other than that, I loved this dress and I would definitely rent it again!"
"formal affair","The length was perfect for a short woman wearing high heels.","The dress almost skimmed the floor.","The top had ample size for me (34DDD), just a touch of cleavage and I could wear a normal bra.","I loved the dress and it was perfect for the occasion."
"formal affair","Very flattering, comfortable, and fun.","The zipper seems pretty flimsy, though, and it had trouble making over the seem between the shorts and the top (and not due to sizing -- there was plenty of room).","I was actually worried about breaking the zipper and it made using the restroom stressful!","If not for the zipper situation, it would be 5 stars."
"formal affair","I am usually a size 14.","But the 14L ran a bit big around the mid section.","So I went with the 12L & as you can see perfection!","Thank you RTR.","I had an amazing time in this super comfortable gown!"
"formal affair","Great fit, flattering fabric, so comfortable to wear."
"formal affair","This dress fits perfectly in all the right places.","I have an athletic build and the fit was perfect!"
"formal affair","As many reviews stated, does run short, but I wore the 8L, wore 2 1/2 heels, and Im about 56 and felt the dress was just about right.","Probably could have worn slightly shorter heels but tends to be hard to find nice formal pumps shorter than 2 1/2.","Otherwise, dress was very comfortable, nice stretchy material and the rouching and the shawl cover all the areas you might want to cover-up."
"formal affair","It fit my 38I boobs.","That is a feat.","I got compliments from total strangers.","I had trouble with dresses in the past but this one was great.","It was a perfect length."

"formal affair","Customer Service for RTR were GREAT!","I ordered the 4S and 6S...","I received a 4R and 6SThe length on 4R was too long and the 6S had a whole in the arm..","I called RTR in a panic.. they worked with me to deliver another dress .... in the end it all worked out..","Dress was comfortable, everyone loved it..  =)"
"formal affair","I am a very large bust, which made this dress difficult to zip up in the upper back.","It took 3 people to zip up and some spanx!","I would recommend getting a size up!","The sequins didnt bother my arms, and it was very comfortable to dance in."
"formal affair","The fit was just short of excellent , it fit in all the right places I just felt a little uneasy with the amount of cleavage being revealed."
"formal affair","Zipper was  tricky and would snag on fabric and was very difficult to zip at times.","I am 56 and wore 5inch heels and the length was perfect!","got so many compliments and this was my dream prom dress!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a formal wedding in Texas at the beginning of December.","I was 20 weeks pregnant and wanted a dress that made me feel sexy but also highlighted my bump and provided an element of comfort.","This dress hit all those marks for me.","I would normally wear a size 6-8 but the 10 P was the last petite size left in that range.","It was a little big but the extra room was comfortable.","The top was loose and I was able to wear a strapless bra but did have to lift the dress up a few times.","The sequins under the arms rubbed a little but but that was a very minor complaint.","I wore 2 heels and the length was spot on.","I received compliments all night long and love how it made me feel and look.","Definite winner!","(height 54, 147# at the time)"
"formal affair","I originally wanted another dress and this was my back up, but my first choice wasnt available.","I went with the 12L because the sleeves were too short in the 10L but I could for it comfortably.","It was a little lose but the dress, overall, was flattering.","Being my first rental, I would have to say I will be using yall again."

"formal affair","Fit true to size.","Extremely comfortable.","I felt like I was floating all night.","The dress just moved with me.","The color was beautiful and I received complements that night and in the weeks following our wedding weekend.","Im hoping for another event to reorder this dress!"
"formal affair","I rented this dress for my senior homecoming dance and I received so many compliments from girls and guys alike!","It was comfortable enough to dance in and I could move freely although the arms were not lined and did get a little itchy.","The length is great, not too short and the sequins have a bit of a red tint to it, giving it a little pop of color!","A great dress, you will not be disappointed!","!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress!","I looked great and felt amazing.","Im 58 and had on 2 heels, it still brushed the ground.","I got so many compliments on it!","It hugged in all the right places and moved with me.","The only small issue I had was some of the boning had poked through at one of my ribs- I fixed it with a bandaid.","Thank-you, I felt like a million bucks!"
"formal affair","Very low cut- definitely dont recommend if youre large chested!","The tie did not secure the top enough to make this comfortable to wear.","Wasnt impressed with the dress overall, and the material isnt great for a black tie event."
"formal affair","dress was great,  did not want long or too bare, the lace was just sheer enough to be dressy, formal and elegant without being too revealing"
"formal affair","I wear medium but decided to wear the large to be safe."
"formal affair","I wore this to a black tie Christmas party.","I followed the sizing chart on this site and ordered a large, which was too large and long.","I was hoping for it to be fitted at the empire waist (or semblance of it) and to pull off my 4 inch heels (Im 54).","I had to make it work though (with tape and pins)!","It was definitely a beautiful dress, but I would size down to get the best fit and the wow factor that I suspect this dress can pull off.","The color was a bit more bronze than gold in my opinion.","In my opinion this gown is Simple, sophisticated and has just enough glam.","You can dress it up or down."
"formal affair","It was almost too long so anyone shorter than 5’4” should not order.","I had on 4” heels too!","The chest area for perfectly.","Could be tight if you have large chest."
"formal affair","This dress was gorgeous!","I ended up wearing a 4L because the 6L was a little too large in the upper body.","Im 510/145 lbs and the dress just barely skimmed the floor with flats on.","I could have probably gotten away with a short heal, but I liked the way the dress skimmed the floor.","It was comfortable, very appealing, and I received tons of compliments all night long.","Id definitely reserve this dress again."
"formal affair","Beautiful on, true to size, comfortable.","The size fit great but the was a tad longer and more roomy so I could eat more, I wore this to a formal night on a cruise."
"formal affair","Pros: This is a beautiful dress with a great weight; its not to heavy, yet the fabric is high-quality.","Its perfect for petites!","I am 53 and wore 4-5 heels.","The dress just skimmed the floor, which is exactly what I wanted.","The shape of the dress is also great for curvy girls as it really shows off your figure.","I got many compliments on it.","Its classy, timeless, and the 2 fit me like a glove.","Typically I wear a 2 or a 4 dress size- although Im very curvy, so I can be a tough fit.","Mermaid dresses tend to work well!","Cons: You can tell that this dress has been worn a lot.","The fabric around the bust and arms was a little worn.- nothing too noticeable to others, but worth noting.","Additionally, the boning on the right side of the torso was coming out and digging into my side when I sat down, which was a little uncomfortable.","Overall, great dress!","If you plan on ordering the 2R- I would contact RTR and see if they have a newer one available to avoid the wear & tear."
"formal affair","The dress fits like a glove and its extremely complimentary to all types of bodies.","I am not a petite woman, but it fit beautifully and i felt so sexy :-).","the only downside to the dress is the beading at the underarm area, it is a bit uncomfortable especially when dancing.","But i believe that the discomfort was worth it,because it made me feel like a goddess !!","i highly recommend it."
"formal affair","This dress fit me like a glove!","I typically wear either a 4 or a 6, and the 6 in this dress was perfect for me.","I wore it for a Marine Ball and it was surprisingly easy to move and dance in.","I was a little worried about the length, since Im on the shorter side, but I just wore heels that were a little taller than I would normally wear and I was good to go.","I would definitely recommend this beautiful dress!"
"formal affair","It fit snug around the bust area but good every where else.","True to size, and a good simple dress for a  formal affair."
"formal affair","I wore this to a military ball and I was the only one with a dress like this in a sea of 300+ people.","It is stunning in person and I received a ton of compliments on it.","Its a tad tight in the bust for those who are well endowed and for shorter ladies you really need heels that are at least 4 inches.","I wore 3inch heels and it was still slightly dragging on the ground.","Those two things would not stop me from renting this dress again.","It is very flattering and you cant beat having pockets!"
"formal affair","This dress was amazing!","The neckline is so flattering and the fit was excellent.","I dont typically wear red but this color was a knockout.","Its definitely form-fitting so if you want something you can eat and be comfortable in, this may not be the best option.","Im 54 and wore 3 heels...the dress was still a bit long but worked fine by just holding it up.","It did make me look so much taller!","Overall I loved this dress and would absolutely rent it again."
"formal affair","overall great dress"
"formal affair","I felt glamorous in this dress.","At first, it seemed that it might not have too much pizazz.","But when I put it on and added the accessories, I thought the dress was beautiful.","I received many compliments throughout the night and it was perfect for the formal gala I attended for work.","I was scheduled to wear the size 2 but the zipper broke and the waist on this dress kept digging into my body.","I wore the 4 and it fit perfect through the waist, but I have a small bust, so I did double up with a nu bra and then my strapless bra over that.","It worked out just great."
"formal affair","Perfect fit!"
"formal affair","Perfect dress for the athletic build.","Due to CrossFit my daughter has a very athletic butt and thighs so the a-lined nature of this dress was perfect.","She normally wears a size 4 but we read that almost everyone went a size down with this dress.","The 2 fit perfectly.","From the minute she tried it onto the night she wore it she was so happy and received compliments ALL night.","The dress was comfortable and didnt need to be steamed before wearing.","We used a sticky bra underneath and some dress tape (although the dress tape did not stick very well to the fabric on this dress.","Luckily wearing the 2 made it so the dress fit so perfect the tape was not really needed."
"formal affair","My 1st choice dress became unavailable at the last minute in my size -- Im glad I hadnt purchased accessories to go along with it because I had to completely change my concept to wear this dress.","I wasnt excited about wearing a black & white monochrome dress, but because of the design and pattern, it ended up being really fun anyway.","The top is really stretchy and runs a little big.","Which means theres a little give in the keyhole section, which is good and bad.","Good, it didnt splurt my back fat out like a sausage, but the side panel kind of bunches, as you can see in the photo.","Pro: YOU CAN WEAR A REGULAR BRA!","GAH."
"formal affair","The dress was very beautiful, seems well made of high quality material.","Unlike in the photo on the model, the layers are not as visible.","The lace at the shoulders is beautiful and delicate.","Because the dress was slightly too big in the waist  I didnt have to suck anything in, so I was comfortable all night."
"formal affair","My first dress didnt work out, but fortunately I loved this one even more than the original!","I was hesitant, because the dress pictures looked kind of old lady online, but in the reviews it looked stunning!","I took a chance since it was the day before my event and not many dresses left, and they were able to overnight this new dress.","I dont think you need to size up like it recommends.","The 4L (my normal size is probably a 4) worked perfectly, and even the 2L fit (but it was a bit shorter so I wore the 4L).","Also, it worked perfect for my tall self.","Im about 511 and it was the perfect length with flats, and I probably could have worn a small heel.","It was classic, yet super sexy.","My butt and boobs looked awesome, but if you are super busty just be aware they might be hanging out a bit.","It was a bit more cleavage than Im comfortable with, but it was fine for the event and my husband loved it.","The stretch in this dress made it very flattering and hides minor flaws (I didnt need to wear Spanx or anything).","It fit my hourglass shape better than most dresses since it forms to your body (without being uncomfortable).","My only complaint is that the sleeves kind of pull after a while and the lace makes it a bit uncomfortable, but it was only a minor concern.","Wish I could have kept this dress!"
"formal affair","I ordered a 4R and a 6R.","To be honest, they fit the exact same - except the 4R had a zipper on the side and the 6R did not.","The arms were a little looser on the 6R, but they were not too tight on the 4R.","The 4R was brand new (with tags on it!)","and the 6R had been worn before, and I could tell the difference in the stiffness of the fabric.","I definitely could not wear a low-strap bra with this, and instead just opted to not wear a bra at all.","I also did not have to wear SPANX, the front was loose enough that it wasnt showing off any wobbly bits.","I did notice that at the neckline and the arm holes I got a little itchy from the sequins, but not enough to ruin my evening.","I am 56 and I ended up wearing 4 nude heels, which were tall enough to get the little train in the back off the floor.","If I wanted it to drag a bit, I probably could have worn lower heels or flats.","Everyone complimented me on my dress, and even though it was summer in Arizona (and a bit WARM), I would totally rent this dress again.","It is SO sparkly, I felt like a human disco ball."
"formal affair","I so wish that they had this dress in a petite size.","Honestly, it was gorgeous.","Every single person I spoke to commented on what a wonderful dress I was wearing!","I ordered both the 44 and 42 and ended up wearing the 42 as the top of the dress was just a bit too big for me (Im short, so everything on me is shorter than other people).","I was going to wear my hair in a chignon, but decided to wear it down and curly to mask the extra fabric in the shoulders and that worked well.","Honestly, I ADORE this dress and wish they had it in smaller dimensions for us shorties.","With 3 inch heels, I was still walking over the dress."
"formal affair","This dress hugged all my curves in the right places and I also am pretty muscular too so it fit my broad shoulders as well.","I felt like a million bucks!","Glamorous and comfrortable!"
"formal affair","Dress was super comfortable, pockets allowed me to store the extra items  my clutch could not hold.","I have a large bust and going bra-less doesnt always work.","This dress gave me the support I needed."
"formal affair","great dress"
"formal affair","Stretchy material, hugs curves great.","Make sure to wear backless bra.","The dress was perfect."
"formal affair","I loved this dress.","It is such a magnificent color!","It is as deep as pictured.","I paired it with dangly sparkly earrings (Ben Amun Elise Earrings from RTR) and a big sparkly bracelet.","A dress this rich in color only needs minimal accessories and a red lip to look stunning!","I received compliments all night at my fiances Oscar-themed company holiday party.","However, be warned that this dress runs VERY small.","I am a solid 4 in dresses -- J.Crew, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, etc., and I just got into the 8, which was my emergency backup size since I read that the dress runs small.","The material, while gorgeous, has NO stretch whatsoever.","Because I am an hourglass shape, this meant it didnt grab me as tightly in my waist as I would have liked, but it still skimmed my curves remarkably well.","It also runs short.","I am wearing 4.5 inch heels, but I easily could have worn flats and it still would have been just below my ankles above the floor.","I wish I had ordered a long.","I am only 55 and would have never thought to order anything but a regular!","Also, they dont picture the back -- the straps form a simple V shape that hits the mid back.","In sum, its a gorgeous vintage style dress, but order two sizes up and a long if youre 54 or taller."
"formal affair","This dress was stunning, would be beautiful on many different body types.","Very comfortable and flattering."
"formal affair","This dress was incredible!","The fit ran very true to size and it hugged my body in all the right places.","i was originally worried that it wasnt going to fit my chest because Im a bit larger up top but i had absolutely no troubles with it at all.","i highly recommend this dress and would DEFINITELY wear it again."
"formal affair","The dress I originally wanted to wear was too tight and I ended up wearing this one and loved it.","I wore flats and it ended up being fine since Im tall.","Im pretty lanky, but pear shaped, so it fit my hips fine but was loose in the waist.","It would have looked a little better the waist had fit better on me, but it worked out great.","The dress was great but pretty insulating and if the gala had not been inside, I would have been burning up in it.","Overall, I absolutely loved wearing it!"
"formal affair","The size was fine, the dress looked amazing and I received lots of complements at the event.","The zipper was very difficult to zip up due to 1) gathered dress in the back 2) tiny sequins getting into the path of the zipper 3) probable normal wear and tear on the zipper and it needed lubrication.","The sequins on the top of the strapless dress were itchy/irritating, but most of the time I forgot about them.","If you have extremely sensitive skin, this dress is not for you."
"formal affair","Flattering through the body, but the arms are very tight!","Had to size up from an 8 to the 10 to accommodate."
"formal affair","This dress was lovely to wear to my husbands formal Christmas work party.","The good:  I was able to dance easily in this dress, it fit well and I received many compliments throughout the night.","The not so good: the dress felt slightly worn..the back zipper was difficult to zip up and the top hook did not stay closed.","I had to conceal and close the top hook with a safety pin.","I imagine this is due to many dry cleaning runs and general wear and tear.","The smaller size (size 0) had an arm pit smell to it and the bottom stitching was coming off.","This was my first time using RTR.","I may do it again but find it somewhat pricey."
"formal affair","This dress was rented for prom.","It looked beautiful.","No spanx needed.","It was elegant, extremely flattering and (best of all) comfortable.","This was our first rental, so we were very nervous.","The dress fit perfectly and my daughter got lots of compliments."
"formal affair","I am very hippy and this dress elegantly hugged my curves.","Perfect length and very comfortable."
"formal affair","I actually didnt end up wearing this dress - it was my back up dress and the dress I rented as my first choice ended up fitting perfectly.","But it was a toss up - seriously this was gorgeous and fit beautifully.","It was a little bit more conservative than I expected it to be, but would have been so fun to wear.","LOVE!","I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"formal affair","Im 53 so high heels (5 - 6) were a must!"
"formal affair","It does run a little on the large size.","Definitely size down.","This dress was perfect for my body.","Hugged and cinched in all the right spots.","The color was amazing.","It made my already blue eyes look ridiculous...in a good way.","I paired this with simple black pumps and simple minimal jewelry.","The dress is stunning an should be the star of the show.","At 5 8 with quite the booty I was really worried this was going to be too short once I got in my heels.","No worries.","It is the perfect length.","Hits just above the knee.","Also, being rather chesty I was nervous it would be inappropriately boobalicious.","Not the case.","Enhances your ladies and shows them off just enough.","You feel sexy but not trashy.","I kind of want to live every day in this dress.","You arent going to want to return this.","I sure didnt."
"formal affair","I am 510 definitely needed the Long, I wore a low 1.5 heel.","The top definitely favors a chestier body or the sides dont hang properly."
"formal affair","Normally I wear a size 0.","But, unfortunately the dress sent to me was stretched and didnt lay right.","So, I used the size 2 instead, and it worked just fine.","I literally had people coming up to me the entire night telling me how much they loved the dress!","And, it was extremely comfortable!","I wore 4 inch heels and the length was perfect"
"formal affair","I wore the dress backwards because I tried it on backwards originally by accident, and it fit & looked good, so I ended up wearing it backwards.",":) The dress fit great, but Spanx were a must!","I wore a regular bra with mine.","I would definitely order a size down.","And the long is a must!","Im 57 and the long was almost too short.","I had to wear flats.","I usually wear an 8 - but I ordered a 6L as my backup and ended up wearing that.","(I havent worn a size 6 dress in a longggg time).","So order a size smaller!",":) I wore this to the Grammys and got so many compliments.","I definitely recommend this dress!","Its a beauty!","!"
"formal affair","The dress was amazing!","It was definitely very TIGHT - so there was no need for spanx, I didnt even need a bra.","If I felt like any part of me looked unflattering or was sticking out farther than I wanted it to (i.e.","my tummy), I just readjusted the scrunching on it and voila, problem spot hidden.","To note: it is a mermaid dress so it is still tight around the knees -- Im not used to that so it was difficult for me to walk with my usual stride so I just made my date walk slower :) Im 54 and wore very tall heels (maybe 5 in.)","so the dress was not quite touching the ground in the picture."
"formal affair","I love this dress.","I actually found it at the BCBG store but struggled paying almost $400 to wear it 1 time.","Lo and behold my friend found it on RTR and it was mine!","I love this dress.","I have a large bust so it was a little plunging on me, but the overall fit and flare style is super flattering.","The dress itself is a beautiful dark blue with a shimmery (but not cheap looking) scroll design on it.","The material is lightweight but substantial and has a good amount of stretch which makes it  very comfortable.","The condition of the dress was perfect too.","Great experience!"
"other","This dress fit great (the stretchy fabric helps with that) and extremely comfortable.","My shoulders were a bit too broad for the cap sleeves, so they kept riding up whenever I moved my arms.","The sheer quantity of lace is really dramatic, although I did wish that it had some variation in the lace or a few more embellishments.","You can wear a regular bra and panties, no problem."
"other","The top was a little large for my bust size but I was able to make it work."
"other","I wore this to a cocktail event.","It was comfortable, a nice fabric that you can appreciate more in person than online.","With some nice heels and jewelry, I got compliments and was comfortable.","It does run large though, so get one just below your size in case your true size fits too big."
"other","I wore this dress to church and loved it!","Everyone also loved it.","I got so many great comments.","The only thing that I felt a little something about was the fact that the lining was longer than the dress.","Other than that, it was a good rent."
"other","Rented this for NYE party.","Wish it had a little more sparkle.","Ended up being way too casual for what I wanted to wear it to."
"other","I rented this dress for a formal dinner and Broadway show in NYC.","I am 56, 135 lbs, and ordered a size 6 with a 4 as a backup.","I was surprised to get an email a couple of days before my event letting me know that the 4 was unavailable.","Fortunately, the 6 ended up being perfect.","Like most reviewers, Im sure I could have fit into the smaller size, but its a sheath dress and is designed to be a little loose (and its actually much more flattering in person than in pictures).","It was comfy but appropriately dressy for a warm spring night.","The color is lovely and I got a lot of compliments.","Great pick!"
"other","Fitted, shows your curves, short!!!","I wore booties and a dark brown leather jacket with it."
"other","This was my first foray into the world of summer jumpsuits, and I  never looked back.","Its such a cool take on the standard dress for a party or a weekend night out.","This blue jumpsuit felt hip and different.","Its not quite as bright cobalt as in the official photo, but definitely not as dark as in mine.","(Im clearly taking this picture from a bathroom closet.)","It fit well, true to size, and was extremely comfortable!","You might be able to do a strapless bra if it lined up just perfectly, but Id plan to skip it if you can.","Would definitely rent again."
"other","This fluttery skirt is super cute in person.","The polkadot print is cheerful without being loud.","The background color was softly pink tinted.","Thankfully I read the reviews and saw that the waist runs small so I opted for a size up and it fit perfectly.","I very much enjoyed this flattering skirt."
"other","This dress was very comfortable and great to wear out to dinner & drinks.","The material was a little thicker so itd be good in the early fall.","I loved the cap sleeves and the pattern.","Was a nice change up from the standard LBD.","It was a little short when I was sitting for dinner but if you plan on standing and dancing the whole night, rent it!"
"other","The 38 Fit better overall, but the back didnt lay as flat as I would have liked.","The 40 was a bit loose.","The color was pretty but the only reason I ordered it was because my friend wanted the bridal party in a light blue for her shower.","I would have never rented it otherwise.","It was just ok, a little too stiff and modest for me."
"other","This dress is not only cute and trendy, but its very breathable and comfortable to wear all day long.","I never fidgeted or had to fix the dress!","It was a perfect fit <3"
"other","This was my favorite rental yet!","The fabric was thick and extremely flattering and the print was show stopping.","I got so many compliments on this unique dress...","I wish I could wear it over and over again!","As far as sizing goes, both the small and the medium fit well.","I chose to wear the medium because it was a bit warm outside and the looser fabric was more comfortable temperature-wise.","I would suggest that you order this true to size.","Regarding the weather, it was in the high 70s when I wore this and, surprisingly, I wasnt as hot/sweaty as I thought I would be.","I would recommend this dress to anyone thats looking for an eye catching, unique dress to rent!"
"other","I LOVED this dress.","It was perfect for the event, and ran very true to size.","I loved the mesh fabric that created the peak-a-boo illusion.","It allowed for me to wear a nude bra that you could not see.","It was a little short, but I would for sure rent this dress again!"
"other","Pretty dress just runs too big"
"other","It was the perfect LBD"
"other","This fits true to size and I LOVED it!","Very complimentary.","I will rent over and over again once its spring...colors a little too bright for winter.","I am hour glass and the 6r fit me just fine.","Reviews are right, zipper is very tricky but once you get the hang of it youll be good the rest of the night.","Also spanx help"
"other","This jumpsuit was incredibly well tailored and well made.","It fit me perfectly, and I absolutely did not want to take it off!","The only problem I had was the torso is a bit short, so when you sit down it rides up a bit and the neck gets a little uncomfortable.","It was more of an annoyance than an actual problem.","Im usually a true 0 and the 2R fit great besides this one issue.","Also its tricky to find a bra that doesnt show, so I just wore a black razor back and the straps only poked out a few times, but it blended in mostly.","Not a problem really at all.","If you have a long torso I would  definitely recommend sizing up.","I also have long legs but the length of the pants was perfect, also loved the zipper detail.","Overall this was a fantastic rental, and PERFECT for seeing Wicked at the Fox Theatre!","I recommend renting for a fun and fancy event.","I dressed it up with a gold chain necklace and black suede pumps."
"other","Such a feminine and girlie piece.","The bow on the back makes the entire dress.","Run big."
"other","I generally wear a 6 or an 8 and the 6 was perfect and not tight.","Super soft!"
"other","This was a perfect dress for my Godsons 1st communion.","I received many compliments but the best part is it was very comfortable.","The only thing I would have changed is the volume of the upper portion that can add some unwanted size to the chest area but at the same time it balanced out the upper/lower body proportions.","From what Ive read in other reviews, what shoes to wear with this dress seems to be a big issue.","I wore with the TOMS strappy wedge in blue ikat.","The print not the shoe matched perfectly to the print on the sides of the dress and I was asked several times how I found shoes that did that."
"other","I rented this dress for a work charity function and it was perfect.","The cut flatters the body but isnt revealing or too sexy.","I could have worn the smaller size but the midsection on both dresses was snug so I went with the larger.","In terms of length, it hit just above my knees.","The crepe fabric is pretty forgiving and this could easily be dressed up or down.","Loved it!"
"other","I normally wear a size 4 or 6 US and I think this was a UK8 so it does run true to size.","I am a 36D and it was tight on the boobs but I didnt mind.","It really held me in.","Pattern is beautiful.","Dress is much prettier in person and even though it fits close to the body it is very easy to walk and move around in.","LOVED IT!"
"other","I was in charge of my best friends Bachlorette Party and the theme was pink and glitter.","So to surprise her, I got us both RTR sequin dress.","This dress was perfect for the occasion.","It fit like a glove and was very flattering.","The sequins did not rub or anything.","This was a great decision for the night."
"other","I rented this dress for Thanksgiving as part of the rent three for the price of one promotion that RTR was offering, and I was very happy with my rental.","I was a little nervous because there werent many reviews or pictures yet, but I think the dress was just a newer rental.","It was pretty form fitting but in a flattering way; the material was fairly forgiving as well (aka-stretched where it needed to stretch).","I was a little concerned about the arms being tight since that has been an issue for longer sleeved dresses for me in the past, but that was not the case.","I held back the fifth star because the zipper was a bit of a pain, and although I wore it with tights, I think it would have been itchy without them.","All in all, I would definitely think about renting this again."
"other","I actually chose this as a back up dress and had to find a place to go to wear it.","It was beautiful and I couldnt just send it back before wearing it out!","The only negative thing about this dress is that it is very long.","I had the regular and it was dragging on the ground even in heels.","I would definitely go for petite or short next time.","I am 52 Otherwise beautiful!"
"other","A modern twist on a LBD maxi dress!","Something that is really unique about this dress is the side slit and the see through paneling in the front bust area!","You will need to either go bra less or wear a Nubra with this dress as it is see through.","Although fairly fitted in the natural waist there is comfortable room in the hips.","You can complete this look with a statement earring and classy black stilettos!"
"other","The back is sexy"
"other","While the dress runs true to size the waistband was on the tighter size.","It was a little challenging to zip because of the change in fabric, but once it was zipped it was quite comfortable."
"other","The lace is classy and the open back is unique.","I havent worn it yet, but I bought it at a sample sale because I know I will have a couple of events coming up this year that I will wear the dress.","Beautiful navy color!","I plan on pairing it with a silver or gold clutch, simple earrings and evening sandals.","So glad I bought it and I paid a cheap price!"
"other","I am normally a 16 in jeans and blouses.","I ordered both the 16W and 18W dresses.","I tried on the 16W and it fit perfectly on top, but the bottom fit tightly around what my mom calls my perfect birthing hips.","So, I opted for the 18W since I was wearing this to my beautiful baby nieces (and now Goddaughters) Baptism and wasnt looking to bring the boys to the yard.","The 18W was a bit big up top.","So much so that every once in a while the zipper would bulge in the back and give me a hump.","It fit perfectly on the bottom, though, and it came down to right above my knees.","It was super comfortable material and the color was awesome!","I paired it with black heels and gold accessories.","I didnt even wear a necklace, since the neckline was set up high.","I received many compliments from both strangers and family.","This was my first rental and I will definitely rent again!"
"other","It has a beautiful color and sturdy, flawless fabric.","I ordered a medium because the small was unavailable but it worked overall because Herve dresses really hold their shape.","It was just a little loose in the tummy and chest but no one noticed.","Its a great length for short girls.","I wore it to a networking event and managed to look sexy but still put together."
"other","This dress is absolutely lovely.","The details are exquisite and the dress is very classy.","The reason for the 3 stars is that as a petite woman, I am just under 51, the dress at the top was very low cut.","The top of the dress also felt large and it kept coming off of my shoulders.","I ended up wearing a nude camisole underneath because the top of the dress exposed a lot of cleavage.","If I were had a long torso I would have been fine as it would have taken up the extra inch of dress at the top."
"other","The only issue was the cape kept falling off my shoulder.","Also, those hanger strings kept popping out.","The size 4 was too loose overall.","So I stuck it out with a 2 which was a little tight around my stomach area and hips but not unwearable.","Nothing a little tape cant fix!","!"
"other","I rented this for my grad school graduation ceremony, but I loved wearing it so much that I also wore it to a formal dinner.","The legs are LOOOOONG on this item, and even with my highest heels, I still had to do a bit of temporary microsurgery on this item so I wouldnt trip and fall on my face.","The snap in front is a bit delicate, so its pretty easy to catch and have everything fly open; I wore a nude strapless bra just for extra precaution.","Im contemplating buying this and getting it properly hemmed b/c it is just such a fun, fancy piece for summer."
"other","This was my first rental.","I ordered a M but the L backup size was not available.","My waist was not flattering in this dress so I didnt wear it to my event.","I wish I had ordered something else now that had the backup size.","However the overall experience was so easy.","I will be renting again going up a size with the item & definitely getting a backup size."
"other","The color was much more of a vibrant hot pink than the picture led me to believe, but I love the color even more!","All the comments are accurate - it is a very short dress (and Im saying that being only 53), it is not very forgiving in the tummy area because of how low the drop waist is (nothing a little spanx cant fix).","Overall, I had a great experience with RTR and already have my next rental lined up!","Definitely recommend this dress."
"other","Runs a bit small but still really comfortable and easy to move in.","The fabric is really thick so it warm without being stifling.","I ended up fully zipping and then tucking the neck down a bit .","But its still pretty restrictive to any tilting of the head.","Like other reviewers have noted theres major side boob."
"other","The dress is gorgeous.","Runs REALLY small!","I usually wear a 14 in a dress but read the reviews and ordered the 16 and 18... wore the 18 as it runs so small.","It is also pretty low cut.","The lace covers you up a bit but I was really conscious of how much cleavage was showing (Sorry I totally forgot to take a pic!!).","Got tons of compliments on the dress and overall I did feel great!","Wore it for my rehearsal dinner for my wedding."
"other","I needed a white top for family photos and it turned out great.","I have also worn it to work but may show too much skin for some work places, I did wear a jacket over it and even though the sleeves are a little poofy at the ends it looked fine under the jacket.","I would definitely consider buying"
"other","I ended up not wearing this dress, though I had rented it for Easter Sunday because of the spring colors.","The fabric felt expensive and the cut was flattering (yay wrap dresses!).","The pink appears much richer in person and the flowers are a little bigger than I personally prefer in a dress.","I think this dress could be great but I just didnt love it."
"other","Such a comfortable and fun dress I decided to make it work vs sending it back.","I added a sheer black blouse and a lace half-camisole to offset the plunging neckline issue.","-- Mega-stretchy so it will both show what ya got and adapt to various body types.","Thick material good for smoothing over things.","-- Id size down for backup, though broader shoulders or larger bust might fill out top ok-- DEEP plunge to bottom of bra band on me ( Im short-waisted so also had a little extra fabric in back)-- Longer in the back on 54 me than is ideal for flattery (hit mid-calf), but curving high-low hem makes this a special dress so I left it alone"
"other","This is the perfect for a birthday or bachelorette party!","I am typically between a size 4 and 6 and wouldve liked to try the size 6 to get more of a shift look.","There is comfortable room throughout so it would work great for any body type.","Since there is a low open back I would suggest going braless or wearing a nubra!"
"other","Love this dress: forgiving fabric with an interesting wave texture and I think a subtle gold thread running through it that makes it look special.","Im curvy and this dress laid very nicely.","Im planning to wear it to a work dinner and also a memorial."
"other","I tried this dress on at the NYC Henri Bendel showroom after my stylist handed it to me to try on.","I probably wouldnt have picked it out but I loved it!","Very flattering, and beautiful brocade fabric.","Since it was March, I paired it with leggings, boots, and a leather jacket for warmth and also to dress it down for the film screening I attended.","Id love to rent this dress again.","Update: I reviewed this dress months after I wore it.","I assumed I wore the 6, as usual.","But I never even rented a 6.","The size 4 fit great in the showroom and I took it with me."
"other","In my recent memory I havent had a dress that is this comfortable and this flattering!","With pockets no less!","I wore this dress to my engagement photos and it was picture perfect!","I measure 42 in the waist and 38 in the chest and the size 12 fit wonderfully.","Would love to rent again, but there are too many other dresses to explore!"
"other","Great for photos, especially if you are able to catch the wind.","Added a belt to highlight the waist.","Felt amazing in this gown.","Pros- the RED stands out and is great for pictures - it s generally flattering dress Cons (if I had to list) - the dress was 2 inches long for me.","I am 54 wearing 4 inch heels- the v neck was extremely low.","I had to pin it up and its still pretty low- the slit could be a bit higher so it shows a bit more leg SuggestionsOrder a second size smaller than your standard.","This dress fits large."
"other","I wore this to an auction my friend chaired.","It was simple and classic.","Fit great!","Could have sized down but the arms and chest would have been slightly uncomfortable.","Pockets would have sent this dress over the top.","A perfect and professional LBD."
"other","UNBELIEVABLE the photos do not do this dress justice.","Within 3 minuets of walking out of my hotel room I received a complement.","People continued to stop me all night long and ask me where I bought my dress.","I wore the 8 and I believe the 6 would have fit better, but it was still a SHOWSTOPPER.","I plan to rent this again for an upcoming trip to Vegas.","LOVE LOVE LOVED it!"
"other","Thoughts: I ordered both the 6 and the 8 (I float between sizes depending on the cut of a dress) and ended up wearing the 6.","As other reviewers mentioned, it is cut a bit on the shorter end.","Great if you arent hesitant to show some leg; not great if that isnt your thing.","The structured waist and lace cutouts gave me a great shape.","No bra needed.","I didnt have any issue with the lace overlay falling flat.","Would wear again!"
"other","I did get compliments but this dress wasnt a showstopper.","(They cant all be!)","Having said that, I dont regret renting this dress.","One nice thing is that this dress could serve a few purposes based on the size.","The dress did fit true to size but could also be more casual and flowy if you  order one size up.","If you want something super fitted and dramatic, order a size down.","This would be a great office holiday party dress but maybe not a sexy number for a Vegas night out."
"other","I rented this dress for my engagement photo session, and i loved it.","We didnt end up taking a lot of photos while wearing this dress but I would rent it again!","My only issue with the dress was that it was WAY too big on top so i had to use a lot of fashion tape to keep it up."
"other","I ordered the 12 & the 14 but ended up using the 14 because it fit SO well when I put it on!","This dress is absolutely stunning, I highly recommend it."
"other","I wore this for a latin dance event.","It was tight as I ordered a 4 when I should have stayed with the 6.","It zips up the side which is great and I wore a strapless bra with it.","There is a clasp that is snug and makes is so that you may be able to wear without a bra.","The flowy nature of the material and style made this a fun dress to wear.","Color was great too."
"other","Obsessed with this top!","So cute and fun.","I loved the detail and style of the top - especially the sleeves.","It runs true to size.","I would recommend going one size up for backup.","The fabric has no stretch but there is comfortable room throughout the midsection.","It’s straight at the waist.","Great for any cup size and should be worn with a strapless bra because of the lace.","Can make it dressy or casual.","Great for work or meeting up with friends, day or night.","Would definitely rent again!"
"other","The fabric has a beautiful sheen and interesting colors and pattern.","The right accessories really helped it pop.","I am usually between a size 2 and a size 4 and definitely needed a size 4 in this dress as it has no stretch or give to the material."
"other","This jacket fits snug, so you cant wear anything bulky underneath.","I paired it with a short black dress and a multi-strand pearl necklace for a fashion show fundraiser.","Didnt get as many compliments as I usually do with RTR items.","Maybe its better with a more casual look?"
"other","Definitely not for the small chested girls.","Which was precisely why I chose it and it was perfect.","I wore it with a velvet choker to soften the leather look and a side sweep faux hawk.","It was pretty jaw dropping."
"other","The dress runs small and because it had been cleaned several times, the outer layer had shrunk smaller than the lining so it was hanging down about 1.5 inches below the dress.","I called customer service and they were fantastic.","Apologized for the issue, adjusted the price, and suggested I use hem tape to fix.","I didnt think they would want me to alter the dress in any way and was really anticipating Id need to scramble to find something different.","I give their service an A+!"
"other","I really liked this white printed crepe jacquard.","Im usually a size 4 wearing a small, running true to size we recommend sizing up for back up if youre curvier and sizing down if youre smaller framed.","The bust area has stretch and ample room, allowing a fit for all cup sizes.","It is a fitted dress throughout the midsection with a very stretchy fabric.","At 56 hit me at mid thigh length.","I absolutely love the little slit on the side but for someone with an hourglass figure it was difficult to keep the dress from rising up.","With long sleeves and a crew neckline, this piece may be worn with a standard bra.","Great for a night out!"
"other","You can never go wrong with a jumpsuit & this one was perfect for a night out with a few of my friends!","Its stretchy which makes it comfy, the cutouts make it sexy without being too over the top and its just fun!","You can dress it up or down, wear heels or flats...your options are endless!","I will definitely be renting this in the white version also."
"other","The colors are much brighter in person.","I thought it was going to be more pastel.","With that said, I loved the dress.","I got a lot of compliments and really enjoyed the day.","(I wore the dress for my law school graduation).","The dress is of a modest length above the knee and the neck like was perfect.","It is made of good material and is thicker than I was imagining but I liked that because it didnt feel cheap.","All in all I love the dress and would consider purchasing it to keep!"
"other","I attended a prohibition-themed party in an old barn in Central California and I couldnt help but get this dress for it (even though there were other options more to theme).","I got SO many compliments that evening - it really made it unforgettable!","The neck line is out of my comfort zone so that was fun.","If you have any sort of boobies (I wear a b cup) it will reveal more skin than the model photo shows.","But I didnt mind - just wish I had a different bra to wear as I found myself revealing a bit too much (probably should have used some tape).","Fit: Im 55 so the length was perfect with some 4 heels.","It was snug around my ribs (mine are a bit large for my size) but not too tight and my booty fit right in there.","I want to say its true to size but I wore the 6L and Im usually an 8 - made me feel better anyways :)Wish I could wear this dress every day with all the compliments I got!"
"other","Tight in top.","Bottom just kissed the floor.","Sexy elegant dress."
"other","fits great, good structure...simple and can be accessorized up or down."
"other","It fit great, definitely looked better on than photographed.","Quality was beautiful, had a nice swish to it.","However, I just felt frumpy in it.","I will edit this review later if I can find a pic to post.","It was perfectly appropriate for my sons college graduation but I probably would not rent it again just because of the frumpy factor."
"other","I rented this dress for my 8th grade promotion (graduation ceremony) and dance.","It fit me very well, it was really crisp, and the colors were much more vibrant than in the online picture.","The fabric was nice and thick, and even though I wore it on a hot summer night I wasnt too hot.","The zipper was very frustrating, though.","The zipper on the size 0 would not go up, but the 2 looked the same in regards to the rest of the dress, but the zipper went up much easier.","The pockets were very nice to hold a lip gloss and my iPhone 4s with an Otterbox case on it.","It seems like it would also be able to hold a phone an inch or so bigger than that.","Overall, the dress was beautiful and it was a great rental!"
"other","Tried this on in the showroom in white and it was really pretty and looked a little edgy given some styling changes.","The red didnt look as special in person.","Fabric felt kinda thin, its not lined (in either color).","If I recall the sleeves were longer than necessary as well.","Thought the white was awesome, the red didnt do much.","Also more orangey-red than blue-red."
"other","It runs big and has a turtle neck - it will keep you warm but also cool while dancing on stage under strobe lights."
"other","I didnt have to wear a bra with this backless dress.","No tape or cups either.","The fabric worked well enough that I could go braless"
"other","I had a very important event and could not find anything in the stores that I liked or wanted, so I rented this dress VERY last minute.","It came right on time- just three days after I had placed my order.","I chose sizes 6 & 8, and I went with my usual size 6.","I was really happy with this dress, and it made my important event much less stressful!","RTR is now my default for all events I attend- next up, my sisters college graduation!","Thank you RTR!","!"
"other"," It is a lot more silvery than it appears in the photos.","It fit true to size and was a great length for a petite person.","I got a size smaller for backup which was tight in the chest, but overall I would say get the smaller size as a backup - this has no stretch at all."
"other","This dress was gorgeous - from far away.","It fit well and looked amazing, but definitely had a lot of wear and tear.","The bottom and back seams were totally floppy, and the fabric had a lot of pilling all over.","(Photo attached of pilling) :( From far away it looked amazing though!"
"other","This dress was fun and sooo comfortable.","It wasnt fitted at all, even in the smallest size.","I liked it, but it wasnt quite as sexy on me as on the super tall model :)I went bra-less, but it would probably look better with a strapless."
"other","I got so many compliments on this dress.","I wore it for Easter.","It is a nice mint color with splashes of blue.","So when I first got the dress I was a little worried because when I first put it on it was difficult to get into.","Ladies, you will need some form of spanx or undergarment that will create a smooth effect.","The material is like a scuba suit and it is fitted.","The arms are a little snug, but once you move around it will stretch a little.","The length hit right above my knee.","I paired this awesome dress with nude heels and a mint/green colored necklace.","If you are comfortable with wearing fitted dresses but still having a classy look, this dress is for you.","I loved it!","!"
"other","A little big but really comfortable.","Material is really pretty in person.","Lots of texture.","Would rent again."
"other","I loved the bright orange color.","My only problem was that the straps kept slipping off my shoulders and the slip underneath was a bit restrictive, but nothing I could work around.","Its a fun and pretty dress to wear!"
"other","This dress fabric is so cute and fun!","I was instantly drawn to this dress because of the fun fabric that its made from.","Almost vintage in feel and texture, this dress is truly a unique piece in an otherwise common A-line style.","The fit was great as well, although the middle is a bit tight so busier or curvier women should size up for their backup.","A standard bra could definitely be worn with this style as well.","This look would be great for a summer wedding or a daytime event.","However, I would note also that this fabric is heavier than it looks, so I wouldnt wear it when the temperature is overly hot."
"other","This dress received SO many compliments!","Any time I am surprised by getting to wear the smaller of two dress sizes, thats a good day.","I ordered the size 4 and size 2 in this dress, as Im usually a size 4.","However, glad I ordered both sizes, as I actually ended up wearing the size 2, which was still VERY comfortable yet much more flattering than the four.","The dress is not overly tight, but is form fitting.","The details are beautiful on the dress, and really didnt require anything else to be added.","I wore a simple pearl bracelet and earrings, but a necklace was completely unnecessary.","Due to it being a colder day, I wore black pantyhose, but could be a nice spring dress with lighter heels and no pantyhose.","LOVED the dress!"
"other","The dress fit great, the size 12 would have worked a bit better, but the zipper was stuck so I went with the size 14.","I didnt have to worry about eating too much though :) A great length, Im 60 and it was about mid-thigh, not too short for an evening holiday cocktail party.","Got lots of compliments on the back bow as well!"
"other","This is would be a great style for a bridal shower/luncheon/rehearsal dinner.","The lace is beautiful and is a thick layer for the overlay.","The arms were a little tight, when I raised them up, but it was very comfortable, other than that.","The slip, underneath is very soft and not too tight.","Though, it may look like you can wear a standard bra with this style, the straps will show, so I suggest wearing a strapless bra or a nude bra, if you need straps.","the length hit me right at the knee, so if youre shorter than 54, if may feel a littler longer than youd like.","This is a simple yet elegant style!"
"other","Great dress for the office!","I love the way Draper James fits.","This runs true to size - I would size up for your backup.","There is comfortable room in the bust and works well with any bust size.","A standard bra may be worn as well.","The natural waist is fitted but there is a loose fit in the hips.","This comes to about 2 inches above the knee on a 54 person."
"other","I rented this dress for a friends rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.","It was the perfect blend of casual enough for the outside rehearsal and dressy enough to wear to the nice restaurant for dinner.","I got so many compliments!","The only thing I didnt like was having to return it."
"other","The dress was definitely tight at the chest but I made it work.","My back up size 12R would have been perfect but it was damaged prior to being shipped to me and thus I got another dress that I didnt like.","I wore it with heels (3 heels) and it was fine (I am 57).","The fabric was heavy.","The detailing was beautiful.","Overall, the dress was gorgeous albeit a little tight."
"other","I wore this to my boyfriends law school graduation.","Extremely flattering fit- I have a small chest size and frame and it gave me some curve!","The dress definitely runs small so order a size up.","The material is thick.","The color is stunning and the length was perfect, which is something I usually have an issue with being 58.","I would order again!"
"other","The dress isnt the most comfortable since the sequence were thick and heavy.","The mid section is not very forgiving is you have a pooch belly.","I definitely had to use spanx to give a smoother look.","Overall the color was fabulous and fitting for an evening at the theater to see the Nutcracker."
"other","Perfect dress to wear to a Sunday brunch with friends!","I love the lace overlay on this dress complete with the bell sleeve.","A great length for me at 54 with plenty of room in the bust.","Although there is little stretch in the fabric this dress is not fitted in the waist or hip area.","The slip underneath does have a deep v-neck and is fairly sheer so I would recommend a Nu Bra with this dress for sure!","You can dress this look up with a wedge heel or go for a casual look with cute ballerina flat!"
"other","this dress was SO flattering on!!","I love the fit and flare shape with the pretty beading on top.","The top section of this dress does not stretch and runs small- Im normally a 0 and wore the 2 and found it to be comfortable (it did fit more like a 0).","I would get your normal size and then a size up for backup, especially if youre bigger in the bust!","Loved the length on this too, this would be really fun for a holiday party.","Super flattering- must rent!"
"other","I wore this gown for my Christmas card photo & the pictures turned out just as I imaged they would.","Ive already ordered a new set of dresses and Im looking forward to the next perfect fit!"
"other","This was a backup dress to the Lets Get Loud dress that I also rented and did end up wearing (AWESOME DRESS).","However, I tried on this dress to see if I could rent it again in the future and yes I would consider it... however it flattened out my chest slightly and the purple was more of a mauve and faded a little this is why I docked one star.","I am sure they have several of these dresses so?"
"other","I rented this dress for a nice dinner that my fiance was invited to at the Four Seasons.","It went a little past my knee, but I expected that since Im on the shorter side.","No need to wear a bra which was also helpful.","It was classy and sexy without being over the top or too formal."
"other","now for me, i need length to the knee because of my thick legs but the fit was effortless and i also sized down, 6 instead of 8, but im petite and completely hourglass.","it wasnt as itchy as i thought because its very lightweight and flowy."
"other","As others have described, the best thing about this dress is that it has lots of hooks to keep it securely in place.","Everything was covered appropriately :)."
"other","I loved the material of this dress, it moved with me so easily and as such was incredibly comfortable.","The cut was super flattering and the pockets were another great feature.","I got compliments on the dress all night long!","My only complaint is that I had to send it back!","FABULOUS dress!"
"other","I was afraid that being 35 weeks pregnant, I wasnt going to be able to fit in the size I ordered.","The reviews seemed to say that it ran large so that is why I ordered only a size larger than my non pregnant size.","It fit like a glove!","I would have to say that if I wasnt pregnant, I would agree that it runs large but for my current size it fit PERFECT.","The length was great too!","I was able to wear flats and it barely brushed the ground.","AMAZING dress...."
"other","Cute and comfortable!","Running true to size, we recommend sizing up for back up.","This dress is great for any cup size since there is comfortable room in the bust.","The waist is fitted.","The stretchy fabric allows for a comfortable fit throughout the midsection.","There is definitely comfortable room in the hips.","At 58, this dress hit slightly above my knees.","Standard undergarments can be worn with this dress.","The style is great to wear to church or a family brunch.","Pair it with black heels and either pearls or a bright statement necklace."
"other","fit true to size; im a 0P and it fit exactly the way I hoped it would.","A tiny bit long, but it didnt look bad--it appeared as if I had a train on the gown and it made the dress that much more beautiful.","Fantastic dress I would absolutely rent again!"
"other","I love how unique this dress is.","The hem of this dress is so much fun!","I am wearing a size six in the photo and it does fit true to size.","I do recommend curvier women going a size up for their backup size.","The dress was not fitted in my midsection, waist or hips.","The dress is great for any cup size.","I am a 36D and felt very comfortable in the dress.","This dress can be worn with a standard bra.","I am 5’9” and the dress was mid-thigh length on me.","This dress would be perfect for a night out with a pair of heels.","It can also be worn casually to work with a pair of flats."
"other","Im busty, so I automatically ordered a larger size since the pricier designers tend to use less material.","I read the reviews about the zipper being an issue, which was definitely the case.","It kept getting caught in the same location.","I had to lay on my stomach with little pressure on that area in order for my husband to zip me up.","But the dress and the photos were a hit."
"other","snug fita few strings hanging from dress"
"other","I just LOVED everything about this dress!","I wore it to the Beyonce concert so because of the length I had to be very careful not to raise my arms too high.","Its short!","The colors and fabric are beautiful.","I received several compliments and felt absolutely gorgeous."
"other","I wore this dress for my sons christening and I LOVED it!!","Compliments all day... hubby asked if we could buy it from RTR:)  I felt so great in it all day.","The color is stunning especially in sunlight.","It is a heavier material so I would not recommend this in warm weather since it was a cooler day and I was feeling warm in it.","But otherwise, stunning dress, I cannot give it enough stars!"
"other","Wore this for a bachelorette party and really loved it.","I usually wear a 2 or 4 and the 4 was snug on me.","The sleeves are really tight and I have pretty thin arms.","I would recommend sizing up if possible.","the quality is great and I love the style."
"other","I didnt end up wearing this due to a change in plans, but loved the dress and would consider renting again.","Im glad I listened to other reviews and got a smaller size as backup because it definitely runs large.","Im usually a 6 and the 4 fit perfectly.","I liked that it had pockets, but if they are not laying just right then they can make your midsection look poofy."
"other"," Because of my height, my biggest concern is always if a dress will be long enough.","This one was perfect, hitting above the  knee but not inappropriately short.","I did not find the sleeves to be too tight like some reviewers did.","I am pretty fit but more muscular/athletic than thin, if that helps at all.","Also I am around a 34D and it fit in the bust.","I would recommend this for any body type."
"other","Comfortable over sized fit.","Go down for back up.","A strapless bra is a must!"
"other","I was not able to wear it to the event because it was just too big.","I usually wear a 6 or an 8, but i definitely could have fit into a 4, if not smaller."
"other","I wore this dress to the Opera - it was a hit.","I had two separate ladies come up to me and to compliment me!","I am a curvy girl (size 8 with hips) and I loved the way I looked in this dress.","It showed off my curves without being too much.","It does fit a little snug and I would recommend wearing some sort of spanx if you are worried about not having a smooth appearance."
"other","The dress is perfect for the summer!","You can dress it up or down and the fit is just ideal.","You can wear a standard bra with this dress and no need for Spanx as it doesnt cling to any par of your body...even the middle section that may look tight is not; its elastic and very soft elastic at that.","A must rent!!","!"
"other","This dress is everything I hoped for and more.","On top of the countless compliments I received from friends and strangers, the dress is perfect for taller ladies, myself being 511.","Im built average with a lot more to love in the thigh/butt region and a size 8 fit perfect.","I didnt feel like I was falling out of it.","Very elegant, classy and timeless.","Also pockets?!?!","Cannot go wrong with pockets!"
"other","I wore this for my senior high school prom & I received lots of compliments.","I was worried that it would be too plain but it was quite the opposite.","The simplicity of the dress and rich color, makes it easy to accessorize and make it your own.","The cut out and slit are the perfect way to add a little edge without being over the top.","I am 52 so the dress did drag a little on the floor even with 3 inch heels, so wouldnt recommend the L unless you are really tall or wearing super high heels.","No bra necessary because of the thick secure material, and this is coming from someone who wears bras with everything.","It does run a little small so I say a size up is your safest bet.","Before placing your order, I would recommend trying on the dress or any dress thats similar from the designer to know what size to order and how itll look.","Overall, it is a beautiful dress that really made my prom night special and I was sad to have to return it.","I would 100% recommend this dress and Rent The Runway!"
"other","A fun rental of a floaty feminine dress.","There is a midnight blue slip that you layer on first and then pop on the printed overall.","Its lovely.","I would recommend a sandal to compliment its lightweight feel."
"other","I rented this dress for a rehearal dinner and loved it.","It was very comfortable and casual.","Yet, the sleeves dressed it up and overall is was super cute.","I didnt get a good picture while wearing it, but I posted the only one I took.","I typically wear a size 2 and thats the size I wore in this dress.","I ordered a 0 for backup.","That dress fit as well, but I went with the more comfortable fit in the size 2.","You cant tell from the picture I posted, but the sleeves were really cute on the dress.","I would recommend getting a necklace to wear with it since it is a solid color dress that starts high on the neck.","I would love to wear this same dress again."
"other","The dress came with the tags on so that was a plus!, i am very tiny and slender.","This dress was a 0 and it still hung on me.","maybe a 00 wouldve fit me better.","The material is perfect and it flows, not itchy or too thick, great for work and its very neat looking dress"
"other","I am 6 months postpartum and struggled finding a dress that would fit my mid section and my chest.","Im currently nursing so I still am rather large on top yet small on the bottom which makes dress finding a task.","This dress did great with that.","I did find the straps to be loose so I had to use tape to ensure my top half was covered and the zipper is a pain (had to have help to get in and out) but overall I liked the dress and would get again if a sparkly dresses was needed."
"other","I rented this dress for an all-day event in the sun (golf tournament) and it was perfect - the dress was so comfortable and I got so many compliments.","The material was light, so it was perfect in the heat.","I would say that the sizing probably runs a little bit larger - I usually would have guessed that I wear a Small, but when I tried the dresses on I preferred the XS due to the looseness in the arm holes (on the sides of my chest)."
"other","I rented this dress for my daughters baptism and it was perfect!","Conservation but still flattering v-neck, gorgeous and comfortable a-line.","I loved the thicker fabric for the fall and not having to worry about needing a jacket as well.","It fit true to size and was such an easy choice.","I highly recommend!"
"other","I live in SF, so nothing is super fancy, but also its nice to look nice, and this dress fit the bill.","It fit in at the symphony, a couple michelin star restaurants, and a women in tech conference to promote my startup (VINA.io).... so it can go fairly casual but also get dressed up for a nice event depending if you add a denim jacket fancy up with accessories and cute shoes.","The fit is fantastic.","Heads up though - because of the cutouts, you cant wear a bra.","The fabric is really thick though, so you can go braless without a lot of notice.","OH - AND IT HAS POCKETS!","!"
"other","I absolutely loveeee this dress.","It fit me JUST LIKE THE MODEL.","Very true to size.","So edgy and trendy I wish I could have kept it!"
"other","I rented this for my engagement pictures and it was perfect!!","It was tighter fitting and the material was on the thicker side (no bra needed!)","It was jut the right length and it looked great with the earrings I rented as well.","It was really easy to dress up and down when we moved locations from a wine bar to the beach.","BUTTT it does run very small - definitely go a size up from your usual."

"other","Beautiful color!","Slightly long for me."
"other","The dress was extremely comfortable and fit perfectly.","I was worried about the pleated skirt, but it looked great in person.","The dress was conservative enough and the peephole could be easily covered in pictures by adjusting the fabric.","This fit true to Shoshanna sizing and I went with the size 2.","The 0 would have fit, but the 2 was more comfortable."
"other","The dress mostly worked out.","My favorite detail was the length - which was perfect!","Im not quite 55 and wore 2.5 inch heels.","Most gowns tend to be way too long but the regular length hit the tops of my heels, and had a nice little train in the back.","Tall girls should get the long version!","The cons were the knot in the front.","I didnt realize it would be so bulky and seemed to add  to my midsection (which is a little round already) Im also high waist-ed, so it hit me slightly at an odd place.","The color is a very light blush (not pink, or peach, but also not purely champagne)  I wore a stick-on bra and probably should have gotten the padded version to fill out the top a bit more.","Overall loved it - dress looked great under lights for my concert."
"other","I can gush about every detail of this dress.","I cant believe I almost didnt rent it!","The pattern reads great in person (and in photos) especially with a statement necklace.","It can be dressed up or down, and worn in multiple seasons.","The fabric is structured, but with some give, so I never felt stuffed into it.","It is high quality- but rents for a steal.","The lines of this dress are super flattering.","Did I mention there are pockets?","And they sit slightly on the front so do not give a extra bulk on the hips.","I was beyond happy with this dress and will rent again.","Actually, I will  be on the look out to buy this one!"
"other","This dress definitely runs large so go with a size down.","I was worried about doing this because I have large hips and butt, however I had no problems fitting into the smaller size.","The asymmetrical design of the cut-outs makes this dress really different and unique.","I was worried about not wearing a bra since the back is see-through, but the fabric was thick enough so it wasnt a problem."
"other","Wore it to a Taylor Swift concert - totally inspired by her 1989 tour look.","The sheer material was great and sexy enough for me but not too offensive to be surrounded by little girls.","Couldve worn the XS but the fit around my legs looked better with the extra wriggle room in the S."
"other","There were no more 4r available so I had no choice than to get the 4L and it was supper long but I just wore it with higher heels so it wasnt a big deal."
"other","I used this dress to take engagement photos on the beach.","The dress flowed really nicely, but wasnt my original choice, RTR sent it as a backup when my original became unavailable.","I probably would not rent again as I thought it was a weird inbetween style- sort of casual and sort of dressy.","It would work well for  day time wedding.","I thought the dress ran large and ended up showing my bra in the back since it sagged on one side.","It does have a little line of silicon to help hold it up normally."
"other","I wore this dress to a fraternity formal, and it was absolutely perfect.","My boyfriends jaw literally dropped when I walked in the room.","Better yet, I felt SO comfortable in this dress.","Even though I have a bigger bust, this dress kept me supported and had just the right amount of cleavage.","Im tall with a booty, and I didnt have to keep pulling the dress down.","I danced all night without having to worry, and felt like a million bucks."
"other","I love this adorable  printed red jacquard Amanda Uprichard piece!","It is a perfect date night dress.","This piece runs true to size but for a backup size, Id recommend sizing up in most cases especially if you have a curvier figure since the hips are more fitted.","This fabric has no stretch but with comfortable room at bust, it is great for any cup size  and may be worn with a standard bra.","Im usually not a fan of cap or short sleeve but this was super flatting.","I absolutely love the pretty back with a little bit of ruffle!","At 56, it hit mini to mid thigh, I recommend pairing it with minimal jewelry and some black heels."
"other","The dress was a little itchy from the sequins, although there is a lining on the inside, my arms were slightly irritated by the end of the evening.","I dont have many curves and the dress was grazing the ground, which made walking up and down stairs particularly difficult.","The cowl back hangs low, so you cant wear a conventional bra without it showing.","I would not recommend this dress for anyone who has a large bust that needs to be supported.","I was able to step in and out of the dress, I cant even remember if it had a zipper.","If it did, I didnt use it.","I recommend ordering the size you think you are, and a size down as the alternate.","With those considerations in mind, I got a lot of compliments on this dress from both men and women.","Its hard to miss a gold sequined gown, so if you want to be the center of attention, this dress is for you."
"other","Vacation, anyone?","I absolutely adored this dress, I didnt want to give it back!","It has such an effortless flow to it, and the print is so chic.","It is not fitted, so it provides comfortable room for fuller hips and bust.","I would suggest sizing down as a backup if youd like a bit of a tighter fit.","However, the overall look of this dress is very loose, flowy and bohemian.","This dress is great for any body type.","The ruffle skirt is so unique and really adds charm to the dress.","I would pair this with strappy sandals during the day, and nude heels for a night out on the town."
"other","A lovely slinky gown by Yigal Azrouel!","Channel a Bond girl with this figure-flattering dress; the fabric is very stretchy and comfortable.","At 60, the Regular length was a few inches short.","I am typically a 6L, however the 4R was the perfect fit throughout.","I recommend sizing down for your backup size.","Wear a strapless bra with this one, and pair it with modern metallic accessories."
"other","The hem tended to ride up a bit with movement.","This might be fixed with a larger size or a different figure."
"other","Super comfortable dress!","Running true to size, we recommend sizing down for backup as I did find this dress ran a little big on me.","The fabric does have some stretch to it and the flowy fabric definitely gives it a boho vibe.","This dress would work for any bust size however due to the front lace cutout a standard bra may show a little.","There is comfortable room throughout the waist and hips.","At 54 the regular length hit right to the floor with about 3-4 heels.","Perfect for work or a casual daytime event!"
"other","I rented for the first time for my sisters 21st.","The dress was gorgeous, and fit well, but I think I may have been more comfortable in a medium.","Surprisingly, the bust was not an issue for me.","In fact, I think a medium may have been a little too big in the arm openings.","However, the skirt of the dress is very narrow through the hips.","If I were a tall, leggy type, I would need a bigger size to counteract the riding up.","Luckily, Im short, so I wasnt showing much.","I got all kinds of compliments from all kinds of people throughout the night!"
"other","The fit is comfortable and so flattering; plus has pockets!","Photos dont do justice for the color as its so awesome and unique.","My daughter was able to dance the night away feeling beautiful with no complications or wardrobe issues.","And it has pockets!","She did not feel comfortable with the neckline being so low, although it wasnt bad, so she wore a bando under it.","This did not take away from how amazing she looks in this dress."
"other","This dress actually fit me well except it was a little large along the bust line for me.","I was planning to wear this to my youngest sons Senior Dinner when I came down with the Norovirus.","There was no way I could go anywhere.","One of the saddest days of my life as I had worked on the Senior Video for 9 months and wasnt able to be there to watch it."
"other","Super cute Trina Turk dress!","I am typically not a fan of  bright colors since I do have very fair skin however I was pleasantly surprised with this style.","It runs very true to size however I would recommend sizing up for the backup size.","Due to the thin straps I would suggest sticking with a strapless bra or going braless!","It is form fitting at the waist however due to the fit and flare style there is comfortable room at the hips.","Perfect for a daytime event!"
"other","Confidence and compliments!!","Loved the lace detail and the way I felt while wearing this dress.","Running true to size, we recommend going one size up for back up.","This dress works best for A to C cup sizes because it is fitted at the bust.","This dress should be worn with either a NuBra or no bra because the back is sheer.","The style is fitted, but the stretchy fabric allows for a comfortable fit throughout your midsection.","Curvier women with fuller hips should consider sizing up.","At 58, the dress hit slightly below my knees.","This style is great to wear to either parties or weddings.","I definitely did not want to return this dress!","Pair with black heels.","Accessorize with a cute gold clutch."
"other","Its hard to find a dress that fits me perfectly but this one did!","Literally fit like a glove!","Wore it to an event with lot of fashion celebrities, coworkers, and my boss.l and got so many compliments  that night.","It might get a bit hot when you wear it but otherwise a good choice for a gala/ formal dress"
"other","This dress fit great and was the perfect length (I wore it with flats but a small heel could have worked as well).","The colors of the flowers really pop against the gray background.","The fabric was super soft and very lightweight.","I wore this for an engagement photo shoot and because of the slit the bottom has a lot of movement, which was perfect.","It can be dressed up or dressed down, so overall I thought it was perfect.","Oh, and the cut outs were tasteful, not too big but still noticeable."
"other","I wore this one night during my Bachelorette weekend and it was perfect.","You cant wear a bra with it but I have a small chest so wasnt bothered by this.","I did wear the smaller size (Size 0) because the 2 was a little too big on my shoulders.","I am only 50 so the length was just fine for me.","Really loved this dress!","So classy and with a dash of bridal in the blush pink hue.",":)"
"other","I wore this dress to my bridal shower and loved it!","The color is beautiful and I loved the lace.","Im very tall so the torso was a bit short, but its hard to find a dress where that is not the case."
"other","I was worried that the 16 would be too large, but it was pretty tight.","I couldve worn it, but felt more comfortable in the 18.","So glad I had the backup size.","This dress is very comfortable and flattering.","The color is bright and the fabric was soft.","I wore with nude heels for an Easter brunch.","It was perfect.","I ordered the recommended earrings, which were absurdly beautiful.","They were a little too much bling for my occasion, so I ultimately didnt wear them."
"other","The dress was a perfect fit for me.","I loved everything about this dress from the detailing, to the cut and shape, to the fabric, to the length, to the color, etc.","I received several compliments on this dress.","I didnt even wear jewelry because I felt the details of the dress were beautiful on their own.","I recommend this dress, especially to those with hour glass figures as it accents the narrow waist."
"other","This dress was so pretty in person!","Its definitely more red than orange like in the picture, but its very vibrant and pretty.","If youre tall it is a bit short when you sit down.","Like some of the other reviews mention, it is fairly tight in the chest so beware of that when picking your size.","I highly recommend this dress- youll stand out!"
"other","The fabric was light and moved beautifully when I walked or twirled, and the color really POPS in photos.","Thinking I was a 4, I rented a size 4 and a 2 just in case, and didnt really measure before.","I think I am actually between at 0 and a 2 from being on a new workout regimen .","Luckily the 2 came as a second dress free of charge (THANKS RTR!).","I still had to wear 2 bras to keep the dress up.","Lesson - take your measurements and dont guess based on previous sizes ;)"
"other","The dress was a beautiful dress for a fancy Easter brunch.","I felt very comfortable in this dress and loved how fancy and feminine it looked.","The color was such a soft shade but just enough color to show through the lace.","Im a bit short waisted so the torso didnt quite fit.","It did cover my hips and the length of the skirt was perfect and so was the flow of the skirt, and pockets!","!"
"other","I did order size XS and S to my dismay (or perhaps too much pasta) i had to get a rush on M for my event day.","THANK YOU to RTR for such amazing service - they made it happen."

"other","pros: classic yet sexy at the same time.","great material and very comfortable!","the black color was very flattering as wellthe only con i have for this dress is the length...had to keep pulling it down because it was too short, but i am 511 so that was probably a big factor!"
"other","Purchased dress"
"other","I rented this for my birthday celebration and adored it!","I found it fit TTS.","The material is flowy and stretchy, so theres forgiveness in all areas of the dress...making it the perfect dress to hide that post-boozy brunch food-baby.","I loved the cutouts on the side, it added some flair to the dress.","I got stopped a few times and complimented on the dress, its a a fun one!","Its a little long, so I wore wedge sandals to keep the edge of the dress off the floor.","Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
"other","Wore the dress with a very elaborate necklace.","It was stunning.","Sorry, no picture."
"other","This dress fit perfectly.","I ordered both a M and L size for some extra wiggle room, but went with the M size.","I LOVE this.","I couldnt ask for a better dress as I celebrated the last night of my bachelorette weekend.","LOVE this!"
"other","I had the incredible opportunity to meet Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffet in this dress so confidence was everything.","The dress fit perfectly in place, not a lot of fuss or pulling it down into place, was the perfect length and the open clavicle spots kept the dress professional without being boring.","Felt great every moment while I was wearing it."
"other","Its difficult to tell from the other pics, but the fabric is a mid-weight with a bit of texture to it.","Its perfect for autumn, but I think it would be a bit heavy for spring and summer.","Ive rented it twice now, and I always receive rave reviews.","Its flattering and easy to wear.","I wore a size smaller than my usual size."
"other","Unfortunately, I did not end up wearing this dress to my prom... however, it is so beautiful and fit perfectly.","The fabric was so pretty and the dress moved with me.","I usually wear a size 4 and the 4R fit me perfectly.","I tried the dress on with flats and the 4R was the perfect length -- had I decided to wear heels, I would have needed the 4L."
"other","Dress had some stretch to it and fabric was thick enough to make it comfortable to wear.","True to size.","I wore it to a black tie college sports banquet.","Liked the dress a lot.","Its a great LBD."
"other","Loved the vibrant color of this dress.","The pictures dont quite do it justice on how good it looked.","Im 59 138lbs 34DD and the 6 fit perfectly.","The dress is sexy but totally proper with the high lace neck.","The slip ends above the knee so you can see a bit of leg through the lace at the bottom.","Was going to wear this to a wedding, but ended up wearing to my 1st anniversary dinner.","This dress can be dressed up to be very formal, or more for fun party depending on how you style it."
"other","Comfortable Chic Cutout with Class.","I loved this!!!","Tip: I wouldnt recommend tying the sash in a bow, it just ruins the lines of the dress/jumpsuit.","Instead opt for a more obi knot and pin it (I was having to readjust the knot all night).","Honestly thinking about purchasing this one.","Enjoy!"
"other","A little tight in the hips but otherwise fit perfect"
"other","I ordered a size up and it was too big.","I am a 36D and the top was still really large and the straps are better suited for someone with a longer torso.","Overall the dress is beautiful!","Love the pockets, the waist lays perfectly and the pleats arent so outrageous that it gives an unflattering poofy look.","I will absolutely order this again but in my true size."
"other","the jumper fits great!","the high belted waist is slenderizing and perfect if you are generally toned but might want to hide a little tummy (post-kids or otherwise).","loved the pockets!","it is super comfortable although I will agree with others that it is difficult to use the restroom without feeling  you are completely undressed.","my suggestion is it works well for shorter events where you can minimize that issue."
"other","I ended up not wearing this, though it was so comfortable in the top and waist, and very cute.","Im 54 and the legs were a bit long for me.","Im a runner and have more athletic calves and the legs fit so snugly over my calves that it looked funny.","Moral of the story, if you have more athletic calves this may not work out too well."
"other","Wore this for my engagement pictures, which we did partially on the beach at sunset.","The color was magnificent, and I loved the way the dress caught the wind a bit.","Im a busy gal with some curves, and I think it was pretty flattering.","You can also wear it with a normal bra!","The dress also comes in red and a watercolor pattern, if blue isnt your hue.","Great rental, would rent again."
"other","I really liked this dress: it fits well, pretty fabric and is really flattering on.","Its great for a less formal occasion.","Its very easy to wear."
"other","This is a looser sweater type dress, it clearly has some wear (like Im not totally certain if the dark is black or navy and the light is kind of discolored) but I wore it with black tights and boots on a cold day and it still looked cute.","Good option if you have gained a few pounds over the holidays!","Oh and it was a bit shorter than I was expecting - I would not wear it without tights Im 51 and it hit mid to upper thigh."
"other","The only drawback was that I couldnt wear a regular strapless bra with the side cutouts."
"other","Could have used a size down, but it wasnt in stock.","This dress was so comfy, looked fantastic and I got tons of compliments on it.","Wore with nude heels and some funky jewelry.","The event was my sons Bar Mitzvah."
"other","I wanted something comfortable, trendy and fun to bar hop with the 29 yr old bride and friends.","This definitely met all my expectations.","The fit is true to size and I didnt have any issues with the arms being tight.","I wore neutral block heel sandals to finish the look and recieved lots of compliments.","The fabric was great and the color was vibrant and not at all pleather like as depicted in the pics."
"other","This dress definitely hugs in the right places.","I ordered a 4 and probably would have been more comfortable in a 6.","It was a little tight when sitting but not uncomfortable.","The details on the dress -- amazing!","Definitely a one of a kind!"
"other","The material was soft and it wasnt itchy at all!","The dress looked delicate but it was actually nice and I the lace didnt get caught with anything.","The length was perfect and based on previous photos from previous renters I wore my boots with it and it looked perfect with hair pulled back.","I got so many compliments on how unique the dress was designed!"
"other","this jumpsuit is really chic, but not worth the $95 dollars.","the outfit i received had been worn so many times the chest detail was separating from the hidden bra underneath, so the entire bra part showed.","i had to use fashion tape just to keep the top from popping out/sliding down.","When you sit down, the crease that goes along the front will poof out and looked terrible.","had rented this for my graduation, and good thing i got a different back up outfit because it was not nearly nice enough for the event."
"other","Love this dress.","Beautiful, different and received compliments all evening.","I love Kate Spade!"
"other","Pros: the dress was BEAUTIFUL!","The picture definitely justifies how pretty it is.","The back is amazing, but you need to have a small bust b/c you canNOT wear a bra with it at all.","cons: I am pear shaped (a size 0, but still pear).","Bottom is bigger than my top.","a 2 fit well on my bottom but was way too big on the top so i wore the 0. it was a little tight and rode up a bit, but it looked good while i was standing there !","Overall loved the dress.","A perfect miss of classy and sexy!"
"other","This style runs a little larger, even with the belt.","The lace is soft and comfortable.","The color is great and much more striking in person!","Youll definitely stand out in this style!","The length is a little longer in person, so shorter women should beware of that.","There is plenty of room in the bust, but its a great style for full busted ladies.","I do suggest wearing a strapless bra, though.The mesh at the bottom is a fun touch, too!","I think this is a really great style!"
"other","I generally wear an 8 or a 10 but per the recommendation I ordered a 10 with a 12 as a back up.","My body type is definitely not thin but to small to be fat... round it all of with the fact I am short (411), busty, with a booty.","I am a 43 G, so the dress was a lil tight in the bust area but thats expected with all my clothes so I wasnt uncomfortable.","I could zip up the 10 but since I order this dress for a religious convention where I would be sitting down for 8hrs , getting in and out of a van and walking around, and taking pictures, the 10 was a bit too tight, so I went with the 12 which gave me a lil more wiggle room.","The color is beautiful, the embroidered flowers are a nice touch.","I felt beautiful and received a lot of compliments.","The dress is a classy fit yet stunning.","I recommend a size up to have some breathing room if you will be sitting down, but overall a great dress for a special event without being overly formal."
"other","I ordered this dress (and a second different dress) for a floral-themed gala fundraiser.","While both fit perfectly, this one was the clear winner.","The gorgeous fabric and design with floral details on the bodice and a full skirt (with pockets) made for a show-stopping dress that was also very comfortable to wear.","(Helpful hint - while I could easily have gone without a bra, I chose to wear a strapless one to give me a little more shape up top.)","I added a little color by wearing red heels and carrying a red and black evening bag.","The event was a fundraiser which started with a cocktail hour and silent auction and even in the crowded room, people were seeking me out to tell me how much they loved my dress.","I dont know when Ive received that many compliments (all from complete strangers) in one night on what I was wearing.","If I could purchase this dress, I would but as a minimum, I will likely rent it again for another event."
"other","Beautiful dress, hugs your curves.","It is great for an event where you would like to look sexy but professional."
"other","The dress fit perfectly.","I wore this dress to church.","I paired it with a black open cardigan and black heels.","The dress hit above my knees.","I wore a multi way bra because of the way the dress is cut at the top.","I just dont like for my bra straps to show.","There are clips inside the dress by the shoulders that may stop your bra strap from showing if that is what those are for.","It is a very comfortable dress and had a nice spring flair."
"other","This dress runs true to size, however, go up one for backup.","The bust is fitted so it may work better for A-C cup sizes.","A strapless bra is necessary since the top will show some skin.","Overall the dress is fitted...espcially at the natural waist."
"other","This dress keeps everything in place, it is comfortable and gets a lot of attention, I would definitely rent it again."
"other","This dress was AH-MAZ-ING!","It fit like a custom.","I wore it for our quarterly banquet for business and it could not have looked more perfect.","There are pockets but the do not flare as some pockets do.","The arms were cut slim but allowed for movement.","The raw lace edge was beautiful.","The dress was a jaw dropper - I had so many compliments!"
"other","The pantsuit was a perfect fit and material.","Even though, Im a size 10, I still got the 12 to achieve a loose fit.","It was beautiful."
"other","The only reason I did not rate the dress higher was because it was not fancy enough for a fashion show.","It is a nice dress and fits perfectly.","I was looking for something unique to wear to a fashion show.","The dress was not a wow like I had hoped based on the online pictures.","The top of the dress is nice.","The bottom is plain black.","It makes a great dress for a party.","I am a 36DD and was a bit uncomfortable with the slits in the front.","It did cause everyone to look, but was not distasteful."
"other","Fit is true to size.","Its a comfortable dress that is classy!"
"other","The fit was large, particularly the sleeves were a bit long and loose.","I will rent this again in a smaller size."
"other","I wore this dress to church with my family and loved it!","The design is simple enough for church or a nice family dinner, etc, but the material is fancy enough that I could have easily worn it to a wedding or other semi-formal event."
"other","I wore this to a bridal shower (dont worry its mint green, not a light color) and I got a lot of compliments on it.","Im short and it was REALLY long, I wore it anyway and rocked it the best I could.","I would buy this dress and hem it to actually fit me, i loved the dress that much!"
"other","Definitely a little longer than tea length as I am only 52.","But, it was not too long at all.","The quality was great and material was perfect weight for a winter event.","It felt like a million dollars on."
"other","The dress is stretchy and very form fitting, so comfortable to move and sit in and very easy to wear.","You can use a regular bra but you might want to opt for shape wear because the dress shows every bump and curve unless you are really thin.","The one design flaw with this dress is that the zipper is located on the side of the dress.","Since the fabric is very stretchy and soft and the zipper is stiff and inflexible, the zipper buckled along the side of the dress when I moved instead of lying smoothly along the side of the body.","I used a wide belt which hid this noticeable fit issue.","I gave the rating 4 stars because of zipper issue.","I would otherwise highly recommend the dress because it is very sexy,so flattering and extremely comfortable.","I received compliment all day about a gorgeous dress!!!","Someone told me I should buy it!","!"
"other","I would have given this a 5 star review but the flare on the skirt is really wide, which I think made me look wider than I am.","Plus because Im short, that also made the dress look to big on me.","Its also surprisingly noisy!","The material is cotton, but because the skirt is so poofy, I felt it made a lot of noise when I walked.","Not a big deal, but kind of annoying.","Other than that, I received many compliments (wore it to a sorority formal luncheon) and it was a nice vibrant color that made me stand out."
"other","This dress was comfortable to wear.","The deep v will show some cleavage for the busty ladies, so either go without a bra or better yet use a bra thats suited for deep vs.","My solution was to use my skin tone camisole and hid the straps behind the halter."
"other","I rented this dress for my birthday this year.","I did NOT want to give it back!!","I loved the detailing of the dress, it fit like a dream.","The only issue i had was the zipper stuck a bit, but i was able to work that out."
"other","I loved this dress!","I wore it for my Engagement photos and completely loved it.","Its beautiful, unique and classy.","It really looked beautiful in pictures.","I usually order both a 2 and a 4, but the 4 was out so I only got the 2.","The 2 fit fine but it definitely felt very snug because the bottom layer is very tight.","If you are a bit bigger in the chest, I would recommend going a size up for your backup, as theres a lot of room on bottom but the tight is top.","I would definitely recommend this dress- my favorite rental by far."
"other","I rented this for Easter, fully intending to wear the 8, however that was too big up top.","So, I went with the 6 because it didnt gap in the back, but it was tight in the waist.","What can I say?","I have a large waist after having a baby.","This is my life now...","The dress is cute, but not super forgiving in the waist.","It also did this thing where it would bunch up in the middle when I sat down.","While I was standing, it was a dream though.","Thats why I gave it 3 stars."
"other","I was surprised at how perfectly this dress fit.","Usually, if dresses fit my waist, theyre too tight for my bust and then too loose for my hips/bottom, but this dress fit amazingly, like it was altered to my body."
"other","This dress was perfect for my Tiffanys themed bridal shower!","There was just enough sparkle and sexy without being too over the top.","Everyone RAVED about the dress!!!!","It made me feel like a superstar all day.","Ordering was easy and the dress arrived on time!","The dress runs large, I ordered a size 0 and 2 and went with the 0.","The only draw back I had was that since this is a popular dress, it is starting to show some wear.. the lace (especially on the sleeves) is starting to fray and you can see the fabric below it.","Thanks RTR!"
"other","I loved this romper and it could be dressed up or down.","I wore it out to dinner on a Friday night and received a few compliments.","If I order again I would order the size down because it was a little loose in the pockets area (yes it has pockets!)","but I would definitely wear it again!","The length was great too."
"other","I was really nervous to wear this because Ive never worn a body con or Herve Leger dress before.","I felt so sexy and beautiful for my bachelorette party.","The small fit much better than the medium (the sleeves were falling off me and it didnt really suck me in).","I was able to wear a regular bra (with extra cups!)","and nude shape wear for my tummy.","I used a bit of fashion tape to secure the dress to my bra and I had no issues.","I really enjoyed it and would wear another Herve dress."
"other","Petites rejoice!","If standard clothing sizes normally look too long, too big or just plain oversized on your small frame, this dress was made with you in mind.","Thanks to the higher cut neckline, well-positioned arm holes and tailored bodice, this lacy mint number sidesteps the typical fit issues that many a petite lady experiences.","It paired perfectly with the Slate & Willow Luncheon necklace I also rented, for all-day graduation events and family portraits.","Nevertheless, proofs from the portrait session revealed a little peek-a-boo bra strap action in a handful of photos (especially side profile), but was unaware of any wardrobe malfunctions the day I wore it.","Definitely game to rent again, but will likely criss-cross my bra straps to prevent any future issues.","Enjoy!"
"other","Fit well.","Gorgeous in person but the bottom hem was a little stretched out"
"other","Cannot begin to explain how fantastic this dress is.","I loved it so much I ended up purchasing it.","I wore it for graduation portraits and for my college graduation ceremony.","Its perfect for that kind of event."
"other","It was a bit short for my 510 frame.","No need for double sided tap or a bra, which was a plus."
"other","I loved this dress and wish I could keep it.","Other reviewers as well as RTR recommend that you size down for your back-up and glad I did because that is what I ended up wearing.","The material is thick ponte knit and stretchy.","I wore high-waisted shapewear to smooth things out and the dress helped with some of the smoothing as well.","This dress is meant to fit tight and hug your body.","It was very flattering and on the warm side, perfect for my fall night out."
"other","Rented this for my rehearsal dinner (like many RTR-ers) and received a ton of compliments!","I did end up wearing the smaller size; its form-fitting but not at all uncomfortable.","Highly recommend you wear spanx with it, as that was the only thing I tried that I couldnt see through the dress."
"other","The fit was lovely.","I would recommend using fashion tape on the bust line though.","The straps easily concealed my bra straps -- a must for a busty lady!","The dress was truly stunning.","I didnt find the sequins itchy at all.","It was bold enough that I didnt need much jewelry -- an updated classic.","I got so many compliments!","I recommend wearing your hair up with this dress so it doesnt get caught in the sequins.","Also, dont worry if the zipper is a little tough.","I had to wiggle mine a little, but it went up easily after that!"
"other","The shorts are crazy short but that running short cut is super flattering.","The top was a little lose and boxy but it balanced out the shorty shorts.","Loved this thing.","I only have a picture from the chest up so Im not adding.","Great for short legs.","Sexy, comfy, casual, night out romper."
"other","A little big, but not too bad.","Cute dress, but nothing terribly special.","Great for a day shower."
"other","This was the perfect Vegas party outfit -- stylish and sexy, yet comfortable and easy to move in.","Im a size 6 (occasionally a size 8) and the medium fit perfectly.","The length of the MR was also PERFECT for me in my 4-inch heels (Im between 55 and 56 in height).","I felt so fabulous and chic wearing this out for fun night in Vegas.","My husband loved it too."
"other","Fit like a glove.","I just chose to go with a sleeveless dress."
"other","very comfortable.","the slip underneath is a little tight at the bottom.","Loved the print."
"other","What I liked about this dress was that it was true to size and the material and shimmer were amazing.","Due to the flare of the dress it does have a slimming effect, but I still recommend shapewear.","I absolutely loved the dress and received compliments on it.","Its definitely a party dress.","My advice to everyone is that if you live in the south in humid areas like Houston, Atlanta, etc.","I would not wear this dress to an outdoor formal event.","It gets too hot and you may feel uncomfortable."
"other","This dress fits large, however as a busty woman i enjoyed that it fit well through the bust.","I vould have sized down."
"other","no photo sadly.","I had it all planned great linen cement color slacks heels etc.. weather changed so I had to also and didnt snap a picture first.","the weather has not improved enough so I  returned it to RTR.","not layering friendly so requires nice weather.","I will reselect for a weekend away"
"other","I loved this dress - I had actually rented a Slate & Willow dress for another occasion.","It was a great fit and looked incredible in person.","Very happy with this rental!"
"other","I loved this dress.","I received so  many compliments on it.","Keep in mind that the belt is tight so you want to order a size up."
"other","The color of this dress is beautiful!","It was exactly what I was looking for, as I wore it to a Democratic Committee fundraising event.","The fabric is high quality material and it feels sturdy and well-constructed.","The top was a little big on me and gaped open at the back of the neck (thankfully my hair covered it).","The straps have snaps on the inside that allow you to hook them to your bra strap so they stay in place (yes, you can wear a normal bra with this dress!).","That helped with the gaping and kept me from having to constantly readjust, since the straps were a little big on me.","The skirt poufs out from the waistline a little more than you can see in the picture, so just be aware of that.","Being 51, I was a little worried about the length being too long, but it was just right.","Overall, I felt that this dress ran a little big compared to other Kate Spade skirts and dresses Ive worn.","I ordered a 4 (my normal size) and a 6 for backup, but honestly think I could have worn a 2.","I was very pleased with this order and would recommend this style for any cocktail party, semi-formal event, or wedding!"
"other","I rented this dress for Thanksgiving dinner with family and I felt very comfortable (even after the big meal).","The dress is great, works for many different occasions and I think its a very appropriate conservative dress for work or family occasions.","The dress does ride up a little bit when moving around a lot, but nothing crazy or embarrassing.","I actually got to wear this dress twice.","I wore it again the next day when I went out with friends to a bar.","I do NOT recommend going out dancing in this dress.","You will get very hot!","Having said that, always felt I looked great, and even though we were at a casual bar, I didnt feel overdressed or too conservative.","I really enjoyed this dress and rent again."
"other","After reading the reviews, I ordered the 2L as a back up, but for me, the 2R fit great.","It was such an easy process, and a fun, gorgeous dress to wear.","Great experience!"
"other","As some people have mentioned this dress is tighter around the shoulders and sleeves so I had sized up to accommodate that fit.","The dress is beautiful, but the empire cut waist was probably not my favorite look.","At times i felt like i looked a little wider than I normally do.","This is by no way a fault of the dress it is more of dressing for your shape.","It did not hit me in the right places as I had hoped, but it still looked beautiful."
"other","I thought this was cute and tried a small since medium was unavailable.","Was very small as I thought it might me, but the medium might have worked if available.","Cute dress for a more casual outing."
"other","I like the look of fit and flare dresses and this was no exception.","This dress isnt a knock your socks off kind of dress, but it is pretty and professional, and I am glad I chose it for the gala that I wore it to.","I am a little bit busty, and the 6 was a little tight in the bust.","The 8 fit perfectly in the bust, but was loose in the torso and waist area, so I chose to wore the 6 instead.","I think I was the only one who could tell that it was a little bit tight, though, and I think it looked very nice."
"other","I wore this to a work award dinner/party.","It was a great choice to cover winter arms and get a little more coverage for a  late winter event.","I rented both the small and medum.","They both fit, but I wore the small.","The lace fabric on the arms and back was soft, and the solid black material was on the thick side with a good amount of stretch.","I wore it with sheer off-black panty hose, black high heeled leather boots, and some Kenneth Jay turquoise drop earrings.","The earrings (not on yet in the picture) were a nice pop of color, which the dress as I wore it needed."
"other","I rented this dress for my MBA graduation, and it was PERFECT!","It is gorgeous and fits true to size--I was even able to wear it without a bra.","The material has a little give--when you first try it on it may be a little tight, but gradually loosens just a bit--in my case it was perfect.","My boyfriend ended up proposing, and hiring a photographer to capture the proposal and take pictures after.","The dress looks gorgeous and flattering in every shot that Ive seen so far.","I would absolutely recommend this dress for your special even, you wont regret it!"
"other","This is such a unique and fun summer style!","I love the black and white color combination and fabric of this dress.","The back is open and has a unique black crisscross design.","The design of the fabric doesnt allow for a lot of stretch, however it is a comfortable fit.","This dress is fitted at the bust and along the natural waist., so I would recommend sizing up for backup.","This would be a great style for a beach wedding with the perfect matching sandals and funky earrings to complete the look!"
"other","The color is not as bright as in the picture so I was surprised, more of the brown family however loved it and it was perfect for a night out with the girls; the dress is comfortable to wear and fun; I topped it off with a jean jacket with heels and loved it!"
"other","This dress was sent to me as a replacement for the one I selected as the dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner and it worked out great.","The detail on the dress is very nice in person and this dress has pockets!","It is a little more snug in the waist than I would have preferred (because I was also sitting and eating so a little more room wouldve been nice) but the fit is true to size.","Also, bonus points: this skirt has a great twirl factor."
"other","I loved how modest it was while still showing off my curves.","It was a little tight around the arms, but other than that, it was great!"
"other","I actually havent worn it out yet because I didnt end going to something I was planning on wearing it for, but I love it so much & its one of the rare things that fits really well, so Im going to wear it to something coming up.","Then Ill update & post a pic.","Im 54 & my measurements fluctuate by an inch or so, a lot, but Im almost always BETWEEN a 4 & a 6, & curvy at 130-135 lbs; my measurements are, on average, 38-27.5-38, (right now, thats where I am & Im a perfect 6 in most things at 135,) & I have had a lot of trouble with the tops & the top half of dresses even though Im a small 36D/full 36C but I dont appear that big- until I try something on!","This fit great in the chest & is cut well for me so that whether Im bigger or smaller, itll still fit, as will the rest of the dress.","The back of it comes to my achilles tendon slightly above my heel, (my inseam is 31.5) so it looks like it was meant to be that length.","If the price were lower, Id buy this one, but Ive also found that for my figure, Saloni seems to be a good choice.","Also, this dress can be dress down with a jeans jacket & low heels, or just worn as a sundress with flat sandals.","I think it would flatter pretty much anyone, as long as you are comfortable with the thin straps, but it could also be worn over a little fitted baby T-shirt or even a tank top."
"other","Great for a special occasion!","I wore it to the rehearsal dinner for my friends wedding"
"other","The fit was amazing- just didnt realize it is a heavy flannel material, and the event was for outdoor photos on a warm day...otherwise, I will rent again in cooler temps!"
"other","Fit perfectly!","I am busty for a size 2, so if you are flat chested, this may not be the dress for you.... but for me, I felt like it cinched flatteringly in the waist and had a minimizing effect for my larger chest (which was just fine by me!)...","I wore it with nude pumps and minimal jewelry.","I got lots of compliments at the luncheon I wore this to, and am sad to send it back."
"other","I loved this dress so much!!","But for some reason I found that it ran small despite the numerous reviews stating the opposite.","I wish I had ordered a larger size as a backup.","I dont have a large rib cage or a large chest so I was surprised this was the case.","Anyway, I made the 6 work and I received SO many compliments."
"other","This dress fit like a glove!","I ordered the M and S, and wore the small.","The dress was lined which made for a smooth seamless look, especially overtop of spanx :-) I felt like a celebrity and everywhere I went I got compliments, I wore black peeptoe pumps and simple diamond studs and my engagement ring (of course!)","that was enough because the dress has so much going on.","I was sad to send it back!"
"other","Figure flatting, easy to wear, comfortable and fun."
"other","Fun and colorful.","I wore black hosiery and accessorized with silver earrings for a work event."
"other","PERFECTION"
"other","I wore this to a baby shower with summer chic as the suggested attire on the invitation.","It was perfect as a classy option that still showed a lot of leg.","Im on the tall side so it could have been a bit longer in the crotch, but I wasnt noticeably uncomfortable in it."
"other","A little shorter than I expected but great for my bachelorette"
"other","This very pretty flowy dress is perfect for work and play.","Only caveat is the v_neck design is a deep plunging c and I wore a white camisole unless you want to show of major cleavage.","I am in between a 4 or 6 but Im glad I went for the 6 (38) because the material has no give.","My measurements 34D-25-42.","its roomy on these hips but just exact on my waist and I was comfirtable for 13 hours that I wore..","Literally from day to night.","I paired with black stockings and otk boots because it was a chilly day in Washington.","The colors are so pretty and did I mention that it flows!!","!"
"other","Wore this to a funeral - I know it is a sad affair - but the last thing you want is to worry about what you are wearing.","This dress was comfortable, conservative and it fit perfectly.","The material is slightly thick which give it beautiful shape.","I recommend!"
"other","I wore this for a graduation and it was perfect!","It was nice and light for the warm weather and simple.","It was the perfect length for me.","I loved loved loved it.","Totally recommend it"
"other","Beautiful, bright and flirty print!","This dress will definitely stand out.","It runs true to size, but was large in the bust on me.","I would recommend sizing up for backup if youre more curvy, and down if youre smaller in the chest.","The fabric is comfortable and I love the gold zipper detail on the back.","Id recommend styling it with a bracelet and studs."
"other","It was the perfect size, the colors are beautiful, I felt amazing and comfortable pairing it up with jeans."
"other","I love this dress and wish I could keep it!","It fit me perfectly.","All night long I was getting compliments.","I ended up going with the size 2 because the size 4 was too big.","The only issue I had with the 2 was getting into and out of the car.","The dress was a little tight around my legs so I had to hike it up to get into the car.","I paired this dress with the Kendra Scott Gold Sanskrit Cuff from R4R (not pictured)."
"other","This dress runs a little larger than other styles Ive tried by Elizabeth and James.","I wore the size 0 and it fit loose and was very easy to move around in.","At 52 it hit me a little below the knee.","I really loved how flowy the chiffon was when caught in the wind.","I wore this with a straw hat for Easter but itd look great with delicate gold jewelry and strappy sandals for the summer."
"other","Spanx may be needed."

"other","I wore this to my daughters rehearsal dinner.","I got so many compliments ."
"other","I really liked this dress.","It fit very nicely and had a very professional feel.","It is a heavier fabric so better for cooler weather."
"other","I loved everything about this sweater!","I wanted to keep it forever and ever!","Super soft.","I kept hugging myself.","lol It kept me warm and cozy!","It does run large, so size down, but if your goal is an oversized sweater, then you should be fine with your regular size.","Would not rec for 6+ months pregnant women because it is shorter in the front, so the belly would bring it up and make it too short."
"other","This dress really Surprised me with how well it fit.","I was certain that my chest was going to spill out of it, but for the plus sizes, it seems that ML took that into account.","There was ample room in the bust.","If you are a plus size with a small bust I would be weary because while it may fir in the waist the bust may be large.","The V wasnt so deep that I felt uncomfortable.","I am 54-55 wearing 3.5 inch heels.","The shoulder flutters were flattering and fun.","Fit and flare is great for anyone who is curvy in the hips.","The waist is fitted but comfortable.","I would rent this for my next cocktail part for sure."
"other","Wore this for Halloween to channel daisy from great gatsby but it would have been fun for any party.","Very comfortable."
"other","This style was a lot of fun!","I loved the sleeves that made it look like a cape!","The material is very soft and stretchy, so it was incredibly comfortable.","This style was a great length for me (right above the knee) so I would be aware of that for the taller ladies.","The cape-like sleeves did make things a little warm, so I think this would be a better style for a winter or autumn event.","I would definitely recommend this style!"
"other","The color was perfect for a day event in the spring/summer.","Ran slightly big but the extra room felt appropriate for an event during the day.","The dress was a great balance of covering problem areas (stomach/waist) while giving shape.","I would definitely get again!"
"other","An edgy black tie look!","This Vera Wang gowns soft, luxurious leather is perfectly rocker-chic.","It runs true to size, but slightly bigger in the bust and waist.","With that being said Id recommend ordering your typical size along with a size down as your free backup.","For undergarments, Id recommend a strapless or thin strapped standard bra.","Note that the picture shown is a sample size and will not run quite as long.","Pair it with edgy accessories to complete the look."
"other","This dress is fitted on the top and then flows perfectly from your hips."
"other","N/A"
"other","I ordered a 14 and 16 I was comfortable in the 16 but I did have to get a backless bra.","The sequence didnt itch it was a long dress and I could dance all night."
"other","Im inlove with Alexis!","All this designers lace dresses are just so classy and feminine!","With the off shoulder look, not only is the design in season but how it falls is just lovely!","Im bloated when I wore this but the size still gives me room to move and very comfortable!","I paired it with nude strappy heels and a statement necklace from Nocturne!","A must rent!"
"other","I loved this when I first put it on because it is very form fitting.","However, the wires that hold up the bust are EXTREMELY uncomfortable to the point that halfway during dinner I had to stick a tissue in the side of it so it would stop rubbing my skin.","I am curvy and busty and short.","This also fit me weird in the torso (there was a lot of extra fabric) because I am tiny.","Not meant for petite sizes."
"other","The back was really low, my corset showed all night.","I was still sexy though!"
"other","The dress fit like a glove, and was so flattering.","I got so many compliments, and thought it was perfect for the occasion.","A couple people even said it would have been good for my bachelorette weekend in Vegas.","Because of the sequins, there definitely is some shimmer when the light hits the dress just right.","I did plan to wear a strapless bra originally, but you could see the outline through the dress in the front, so I went without, which was totally fine because the top is snug and I didnt really need the extra support.","Overall, I loved this dress!"
"other","My first rental: I just received the dress to wear this Saturday to Homecoming and love it soooo much, i thought id write the review now!","Im tall and weigh around 135 with a very slender frame, but some giant hips.","The gathering towards the middle makes my hips look bigger than usual (not by much though) but that was the only flaw it had, and was made insignificant by the total gorgeousness of the dress.","It wasnt short on me at all, actually longer than I had anticipated.","The size 4 felt like it was made for me, so those under 52 might want to have it temporarily altered shorter.","There was not any damage to the dress at all, It seemed brand new, which was my main concern before receiving it.","I am so impressed with RentTheRunway.com, and the dress is absolutely stunning!","When I was references the reviews prior to my purchase, I really wanted to see a picture of it on someone other than the model to have a better idea of what it would look like in person, so I plan on posting one shortly!"
"other","The dress run a little big on me"
"other","It was really great!","It fit very well and was really comfortable.","At times the fabric was a little itchy but it wasnt that big of a deal.","I paired it with some nude pumps and a gold necklace.","I got a lot of complements on the dress.","Also the pockets were great!"
"other","First time using RTR, and it was a great experience!","The dress fits pretty true to size although I probably couldve worn the dress in a size 4 for a slightly better fit.","Beautiful color and I felt very pretty in the dress.","Was perfect for the pre-Derby charity event that I attended!"
"other","Its really big.","I got the 4 and easily could have worn a 2, despite regularly being between a 6 and 8 with a larger bust"
"other","I rented this dress for my Chicago engagement photos.","I paired it with over-the-knee boots to add a little fashion edge to the otherwise sweet and ladylike style.","My fiance absolutely loved this dress and my outfit; he couldnt stop gushing about it.","I loved it too but would have loved it more in  a smaller size.","This dress definitely RUNS LARGE.","Im typically a size 6 in dresses, sometimes an 8 if the brand runs small.","Considering this dress sizing is European, I played it safe and ordered 44 (= US 6) and 46 (= US 8).","The 44 was loose overall, and it was most noticeable in the neck and waist.","I wish I had gotten a size 42 (= US 4) instead, because I likely would have worn it.","I didnt even try on the 46 because it would have been huge.","Im an hourglass/pear shape with a small waist and the dress was pretty loose in the waist and not as fitted/tailored in the bodice and waist as I would have liked.","In some photos, I look thicker in the middle than I am because of the loose fit (you can see the looseness in my second photo).","Previous renters mentioned the dress was too short, but it wasnt for me: It hit mid-thigh, which was perfect with my tall boots.","Ultimately despite the looser fit, I loved the style of the dress and how comfortable it was (the fabric is thick but breathable).","It was exactly what I wanted for my photos.","I got lots of compliments!","This dress can be really versatile for a variety of occasions based on how you style it, too.","My order arrived on time and packaged beautifully in a high-quality garment bag.","Both dresses were freshly cleaned and pressed.","My only complaint about the condition of the dress is that fabric on the collar of the dress I wore was starting to separate, so from some angles it looked as if fabric was hanging down.","Thankfully it didnt show in my photos.","Overall: This is an amazing dress that I would definitely recommend -- just order a size down!"
"other","The length was perfect and great if you have a bust on the larger size.","The only negative was the arm area.","My arms are not in the best shape, so when I put my arms down at the side it showed a bit too much arm fat, but is not the dresss fault though....Very happy with the brand!"
"other","When I tried this dress on for my rehearsal dinner I wasnt initially blown away.","It is pretty plain but once I dressed it up with a belt and shoes I actually really loved it.","The fit was ok.","I normally wear around a size 4 and this was a size 2 and still somewhat loose up top.","The length was good and the material was super comfortable!","All in all, I would probably rent this dress again just not during the summer, the material was pretty thick."
"other","Definitely not for the large-chested.","Im a 36A, so it worked great for me.","I love the color and cut.","I got a ton of compliments."
"other","Got this dress for our engagement photoshoot.","Im Indian, and the colors looked great on brown skin!","Everything fit well, except it was a little hard to zip up.","We ended up getting it though, and it didnt feel too tight.","The dress was really comfortable, and it looked amazing in the pictures!","Id recommend getting the size up for your 2nd size."
"other","Flattering dress and great color.","More of a berry than hot pink.","I wore the 6, but if the 8 was available may have worn for the length.","6 was a bit short.","Had to be careful sitting because of it.","For this reason I opted for tights."
"other","I wore this for a know your rights presentation I had to give at the LA Law Library, and then dinner after.","I had to look like a lawyer, but I didnt want to wear a suit.","It was perfect - thick & comfortable fabric, professional-looking, beautiful & unique color.","It did the work of showing off curves but in a way that keeps everything in place, as well.","I wore the 40, and it seems like that was about right.","I fluctuate between a 2 and 4, but Im a little more on the 4 side at the moment."
"other","I am a 33 bust, small-boned person, slim.","I normally wear a size 2 or 4.","Bec and Bridge size small = size 4.","It fit in an ideal manner.","Not too tight across the bust and loose but not flowy around the waist.","My friends and others in the restaurant and bar for NYE could NOT stop admiring this top.","At the end of the night my bestie turned to me and said screw your - **not buying new clostes in 2018**, if you do not buy this top you are a FOOL!"
"other","I am a size 4 but the 4 was not available, so I made it work with the size 6 and four safety pins.","The neckline looks amazing in person and even though the dress was a bit loose on me, the silhouette made me stand out."
"other","I rented this for some engagement photos.","This dress was amazing, photographed beautifully, and I received endless compliments on it.","It was so flattering and the back is so gorgeous and sexy while still being a classy dress.","So perfect.","Im 53 but the 0R fit fine with high heels.","Love!"
"other","This dress is a gorgeous fuschia color and seems to be well-made.","The lace detailing is interesting, yet not garish or distracting.","I like that this is simple and feminine, but also unique.","It was very tight on me and I found that  I kept having to pull it down, but overall, it was a great dress.","If you are between sizes, size up.","I wore a 6, but wish I had opted for the 8 for comfort.","You can wear a regular bra, which is always a plus!","The dress is long enough to be appropriate for a variety of functions, but still flirty enough to work for a date or other occasion where you want to be a little sexy."
"other","True to size, photographs beautifully.","Would rent this dress again"
"other","I typically wear a size 6 so I ordered the size 42.","I loved this dress!","Wore it to a baptism and got so many compliments on it.","I had to wear a black camisole underneath because of the opening in the front, but it still looked great.","If you dont have a large bust, you might be able to get away with taping the dress down.","All in all, love this dress!","!"
"other","This dress is stretchy and very form fitting.","Very comfortable and the length was great for how tall I am.","Only minor issue was me having to pull the inside lining down after getting up from sitting down.","Im sure I would have been more comfortable in the medium with that."
"other","Loved this dress for my engagement photo shoot.","It fit perfectly and hugged my figure!","It is a little shorter than I expectant but overall it was a fabulous dress :)"
"other","I loved the stitching on this dress.","The dress has the perfect bohemian vibe without taking it to far.","It is not a form fitting dress, but it still gave me a little bit of a shape while still leaving me plenty of room at the hips.","I wore it with heels, but I cannot wait to rent it again to wear to a daytime event with cute casual flat sandals for a completely different look."
"other","I chose this dress for our 10 year anniversary/family photos.","I was nervous because I had gained some weight the last couple years and wasnt overly comfortable in anything, let alone in many photos.","This dress worked awesome!","It cut at the smallest part of my waist and fell perfectly around me.","I would definitely rent again."
"other","The dress was beautiful, just as shown on the RTR website.","Fabric and fit, very comfortable.","Once on the dress fit like a glove, however I just didnt like the way if looked on me.","There is no forgiveness in coverage for any problem areas, which on me, is my stomach.","I f you are a true hourglass figure, this dress would look amazing on you!"
"other","Runs true to size for the most part, but slightly short when sitting.","Great daytime event dress though!"
"other","I wore it to a dinner with Vice President Joe Biden.","I felt chic, elegant and yet comfortable.","It feels like a tuxedo.","I had my 3.5 year old as well, so comfort was important.","The 12R (I ordered 14R too) was somewhat large.","The straps made it hang too long and the crouch was hanging long as well.","I pulled it up and tacked it down which made it fit perfectly.","Im top heavy so I wore a strapless bra which was perfect.","It was fully lined, great quality.","The fabric was somewhat heavy but perfect for early May in Michigan."
"other","True to size.","Fabric is thicker and lined.","You can wear a normal bra and underwear without worry.","However, I didnt find a bra necessary - due to snug fit and thick fabric it holds everything in place.","Definitely rent based on chest size.","The bottom half (stomach and hips area) flares out quite a bit, so its forgiving."
"other","I rented this skirt for New Years Eve and ended up wearing it with a black body suit.","Got lots of compliments on it!!","Definitely agree with others though that its tight in the waist; sizing up was perfect.","My only compliant was the pleats werent as sharp as the photos and ironing didnt create the look I wanted.","Also, it wrinkles very easily so be wary if you plan on traveling with it!"
"other","Its just an easy dress to wear.","Super comfortable, and moves when you walk which makes you feel pretty.","I had so many complements on this, and it was perfect for Mothers Day!"
"other","The fit was pretty good!","The lining in the back showed but that might be because I have a hour glass figure and some derriere.","I wore no bra as I like clean lines.","I did wear a thin thong as dress is very fitted and anything more showed and was a distraction.","I am 50, 111 pounds, and 34DD bust.","I wore it to my favorite restaurant for New Years Eve.","It is a great dress for formal, evening wedding, or cocktail event.","If you do not like attention then do not wear this dress!","It is a Show Stopper!"
"other","The dress itself is beautiful and well constructed.","However, I was not happy with the fit because it was not fit and flare as described, at least not if you have hips!","The skirt is not A line as it looks on the model- it is a sheath/straight fit through the hips.","Had I known this, I would not have rented it because it also has a defined waistline (I am short-waisted so I typically avoid dresses with defined waistlines unless they come in petite as they otherwise dont align properly).","I thought that if the skirt flared, it wouldnt matter if the waist fell correctly, but because the hips were actually fitted, the whole thing didnt sit right."
"other","The fit was perfect and didnt require a bra.","The color is closer to a neon green than true yellow.","She wore a size up simply because its a short romper and was attending a funeral so she was trying to ensure appropriate coverage.","I highly recommend this item.","My sister wore this so her stats are: 59, 9/18/89, 34C, Athletic, 135lbs."
"other","This was a beautiful dress and I would rent it again for another party.","I am a curvy size 6 and the small fit me perfectly.","The only reason I did not wear it was because my first choice of dresses was the one."
"other"," I love the color of this dress!","I am wearing a size medium in the dress and it does fit true to size.","I do recommend curvier women to size up for their backup size.","The dress was fitted around my midsection and waist but not my hips.","The fabric does have some stretch to it.","The dress is great for any cup size.","I am a 36D and felt very comfortable in the dress.","This dress can be worn with a standard bra.","I am 5’9” and the dress was a mini dress on me.","This dress would be great for any casual summer party.","Pair with nude strappy heels and big earrings."
"other","The lace detail on this top is so beautiful!","The bodice fit perfectly.","The arms were a little tight and restricted movement so I would not recommend if you will be dancing but good enough for eating and drinking."
"other","The fit was very similar to the picture and the colors were great.","It wasnt too short which I liked.","I got a lot of compliments!!","I would absolutely recommend this dress!"
"other","I wore this for maternity pics.","Pre pregnancy I wore a size 2/4, I wore this 32 weeks pregnant at a size 10.","It was perfect!","Loved the pics and the dress was easy to wear, even at my size."
"other","Sweet dress.","Beautiful fabric and a nice cut.","It was sent as a replacement after my rental was destroyed.","Thank you RTR"
"other","The dress for the most part fit perfect.","the sleeves were falling a tiny bit here and there but it over all it looked great!"
"other","Stretchy fabric which was nice.","I am 59 and it was a little short in the back."
"other","This outfit was so fun and I received compliment after compliment!","Because my butt is huge, I had to wear the 6, even tho it was big around the waist, but I just put a big vintage belt on and it instantly became my favorite outfit for our Vegas girls trip!"
"other","I absolutely loved this gown.","It was so pretty and I felt amazing in it.","It was a little big as I normally wear a size 0.","With that being said, I could still wear the size 2, so I would have definitely recommend having one size up for your backup.","It was pretty long on me but not to the point where I would not be able to wear it.","You would just need to wear the right heels.","I recommend this dress 100% and I cant wait to wear it again!"
"other","This dress ran a little large but was over all super comfortable and looked adorable on."
"other","I am sorry I did not take a photograph!","That is the best part of the review---to see what a dress looks like on regular human beings in real world situations.","This was a very beautiful dress and my free birthday dress for being Pro.","I actually wore it twice during the time that I had it---to a charity dinner and out on a Saturday night with my friends for my birthday.","The first (charity dinner) was a rush.","It arrived and I flew home after work to throw it on and get to the dinner.","It was a bit sloppy.","I wore it without a belt or much jewelry, with leggings (that were the wrong material) and boots.","I realized all my mistakes and when I had more time to get myself together for outing #2, I work proper hosiery, heels, and belted the dress which gave me more a of a waist.","The pros---the dress is well made, heavy and lined, which made it very comfortable and it was nice to not have to adjust things.","It was also very figure flattering, especially with a belt.","I loved the sleeves.","The cons: It is covered in sequins, which is beautiful, but sitting on them and moving around led to many sequins falling off.","I am still finding them everywhere.","It is also somewhat difficult to wear anything but very simple jewelry since the dress competes.","Others notes: The neckline is low.","I had to wear a tank top underneath which made it look less dressy.","I wrote that it runs big because I normally wear a 14 and the 12 fit perfectly.","Truthfully it was a bit of work to get over my boobs since theres no zipper, but once in place if fit very well."
"other","Great fit!","A little tight in the bust but I have big boobs so Im use to that.","The skirt was a great length and the white dress was the perfect outfit for our tennis teams hat theme, Breakfast at Wimbledon."
"other","I rented this dress for my bridal shower.","I didnt want something too typical for my in-coffee-house shower, and this dress was just the right amount of fun and classy with the print and quirky hem-line.","I am normally a 4-6 and I wore the medium, it had much more purple on it which I wanted (my color is lavender) and the small was much more pink.","I could have worn the small if I wanted a tighter fit but I wanted to be comfortable and twirly.","Compliments all around!"
"other","Beautiful, but very low cut.","I couldnt wear it"
"other","I normally wear a 4, but the sleeves were so tight and even though I have a small chest, the back couldnt even zip up so I went with the 6.","I wore it for a dinner event in NYC with a bunch of other attorneys and I def stood out in a sea of black:) I received so many compliments...probably one of the top complimented dresses I rented from RTR ever!","It was comfortable, not overtly sexy, and had a super-feminine vibe.","Loved it."
"other","Even in a large size, the bust is just not fitted properly for a woman above an A-cup (Im a C, and it would have taken darts running from the bust upwards to the armholes in the direction of the shoulders for the chest have enough curvature for a good fit).","It fit perfectly through the waist and hips though.","The dress was absolutely gorgeous, just not the right shape for my body.","I wish I couldve worn it!"
"other","The dress did run a little lose on me .","I wish it was tighter and more fitting.","On the other hand the dress is so beautiful and it definitely compliments the body.","I honestly didnt look like myself  for prom but in a good way.","The dress is so elegant and glamours that i felt as if i were going to the Oscars.","i wish i owned the dress !"

"other","This dress, although I wore a size larger than my regular dress size (an 8 instead of a 6), was perfect for my rehearsal dinner and also for a small busted woman such as me.","Im a 34AA and it made me look more buxom than normal.","I agree with the other reviewers that if you have a larger bust itll probably be too tight.","I received so many compliments and I felt feminine and beautiful.","Would totally wear this dress again!","!"
"other","This came as an extra dress because of a mix-up.","I love how RTR chose a style that was similar to the one I had ordered even though it was not the exact dress.","It was really pretty.","Fit like a glove.","A little more plain than my usual rentals but the lemon color was very nice.","I probably would have ordered a 2 next time for a little more breathing room."
"other","Perfect fit"
"other","This jumpsuit is true to size and the fit was perfect.","The only thing that couldve made it better was the length.","Im 510 and my legs of course are long, I couldve used about another inch or two for the length.","Other than that it was stunning!"
"other","I have rented this dress in every color - it is my go-to favorite dress.","Perfect fit!","The arms are a little snug so I would not suggest it if you have bigger or more muscular arms.","Otherwise, it fits very true to size.","I particularly love the pockets!"
"other","This dress was perfect for my engagement photos.","It is sophisticated and romantic as well as comfortable.","The heavier fabric layers kept me warm on a chilly day.","Its the perfect silhouette for anyone whos smaller on top and larger on the bottom.","I thought the fit was true to size, but can see what other reviewers say about it being a bit snug in the arms, although it was not enough to make the dress uncomfortable.","The only issue I had was pairing it with a shoe, as I didnt like how tan or nude heels looked against the dresss white lace overlay.","I ended up choosing a pearlescent, shimmery heel, but I think silver or white shoes would work well too."
"other","Dress was comfortable, had just enough stretch hold everything in place but I never felt like a sausage."
"other","I love the dress, the back was the best feature.","the front made my belly stick out a bit but overall it was fine.","very short but not trashy short.","didnt like that when i danced i felt llike the dress kepted moving out of place.","the shoulders would come down, i always had to adjust myself.","its definitely not a party dance all night long type of dress.","its a sit down look pretty have dinner take pictures kinda a dress for sure!",";-) but i loved it.","Got many compliments all night.",";-) thank you RTR for all your help."
"other","I did not have to wear a bra even having a large chest everything stayed in place and shape of the dress worked great for my figure"
"other","I dont usually wear colorblock dresses but I have to say I was a huge fan of this style!","Im 56 and the dress hit me at tea length.","It runs true to size but with no stretch to the fabric I recommend going up a size for back up.","Im a 34B and I had comfortable room in the bust so its great for any cup size.","You can wear a NuBra or no bra at all.","Pair it with some strappy heels or wedges and you are all set with any daytime event!"
"other","Loved this dress.","The denim was a very unique color but not too much that it looks out of the ordinary.","The fabric also had great movement to it as opposed to some other denims that can be a little stiff.","Also it sounds crazy to mention something as small as the buttons on the dress but it really made it very unique being that they werent plastic, they seemed to be copper.","The dress fit true to size and very much like a shift.","Could pair it with any shoe!"
"other","I rented this for a coffee fundraiser, but it didnt arrive in time.","The cut and fabric are very pretty.","I wish I could have worn it."
"other","I am very petite so I was happy this dress wasnt too big or baggy.","It looked tailored and fit like I could have owned it.","It is very flattering dress with the waste line.","I wore a strapless bra with the dress to fill out the top.","The fabric of this dress FAR exceeded my expectations.","It is a thick and very high quality fabric, and the color is rich with bit more burgundy in it that the model photo.","My photo is not an accurate color of the fabric, its more red than it seems here.","Great dress, and would rent again!"
"other","I felt like a princess!","The fabric is very luxurious and thick - but not too warm for a hot day (80 degrees).","I got so many compliments on this dress.","Wore it with the suggested Lulu Frost earrings and silver strappy shoes.","The dress fit perfectly in a size 10 (my normal size).","This really is a unique and special dress."
"other","I wore this dress to a polo match.","The fit was exceptional, it had a little stretch in all of the right places."
"other","The sparkle and bright white made this stand out.","Was very comfortable and definitely runs large as I normally wear a 4 or 6."
"other","I usually wear size2, but they are all booked out at the time I put the order, so I went with 4R.","I would say its a little big, but the length is perfect with a 3.5 inch heel."
"other","I rented this dress for a Theatre Awards Ceremony.","I got compliments all night about what a great dress and how wonderful I looked.","To be totally honest though, I wasnt sure I loved it when I first tried it on.","If it were in a store, I probably would have kept shopping.","The material felt just a little heavier than it appeared online.","It still had great swing and it was nice that it felt substantial, just not what I expected.","I took a cue from other photos and reviews on here and added a satin ribbon belt- that helped a LOT for me, just gave a little more definition.","I think I liked the dress more and more as the night wore on though to be honest!","As many other reviewers suggested I got a smaller size as back up, and that is what I wore.","Im almost exclusively a 6 in dresses, but this one felt a little boxy and loose- certainly not unwearable, just not quite right.","The 4 was better overall, though the waist was a tad high on me; I chose to go with it anyway.","(Note- Im not quite sure hourglass is the right description of my body, Im somewhere between that and pear.","My weight is pretty evenly distributed so I do have a noticeable waist though not a tiny one!)","I was a little concerned about the itchiness of the sequins others had mentioned, but although I did notice them, I wasnt red or raw or uncomfortable at all.","Mind you, I dont have very sensitive skin either.","Aside from the dress, the RTR experience was pretty great!","I didnt realize shipping was more expensive on a Saturday, and since the event was on a Monday night I had no other choice than to pay as much for S+H as I did for the dress itself.","There were a few loose threads on the dress, but when sequins are involved and its been worn more than once Id say thats to be expected.","Will definitely consider renting again!"
"other","It felt short when I was walking, but probably because Im not used to wearing this length.","My sisters assured me that it didnt ride up while I was walking!","Comfortable fit  and no bra needed!"
"other","TTS with room to give as needed."
"other","This dress fit like a glove and truly is a showstopper.","I traditionally wear size 0-2 (depending on the brand).","I wore the 0 and it fit perfectly.","(Im 53, 110lbs, 32A).","I loved the detail on the embroidery and how elegant it made me feel.","Considering how your clothing is normally covered up by bulky gowns at a graduation, it was truly shocking how many people commented on this dress while my graduation gown was unzipped.","10/10 would rent again, and would recommend!"
"other","Wore this for a photo-shoot with my husband.","Rib cage area was tight, so dont wear this dress after youve eaten.","For members of the IBTC, you should invest in petals/stinky bra to help fill out the top.","Be aware that you should have excellent posture (shoulders back) so that the straps dont fall and expose the girls.","The color was a beautiful turquoise, and the dress flowed wonderfully for our pictures."
"other","This dress is ideal.","It is cute and classy yet the colors and style of it make it unique and sexy at the same time.","The material is amazing and although it is thick it has stretch and beautifully clean lines.","Got this through my Unlimited subscription and I have actually worn it to work (law office) and also to an all girl brunch in Manhattan!","Love it!!","!"

"other","This was my first rental.","VERY happy!","Runs true to size.","I read it was tight in the arms, so even thought I wear normally a 2 or 4, I reserved the 4&6.","The 4 fit like a glove.","Many compliments!"
"other","I rented this as my backup dress and ended up wearing it the second night we were in Vegas (girls weekend).","Its the perfect dress for Vegas - short and shiny!","Like other reviewers I do agree that it runs large as I fit into the small and typically wear a medium or equivalent.","The sequins under the arms are a tad annoying, but nothing major.","Overall it was a fun dress to wear, but not my absolute favorite...even with the small I still felt like it was a bit too big and wasnt as flattering as it could have been."
"other","This dress fits more like a junior size 4.","Typically I wear a womens size 2 or 4 and this dress fit me like a glove...almost too tight.","If I order this outfit again, I might try the 6R as it was a little bit difficult to zip up.","I had to have help zipping it every time I had to use the restroom.","I didnt wear a bra with this top, the material is thick enough.","I have longer legs and a shorter torso.","The pant legs were long enough."
"other","I went with a medium, despite being large busted (34DD) and 58.","The dress is very short, so be careful if you bend over!","It was perfect level of formality for my evening graduation event and very easy to move around in.","I got tons of compliments.","I had to wear a strapless bra, as the straps showed in the front when I tried to wear a racerback."
"other","I had 4 dresses to choose from, 3 were Herve Leger from RTR and one was a dress I purchased myself.","My mom insisted that I wear this for my masters graduation and a few friends agreed as well, so I trusted their opinion and went with it.","Im so glad I did!","It photographed amazing in pictures and I received compliments from the moment I got out of the car.","Its a very tight fit, you might need another person to help you zip it up.","I was worried about the fit at the shoulders since it was a little loose, but if you wear your hair down, it shouldnt be a problem.","Wear thongs that are not very tight on you as they will dig into the skin and the dress will emphasize the gap.","I rented it for an extra week for my vacation but unfortunately didnt get a chance to wear it there again.","This dress is absolutely stunning.","I love the length, it brushed below my knees and didnt slide up at all.","I wish I could have kept it.","I took so many pictures of the dress alone, I was obsessed!"

"other","The gown fit like a glove.","The color was stunning.","The gown was simple with just a little sass.","I highly recommend it."
"other","What a fun spin on a little black dress!","The size 4 was a perfect fit for me - form-fitting, flattering, comfortable.","I could have easily worn the size 6 if I wanted it to be slightly less form-fitting and it would have still looked very nice.","The dresses were clean and in great shape; the clutch was nicely packaged.","I had a snag with my delivery being delayed due to unforeseen weather conditions and RTR saved my day...and unlimitedly my event!","Awesome, awesome customer service!","This was my first RTR experience and will not be my last - I already have a dress reserved for an event in a few weeks.","Kudos and thanks to RTR!"
"other","Did not love it.","Busty short girls beware.","This dress will not compliment your body type.","Length hit mid/lower shin on me - matronly for this gal.","Would have been cuter if I could have hemmed it to be just below knee like the model.","Also lots and lots and lots of ruffles (very full double ruffle) all around only magnified how top heavy I am.","Would look great on a tall thin person.","Empire waist and VERY full skirt.","Lots and lots of flowy fabric on the bottom.","Would be a great maternity dress as it would accommodate any size baby bump.","Pros - bright pretty colors.","Im sure this would be a gorgeous dress on a different body but made me look older and frumpier than necessary."

"other","Disclaimer - I usually do not wear tightly fitting clothing, as I like to not be restricted in movement.","With that said, I rented this dress for a part of my engagement photo shoot - it was a replacement dress.","The dress fit great and was good for picture purposes, so I was satisfied.","The fabric is very heavy and sits nice, but it does not sit as flat as I would like, creating some wrinkles (I steamed it before wearing too and that didnt do that trick).","Its figure-flattering, but not sure how I would have liked it/moved init had I rented this for any other purpose but for a photo shoot!"
"other","This dress is great!","The color is wonderful - very rich in person.","I felt the sleeves were comfortable, the length was appropriate, and the tailoring flattering.","The dress does have pockets which are convenient, but there is a small flare around the hip area because of that...","I chose this dress for a (cocktail) charity event and it was perfect for the evening.","The material is a little heavy so Id avoid it if you plan to be outside at say a summer wedding or something, but otherwise, do yourself a favor and rent this dress!"
"other","I got a ton of compliments on this dress at my cousins bridal shower.","This dress definitely fits true to size.","Not too short.","ESP if you have darker hair like myself, this dress really pops!","Would rent again."

"other","I wanted a very special eye-catching dress to celebrate my 60th birthday.","This dress was absolutely perfect For the occasion.","Im usually a size 6 to 8 but right now a bit on the chubby side of 8 and the 8 was a good fit.","I only had one minor issue with the dress.","I thought the little peplum skirt was too short and  flared out too much.","I wore a wide black belt which flattened it down a bit.","My husband also agreed that the dress looked better with the black belt because it broke up the very bold design.","I felt like a million dollars in this dress.","My third time with RTR and Im hooked!","I may never buy another dress."
"other","The ruching on the stomach is super flattering!","The neckline is great and is flattering for any bust size.","This would be a perfect dress for a spring or summer wedding!","The material is thick, so there isnt really a need for shapewear.","I was very comfortable in this style and would definitely rent it!"
"other","Overall the dress fit well, but the top portion was too big - I had to use fashion tape to tape the shoulders to my back so they wouldnt fall off.","I think the 4 would have helped with this problem, but that size was unavailable."

"other","It was a beautiful dress but a bit unconfortable but i would rent it again"

"other","Felt like a celebrity in this dress!","Running true to size, we recommend sizing up for backup.","It is fitted throughout the midsection and hips, but the fabric does have stretch.","Im between a 4/6 and I felt the UK 10R (US size 6R) was so flattering and fit me like a glove!","It is great for any bust size as there is room at the bust, but you may want to have fashion tape handy!","Without heels, it was 4 inches from the floor on me.","Pair this look with an updo and bold statement earrings at your next gala, youll be sure to stand out!"
"other","So comfortable!","I usually wear a size 4 and the size Small fit perfectly.","This dress is so easy to dress up or down.","This would be perfect for any bust size since you can wear it with a standard bra.","The dress is fitted but has plenty of stretch, I would pair it with nude heels and a statement necklace to dress up!"
"other","The perfect day to night summer dress!","With a blazer or cardigan, you could wear this dress to the office, and then out with friends after work.","The small cut outs give the dress a subtle sexiness while still being conservative.","The overall fit is fitted and there is no stretch in the fabric.","I recommend going up one for back up.","This style will also work best for A-C cups, and a standard bra can be worn.","At 57, this dress it right below my knee (knee/tea length)."
"other","I wore the 8 for the bust.","Fit great, looked great!"
"other","I wore this for my engagement photos and I didnt want to take it off!","This is the perfect LWD for any bridal occasion.","The back is stretchy at the top so its very forgiving and the halter part ties so again, its pretty adjustable.","I wore the XS because of the stretchy back, it felt more snug and comfortable than the S. The length was nice as well, I really loved the handkerchief hem and that it wasnt all one length.","If youre looking for something delicate and pretty for a summer day then this is the dress for you!"

"other","I do not have weird shoulders (I hope) but this jacket did!","Perhaps I ordered I size too small but even in the four the shoulders seemed to jut out from my body funny.","The back was also cut much higher than the front and looks terrific but it almost made this blazer too formal and not casual enough for my laid back office.","Maybe if I had the right dress and heels it would be amazing but not with my flats and work tops."

"other","LOVED the fit of this dress.","It hugged my body and showed off all curves.","I wouldnt recommend a bra if you can get away with it because the tiny cutout under the bust is such a cute accent you wouldnt want to ruin it with a bra.I would wear a thong to not have any lines in the dress.","It hit me right above the knee.","The polka dots are gold if you couldnt tell.","Fit true to size, I would size up for backup."
"other","This was my first time using Rent the Runway so I was a little nervous.","Was glad I ordered a backup size.","Ended up wearing the bigger one because the sleeves were tight on the 6.","Received so many compliments.","Would definitely recommend it!"

"other","i rented this dress for a bridal shower.","i needed a dress that wasnt too short on my tall frame and it definitely fit the bill for being long enough.","but, like others have said, it was really loose in the bust.","it took my most padded bra and four safety pins to make sure i didnt reveal myself during the party, but it worked!","other than the bust, it definitely fit true to size; im typically between a 4 and 6, and i fit in both that were sent to me.","i ended up going with the 6 for a little extra length.","it was definitely comfortable and the color was very nice."

"other","I wore this to my bridal shower and everyone loved it!","I will admit that the fabric was not quite what it appears in the photo.","I was expecting something softer, but this material was a little stiffer (even though it did have a little stretch), and it almost felt a little like corduroy.","Everyone loved the peplum shape, which I was a little nervous about, but decided once it was on, it made my waist look a little narrower (I like to think!).","Everyone raved about it and no one could believe it was a rental.","Very cute dress!"
"other","I wore this dress for my bachelorette party dinner.","I LOVED it!!","I felt so beautiful and like I was walking the red carpet the whole time I was in it.","Based on reviews, I was expecting the gown to scratch under my arms, but I had no problem with that.","I did wear about 3 heels and thought the dress was a little too short when I had them on.","The only other thing I would recommend is having fashion tape because the top slides down a bit.","Overall, I loved this dress and felt really gorgeous in it.","I didnt want to return it.","(Side note-  my beautiful sister on the left has a RTR dress on, too, which she loved!","Shes 6 months pregnant!)"

"party","The dress was beautiful but if I had bought it rather than rented it I would have taken it in.","I would normally wear a size 10 but the bust was a BIT snug so had to go with the 12.","Although it was a little loose fitting for this reason, it also made it comfortable and I received many compliments on it!","Overall size was true to fit and I would recommend it."
"party","I wore this dress for a great gatsby themed wedding party.","It worked well as I wasnt sure about how into the theme others would be getting and the dress wasnt overly costume-y, but still fit the bill perfectly (with an added accessory or two).","The dress is definitely attention-getter--would probably also work well for New Years!"

"party","Pros:  I loved pretty much everything about this dress.","The true waist and the gathers at the side made it very flattering.","I was afraid the pink hues might be wrong for a Christmas party, but it worked really well.","The embroidery is quite formal, but I found that the work, against a black background, was quite sharp and modern, not old-fashioned.","The see-through fabric and sweetheart-type neckline were so pretty, and I found the dress to be quite comfortable.","Cons:  The only con was that the bra situation was a little tough.","Im not built to go braless, so I wore strapless.","It was mostly fine -- just had to adjust a few times during the night when it became visible.","Size:  You should order at the lower end of normal for you, or even a size smaller.","I am smaller on top -- usually a small top and a 10/12 pants, and I wore a size 4 in this dress.","The skirt was not tight for my traditional pear-shape...!","!"
"party","I love the idea of this dress, it came as a replacement when the Nha Khanh Sabrina Tulle dress wasnt available.","Though they are similar in design and cut, the white lace overlay on this dress made a poor choice for a NYE cocktail party.","I opted to go with another RTR option instead."
"party","Nice heavy fabric for cool weather.","The wrap at the chest is a little tricky and required me to wear a camisole.","The length is great.","The color is a bit more orange-red in person."
"party","I absolutely love the colors and pattern on this dress.","The material (like scuba gear) fits like a glove but was constantly riding up during the party.","I had to keep adjusting / pulling it down.","I have long legs, but it felt too short for my comfort level."
"party","The fit was perfect and the colors were bright.","I loved the length.","I was able to wear a nude bra with no problem.","The fabric was light and detailed.","It was perfect for the Derby."
"party","From past experiences, I always get the next size up thinking this will be dress Ill have to choose.","Not so with this beauty.","It fits true to size.","The lace edging is dainty and feminine.","The dress fits like a glove but has a little stretch in it.","I was comfortable even into the wee hours of the night.","Many compliments all night."

"party","I usually wear an 8, but even the 10 was very right for me & I chose not to wear this dress at all.","Its beautiful but something about it wasnt right for me.","Disappointing since it looks amazing in the pics.","Next time!"
"party","I am 54 and the regular was just a *little* too long to wear with flats but I just held it up a little when I walked and wore flats anyway.","The fabric of the skirt is substantial and the crochet knitting at the top is very comfortable.","Would be great for a casual wedding!","I wore this to an outdoor concert/summer party event with my boyfriend and I felt so classy and put together.","Would rent this piece again for sure!","Anyone less than 54 may find it prohibitively long to wear with flats so I would suggest wedges!","Be prepared to tell others about RTR all day/night - everyone wanted to know where I got this maxi!"

"party","Fantastic dress for an outdoor party.","Wore this piece on a dinner cruise in Los Angeles.","While many of the guests needed jackets I was warm, cozy, and fashionable.","Thank you RTR!"
"party","It ran a tad small due to the body hugging nature of the dress, but it was pretty comfy.","I like having the sequins in a long sleeve so that they do not rub against my arms.","You cannot wear a regular bra with this, but I had no problems going without.","I loved the color, sparkle, and the how it hid a bit of my mid section issues due to the pattern."
"party","This dress is beautiful and easy to wear.","Didnt want to return it!","I am 57 and I am glad I went with the longer length!"
"party","The length was perfect, it all fit very true to size."
"party","I really enjoyed this dress!","But just for one night (glad I rented and dont own it).","I should have ordered a size 4 (my typical size) and 2, whereas I order sizes 4 & 6.","I am curious as to how the size 2 would fit (possibly much better).","It was fun to wear, but if I could go back, I wouldnt take photos from a side angle/profile.","In person, I think it was flattering, but depending on where the photo cuts off, sometimes I looked pregnant.","The waist is high and it flares out, giving such an impression.","Other than that, it was very well-made.","I loved the fabric.","Other reviews complained the lace was worn-out, but I argue otherwise.","I think it was quite nice, without many any noticeable signs of wear & tear.","I would recommend renting it (not buying it)."
"party","Materials is a little heavy, but it worked great for me - it fit well without clinging in the wrong people.","Got lots of complements."
"party","This dress was perfect for the multifaceted event I attended.","Formal enough for the formal dining event, comfortable enough for a visit ti the theater, and fun enough for a walk through several streets for an outdoor street party.","Very flattering.","I suggest a one piece shapewear as the dresss fabric does show lines of undergarments.","All in all, so happy I ordered this dress!","NOTE: I was lucky that the 10L fit well, as the 12L had loose beads on the strap and looked very unseemly."
"party","I wore this dress to my sisters bridal shower and it was perfect!","It fits more like a sleeveless dress than is pictured on the model.","The snap closure on the chest cinches the opening together, but I could have really secured things with a safety pin.","Im 59 and the dress came to my ankles...I wore neutral colored, flat sandals.","It was comfortable and really flattering...the perfect dress to wear as MOH without upstaging the bride at her own shower!","I will absolutely rent this one again!"
"party","This dress runs true to size.","I normally wear a size 4 and the 4 fit perfectly."
"party","I wear a size 6, I am 510 and a 147 pds broad shouldered with extra long arms.","My inseam is 33.","The dress fit perfectly in the shoulder and the chest.","and the arm length was perfect as well.","The bow tied high looked really  sophisticated.","I rented for a museum opening because the dress code was business attire.","I got so many compliments and the dress and the pairing with a red shoe."
"party","Rented this dress for a Vegas nite out.","The dress doesnt really have much give.","The 6 I received was stretched out around the stomach/hip area -- watch out for this when the dress arrives.","The color is amazing:  I was afraid it was going to be too shiny but the color/design is flattering.","Dress was easy to dance in/sit in.","Give this dress a shot!"
"party","Wore this dress during a bachelorette weekend.","The fit was great and it lightweight which was great for a party in New Orleans.","One downside of the dress, is the sheer panels are to sheer.","They have a flesh/nude tone lining that did not match my skin color.","If you have darker or olive ton skin, be aware that the bottom panels will not be sheer."
"party","Amazing dress!","Ive rented this one in both the black and gold.","Very flattering.","Love that I could wear a real bra but didnt feel like the girls were on display.","Gathers at the waist and hides mid-section very well.","I also have very long legs and could wear heels without feeling that the dress was too short.","Highly recommend!"
"party","Fit snug, and I sized up quite a bit.","Did wear a bra, which was fine for me."
"party","This was definitely a crop top which doesnt show as that in the image provided by RTR.","I loved the fabric and the fact that I didnt need to wear a bra but if you plan to wear this and dont want your midsection showing you will need a high wasted skirt/pants.","The slight hole in the top didnt show on me at all unless a gust of wind lifted the ruffle.","Super comfortable!"
"party","I rented this for a winter event but we have had a really mild winter.","It was very cute and fashion forward but very hot.","It only was very heavy due to all the sequins."
"party","Loved this number, it is flattering, stylish, and easy to wear!"
"party","Warning - this is SUPER short.","Im 58 and ive never worn such a short dress."
"party","The dress was awesome!","It was slightly large in the chest area for an A cup; however, its so low cut that with a larger chest you might bust out of it a little bit.","I wish the dress had been a tad shorter (Im 52) but on someone a little taller it would be just the right length for a night out."
"party","I wish I had a photo of myself in this dress because it was about the prettiest Ive ever felt.","For women with big hips and thighs, it conceals everything.","Absolutely stunning.","I didnt want the evening to end."
"party","Its a little big in the chest compared to the photo.","I couldnt get a smaller size in time for my event, so I decided to put a belt on with it.","People stopped me everywhere to compliment the dress!","Its very comfortable although it little warm.","I sweated more than usual in it.","Also tall ladies beware: Its pretty short in the back!"
"party","Not flattering on my body type (5 5 and apple shaped).","VERY nice quality and details.","Would be a good option if you want arm coverage."
"party","Got this for NYE!","It was perfect.","A little heavy and can get itchy form some of the sequins (but not a deal breaker at all).","the dress was also longer on me than I had hoped, came to just about my knee, when i was hoping it would be a few inches above as it is on the model.","but i guess thats what you get for being 54..","It was great to be able to wear a regular bra but it was simple and easy and a great dress to ring in the new year with :)"
"party","Super flattering!","I am usually a size 6/M.","I have a DD chest and this dress was so flattering on."
"party","I purchased it I loved it so much.","Great compliments."
"party","I absolutely loved this dress!","I wore it to fancy Christmas party held at a country club.","I got tons of compliments.","It fit like a glove.","The only thing that was disappointing regarding the dress I received is that the left seam at the bottom puckered out.","It was not very noticeable, but I could tell.","Also, the sequins caught on everything, but that was a minimal price for looking awesome.","For my height (6) the skirt hit above mid thigh.","I wore opaque, black tights so that made me feel a bit more comfortable with it being so short on me."
"party","It was so comfortable and sparkly.","I wore it to the Grammys and felt like I was dressed like any of the celebrities.","I got tons of compliments.","Had to use the tape to make sure the bust material didnt gap but RTR included some so it wasnt an issue."
"party","I wore this for my friends bachelorette party on Halloween where she dressed as an angel and we were all devils.","The dress was a great fit and perfect for the occasion.","The only thing that stopped this from being a 5 star dress for me was the fit up top.","Im very small-chested and it was a little big and I was self conscious at first about the back straps being a little loose.","The bright side of this was that I didnt need a bra for the dress.","It was short as well (and Im only 52) but that worked fine for my event.","BTW - my friend in the picture is also wearing a RTR dress that worked perfectly for the party as well :)"
"party","Fit like a true size 4.","Length was just a little long - Im 53 and it was about an inch and a half too long.","In the picture it hits above the knee.","It was below my knee"
"party","This dress fit me perfectly in all the right places although it was a bit snug around the rib cage (I have a very narrow rib cage)."
"party","Great fit for an hourglass shape, but wouldn’t recommend this dress for a small bust.","I went down one size and I am a 34DD.","I wore this dress in a size 4.","Also need to wear this dress braless or with a strapless bra so it needs to fit well in that area.","This dress definitely stood out and I received tons of compliments.","Very flattering along the waistline and I have to say it looks better in person than in pictures.","I had originally ordered another style that didn’t look good and this was a last minute backup and actually one of my favorites"
"party","I dont even know where to begin!","The color and fit was perfect.","It ran a little large so I couldve worn a size 8, but now I know for the future.","I was told I should buy it.","Still considering it.","I will rent this again and soon!"
"party","Fit true to size.","I got the 6 and the 8, but the 8 was a little big in the bust area."
"party","I loved the fit and the color of this dress!","I felt pretty and comfortable, and it was easy to dance in!","The fit was true to size, with the exception of the straps which were too long and would have set the dress under my breasts if Id kept them that way.","Instead, I clipped the straps around my neck and it actually made the dress look even better in my opinion.","Id definitely recommend this dress for a party or formal affair!"
"party","This dress was comfy and cute and definitely got me lots of compliments.","It didnt ride up and it wasnt too scratchy.","Perfect for my birthday party!"
"party","I joke to my friends that my criteria for a dress are flaunt the boobs, hide the hips and this dress fit the bill :) It was extremely flattering and very comfortable (with the exception of a little rub under the armpits, which I noticed mentioned in some other reviews too).","It hugged through the waist giving me a really flattering silhouette that was not tight or uncomfortable, and the skirt was wide enough to be comfy and flattering without being too poofy.","It was also a great length for me -- Im just under 54.","There was a tiny gape around the armholes / at the upper back of my shoulders but if it had been any tighter around the arms I think it would have been uncomfortable.","For my bust size at least, it could be cleavage-bearing or more conservative depending on how much of a push-up bra I wore.","I was initially going to wear this for our law school prom with black strappy sandals, but I wound up wearing it for graduation with nude peep-toe wedges instead.","Both shoes looked good.","Ive posted pictures of both (the former also shows the earrings I rented, the Slate & Willow Adam earrings, which I didnt end up wearing for graduation).","The 2 fit great but I tried on the 4 for the heck of it and found that it was a very similar fit through the torso and the only noticeable difference was more space in the upper back / shoulder / armhole area.","I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"party","This dress is beyond wonderful!","I was so nervous about the size because Im normally a petite 4/6 and I had to order the small, but it fit great!","The arms were just a teeny bit tight when I first put it on, but it wasnt uncomfortable at all.","Also, the dress has build in spanx (essentially) so it will look amazing on anyone.","I wish I could order this in every color!","!"
"party","Spanx definitely needed.","I could have worn the small but then the dress wouldve risen higher.","Medium was a perfect length."
"party","Fits large and is quite long.","I am 54 and this tea length dress was at my mid-calves which made the fit pretty unflattering.","It is a beautifully made dress but do not recommend for shorter women."
"party","Very comfortable.","It did have a few runs in the skirt portion"
"party","I wore this dress for my law school graduation and the party afterwards.","I loved the sleeves and the lace.","I was a little concerned that the sleeves would be too tight because I have larger arms but it fit perfect.","I agree with the other reviewers that the blue is more royal that in the picture but that made me like the dress more."
"party","I wore this dress to a spaceship/futuristic themed party.","This dress was a total showstopper.","I had everyone coming to look at it.","As you can see from the pics, I am curvy and the dress looked great and it was comfortable.","Other reviewers complaint about the sequins locking on each other but I really didnt experience that.","TIPS: This dress has no zipper so I strongly recommend you put it on before you get your hair done.","Other than that, Ill say it runs true to size."
"party","This dress is absolutely gorgeous!!!","Much prettier in person than in pictures.","The material is thick but not too heavy.","It was a little small especially in the chest which is why I opted for the 8 instead of the 6.","It was very comfortable.","I also didnt think it was too short either.","I got compliments all day!"
"party","This dress fit well and was comfortable!","It was a little long and the top is thick/heavy but perfect for a cooler evening.","I would wear it again."
"party","Good stretch would have been comfortable to wear for any occasion, ran slightly big IMO."
"party","I rented this dress for New Years Eve in Las Vegas, and it was perfect.","The dress was super comfy, and the fashion tape kept everything in place.","I cant wait until I can Rent the Runway again!"
"party","Its like a sweater dress but with an interesting pattern and flounce at the bottom.","Nice weight to the material also, not too heavy or itchy."
"party","Didnt have the chance to wear this dress.","The dresses came and the 4 fit so I packed it for our girls weekend.","The 2nd night party was cancelled and the 1st night party wasnt the right occasion for this dress so I was never able to wear it out.","Went back to RTR never worn, bummer.","I probably wouldnt rent again b/c I liked it but I wasnt thrilled and didnt have that need to rent again so I can wear it moment.","Definitely runs big as they suggest so I rented my normal size 6 and went down for back up and the 4 fit perfectly."
"party","Beautiful dress.","Great fit.","Perfect for someone with a large bust."
"party","Chest was a little tight but the rest of the dress fit well.","It was very comfortable.","The top is very low cut."
"party","It wouldnt zip all the way up."
"party","Normally wear a 2, but had to wear the back up size 4.","The dress had nice, thick fabric.","Slightly more pink than I had expected."
"party","The dress is beautiful, fun, lightweight, but as others suggested the straps were too long.","I ordered an 8 and a 10 (I usually wear an 8 in a dress) and the straps and bust on the 8 were way too big.","Im a 34D and the straps were 4 inches too long.","There was a possibility to fold them under and pin and it just look like the straps were tabbed, but the bust was still too big.","A 6 maybe wouldve worked for the bust and hips, but the straps wouldve still been too long.","It arrived on my cocktail party day, so unfortunately, I could not try another dress or another size and went with a dress I had purchased."
"party","I wore this dress to a Christmas party and got so many compliments all night.","It was very comfortable and I felt so glamorous.","It has a very 1930s feel to it.","The sequins under the arms were a little itchy, but I have very sensitive skin and it wasnt bad at all.","After a little bit, I forgot all about it.","I ordered the 6 and the 8 and wore the 8.","It fit a little better on the bottom.","The top fit the same in both.","Im 56, 155 lbs and pear shaped.","The material of this dress is quite stretchy making it very easy to move it.","The length of the skirt was perfect for me.","It his just at the top of my knees.","The top was very flattering to my small chest (34A).","I wore a strapless/backless adhesive bra just for some padding and coverage.","My only con on this dress is the folds that make the back so pretty stick out a bit on the sides, accentuating the hips (an area which I dont need to accentuate).","But I think I was the only person to notice this.","I got compliments all night.","I would definitely order this dress again, maybe in another color next time just for fun.","I loved the green for Christmas!"
"party","This dress is just amazing.","I had a once in a life time opportunity to attend the Grammys and wore this to the festivities.","I cant tell you how many compliments I got - everyone I met was commenting on this dress.","It looks great, feels great and fits great!","I cant recommend it enough.","I will keep this on my short list to wear again!!","!"
"party","I wore this dress for the nieces first birthday party.","It was perfect for a mild summer day, was the perfect length for a family gathering, and the colors were perfectly soft and subtle, yet bright and beautiful for a low-key event.","I got many compliments, even from strangers in the street.","I never felt like the lace was too delicate or was going to catch on things.","If I rented this again, Id make sure to wear it with a nude strapless bra, as my black strapless kept slipping down and showing in the bare midsection.","It was slightly tight in my shoulders and started to chafe my arms after wearing it all day, but it was so beautiful I would endure that again.","My boyfriend, who rarely comments on my clothing, said he wishes I could keep this dress because he liked it so much!"
"party","Dress fit perfect!","True to size and very comfortable.","I wore this to a Black and White wine party it was perfect for the occasion.","So many compliments."
"party","This was a great dress!","The fit was exactly right and the length was great.","All the sequins were in place and I do mean all - it was full sequins.","It did not rub my arms at all and was comfortable for an all day wear.","I would totally rent this again!"
"party","Runs super small!","I sized up and it was still very tight at the band around my ribs.","Otherwise, great material, great wear!"
"party","This dress is beautiful.","It didnt work for the day I rented it for but I will rent again.","May try a different size.","Although it fit, the band in the middle is quite tight so going up might not be a bad idea for the back up but then the top may be loose.","So Id say know your body type."
"party","Fit is fabulous, can wear real bra.","I wore spanx but you could get away without them too.","Super comfy!","Danced the night away!","Loved this dress.......","I was the only girl in gold at a Gatsby Party."
"party","This dress was a show stopper!","Perfect for my birthday dinner party!"
"party","I wore this dress to one of my best friends bachelorette party, the theme was all things that glitter.","So we all rented sparkly dresses from RTR!!","I did follow what everyone said about ordering a size up from what you normally wear.","So i ordered an 18 and a 20.","The 18 didnt fit at all and the 20 zipped but it was extremely uncomfortable without spanks.","I put on shape wear and it was fine just extra tight around the waist.","We were in a group of 8 girls in sparkly dresses.","Heads were turing on the streets of chicago as we walked by!","Even at the end of the night walking home in the rain everyone told us how much they loved our dresses!","We didnt take any full group shots in the dress which was kind of disappointing."
"party","I loved this romper/jumpsuit!","I wish my shoes were as comfortable as this outfit was that evening.","I loved the color, the length, and fit of this piece.","It certainly is a fine quality item!","I was not disappointed.","Its a great choice."
"party","Fits true to size, but hemline was too short for the afternoon party event."
"party","The dress was a medium it fit perfectly except the cuff on the sleeve was quite big and I took a safety pin and tucked it in  on the inside and it was great.","As a women of a certain age I was a little worried it would be too short but I paired it with black opaque tights and bootie and it was perfect.","It was a great color and very comfortable.","I got lots of compliments."
"party","Although I would have preferred one size up, the 6 fit well aside from being a little snug around the cut out.","I think it still was flattering, just the first time I had worn a dress with that exposure.","I was really happy with this dress, and the slightly heavy fabric made it nice for a winter event.","I would highly recommend it!"
"party","Pros: The cut of the bust is gorgeous, and the structure is really well done.","The color is subdue and great for different seasons.","Cons: I saw some of the reviews of girls commenting that the torso was a little short, but it was so short on me I couldnt comfortably wear the piece.","It was strange - I didnt really know what the other girls meant when they left that comment, but essentially in order for the waist to be in the right spot, I had to hike the whole thing up so high that it rode up.","I was surprised because Im not that tall, and I didnt think I had an unusually long torso, but this piece didnt work for me."
"party","Its very pretty, but if you have a chest, go up a bit, unless you want spill out.","The shirt is lacy so you need to wear something under it thats not too revealing."
"party","I am a little bustier than the my avg size - I want without a bra and it fit perfectly."
"party","ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.","It looked better on me because I have curves, though.","Not recommended for thinner girls!"
"party","I have a small bust so this dress was perfect for me but for anyone who has a larger chest it might fit tight around the top.","The stomach part was a bit looser then i had wanted it to be, so i put a yellow belt around it which gave it a bit more color.","All in all it was a nice dress to wear to this birthday party.","Wasnt to much just perfect!"
"party","I have a toddler wearing dresses and having to always bend over and move around can be challenging, this romper was perfect way of wearing something pretty and feminine while still remaining comfortable and easy to move around in."
"party","Wore this to a weekend bachelorette which required one night of neon clothes.","It wasnt the most neon thing in the group, but it did the trick.","Was a cute romper, loved the cutouts, but a little bunchy in the fupa area.","Still would wear it again."
"party","I wore to my work holiday party with jeans and got SO MANY compliments!","Great quality: sequins are secure, material is thick and cozy for cooler weather, not scratchy like other sequin garments.","Couple of things to consider: I have a large chest and small waist, and there are some design features that work against you (loose pockets that add volume right under the chest, elastic gather in the back gives comfort and movement but again adds volume).","The saving grace of this volume is the crop!","Other thing to consider is what to wear under.","I tried about a dozen different tops, and Id recommend something scoop front and silky looking.","I tried dressing down with a cotton T, and it looked very off!"
"party","I rented this dress for New Years Eve--our evening consisted of curry, a hip bar, and a performance by our local symphony!","I felt like this dress was perfect for all three events.","The top fits a little snug, so I wore the Large even though the Medium fit everywhere else.","I got so many compliments on my dress throughout the night--even from strangers!","It was super comfy and paired well with tights and some gold Lotta clogs.","This is definitely one of my favorite rentals of all-time (and I dont say that lightly!",")."
"party","I wore this with a long sleeved, collared, black silk shirt.","The layers played nicely together, and worked well with jeans during the day, black leather leggings in the evening."
"party","Wore the dress for Wore the dress for baby gender revelation.","We were asked to dress our guess.","Husband and I choose to wear pink for a bouncy baby girl.","Dress was very flattering and a beautiful color.","."
"party","Everything about this skirt was amazing!","True to size"
"party","The blousing effect hit me in a weird place - not at my waist but lower so it wasnt as slimming as it could be.","My real issue was the scratchiness of the sequins on my arms.","They were like little knives cutting me all night and by the next day I had scabs forming where I had been cut.","Made me really glad that I didnt OWN this dress."
"party","Can be dressed up or down with heels or a pair of flats.","I paired mine with wedges and chunky earrings."
"party","It did run very long!","I am 56 and even with 2-3 inch heel, it touched the floor.","It was a little big in the waist but was ok.","It was SO comfortable!","LOVED IT!","Would definitely rent again."
"party","The length probably would have been a little inappropriate if I were any taller?","(see photos) I dont know though--- I rented this dress to wear to a fun/sexy event with a crowd of young professionals---it has a classy high neckline + a capped sleeve, which help balance out the length, so my friends totally approved and told me to rock it~~"
"party","I wore this for my bachelorette party.","I got compliments on it all night long, and it fit perfectly.","My only complaint is with the zipper on this dress in this size (I had the 8 as a backup and the zipper worked perfectly on that one).","The zipper on the 10 kept getting stuck, even on the hanger.","It took all of my friends to get the zipper all the way up on me, and that was only after struggling with it on the hanger and then having them help me slip it over my head while zipped up.","Once on, it fit like a glove and stayed put all night long."
"party","This was a fantastic dress.","It fit beautifully.","I wanted something for a formal Sunday brunch, and this worked perfectly.","I am a solid size 8 (sometimes a 6) and the 42 fit perfectly.","Im 57 and wore 3 inch heels and sometimes the dress was slightly on the ground.","I would rent this again in a heartbeat.","My only small compliant is that the underslip is tight and short.","I ended up putting a longer white slip underneath and that solved the problem.","You can tell, however, this is an expensive dress, and it is extremely flattering."
"party","This dress had so many good reviews I was excited to wear it.","I normally wear a ten but that was way too big and the eight was a little large as well.","I ended up pinning the top of it since Im not well endowed enough to fill it out.","If I rent it again Id definitely order a six.","I liked how the skirt fell as it hid any trouble spots, but was really glad I paired it with really high heels since the skirt fell longer on me due to my height.","I did receive a lot of compliments on it and some from people I didnt even know at the semi-formal party."
"party","I am 5’5” and had to wear 3-4” heels in order for the dress not to pool on the ground.","It was still such a beautiful dress and I had so much fun wearing it.","The built in bra was also very convenient.","Great dress to wear in the winter months too!"
"party","This dress was perfect for my company Holiday Party.","I received so many compliments and the fit was great.","Definitely true to size.","The skirt was full but it was cold so it added some extra warmth.","Loved it!"
"party","This dress fit true to size for the most part.","I have pretty wide shoulders and had a little difficulty getting the sleeves in place, but once I did was good for the night.","I also have very long arms and the length of the sleeve was perfect.","Some may find them long.","Also, a little more low cut than it looks in the picture.","Especially if large on top."
"party","I am in the size 2-4 size in tops.","I went with the 4 and it was tight but the larger issue is that it was really short.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"party","the dress fit beautifully -- Perfect/roomy in the bust, a little big around the middle/hips, but that just made it comfortable.","It hit me right at the top of my knee.","Elegant, and fun!"
"party","Very well made.","Stitching is beautiful!"
"party","I loved this outfit!","Very stylish, chic and not to thin to wear during cooler seasons.","The only downside is I wasnt able to wear it because my obliques are my trouble spot.","If you are bloated, your belly may pool out in an unflattering way wearing this outfit.","I wish I was able to wear it and may rent it again after a cleanse rather than after gorging on salty food.","Also, invest in a nice backless bra for this outfit, it is white after all."
"party","I loved the color and fit of this dress!","While it was a bit tight in the rib cage the overall fit was very flattering and comfortable.","I wore this for a work holiday party and received a lot of compliments.","The color of the dress was a beautiful warm green that you cant capture in a picture."
"party","The dress is super comfortable and cute.","I loved everything about it except that the material was kind of cheap."
"party","I ordered 20 but was too big glad i got the 18 as a back up the fit was perfect i am very busty and curvy and it fit like a glove!!!","absolutely lovely and the sparkle was perfect everyone loved my dress!!","!"
"party","I always run between a small and medium depending on the top.","Unfortunately the medium was too large.","This top was far too large in bust, as there is no bra I could have worn with it, and it just was too baggy on top.","A small would have been perfect.","I typically wear a size 6 on top, and usually need a medium for the length due to my height."
"party","Loved this dress.","Everything about it: the length, fit, fabric, style, color.","It fit my body perfect enough that it wasnt too tight, and I could move around comfortably.","It would probably run up if you sat down, but not obnoxiously so.","I would DEFINITELY rent again!"
"party","I usually wear a 2 or a 4 but because this dress is so short I ended up ordering a 4 and a 6 and wearing the 6 - since I had 6 heels I thought the longer dress was best.","Loved it though!"
"party","I do not have a picture of myself wearing the dress, but I do have a picture of when a friend rented it the week prior!","She wore it to my bridal shower and I loved it so much I rented it the following week for another friends bridal shower.","The sleeves were helpful on a cold, snowy, February day.","The length is very appropriate, but not too long.","I wore it with nude shoes.","Everyone loved it, and now everyone is renting it!"
"party","Wouldnt zip at all.","Should have gotten an 8 I guess."
"party","The medium worked also but was a a little short on me.","I am large chested and did not need a bra so dont worry if you are concerned about the lace back.","The bottom rides up a little as you walk but not a big deal.","Overall, Id rent again!"
"party","Ive rented at RTR for years now -- and this is possibly my favorite dress!","Wow!","Both the small and the medium fit well.","I went with the medium so I could be more comfortable during dinner.","The lace is such high quality; its soft to the touch, and the eyelash fringe is perfectly delicate.","The red is gorgeous.","I am pretty choosy about red since I am prone to blemishes.","This red is just the right color.","I wore this to a work dinner and then directly to a party at a bar.","With just a few accessory changes in the cab, it was a hit at both parties.","I was nervous about the see-through portions of the dress for the formal work dinner.","Because the lace was so well done, it was not tacky at all.","Also, the high neck, cap sleeves, and knee length helped with the modesty factor.","I received tons of compliments and did not feel inappropriate.","I felt fantastic!","Then  at the party at the bar it was a standout dress.","Most of the other dresses were sequined or body-con style.","This lovely lace number felt classy and the bold red made it sassy."
"party","I rented the size 8 and size 10.","The 8 fit well, except in the bust.","I wear a 34D and I had to put on 2 strapless bras, as well as stuff with 1 sock each, to get the dress to stay up comfortably.","Probably shouldve gone with the 6 in hindsight.","The dress is really beautiful and the color is fabulous.","It worked out perfectly for the gothic glamour fundraiser I attended."
"party","Most rompers/jumpsuits are difficult to get on/off and this was surprisingly easy.","Perfect size 8, maybe on the larger side.","Im 5.11, 150, and 34D, definitely fit my hippy figure.","I word a strapless bra with this and felt like I could do anything in this outfit.","Well tailored, lined, looks great even after partying until dawn."
"party","I absolutely loved this dress!!!","It was extremely flattering and fit perfectly!","You do need a tape on bra, the material in the front is jersey.","I would definitely rent this again!"
"party","I rented this dress for my holiday work party!","I am a nurse so its fun to get dressed up and show what Im working with under my scrubs!","So I was looking for something flattering without being too inappropriate for my work event.","I have a 38DD chest so it can be difficult to wear dresses with slips, but this one worked for me!","It did crush my chest a little bit, but not overly so.","The sleeves are TIGHT.","I am a long, thin limbed person (I carry my weight in my stomach) and I felt that the arms were too tight.","I had the 10 as my back up size but felt the 8 looked more flattering and I could tolerate the arms.","Like I said, I have long limbs, so the dress is on the short side.","No jumping up and down for me!","The dress is fitted without being tight or boxy.","You can tell there are curves under it.","The sleeves are everything!","So fun and so many compliments.","It was a great color-the only one wearing blue in a sea of black!","Overall, the dress is cute and fun, but appropriate for work and family events."
"party","The dress is very sophisticated.","A little roomy, but a nice conservative piece for a work event or wedding."
"party","This dress fit perfectly and was so comfortable!","Its really stretchy and light-perfect for a summer wedding or party.","I got so many compliments!","I am usually a 6 so I ordered the 6 and an 8 and the 6 was perfect."
"party","When I showed up in this dress, my best friend said, I am so borrowing this from you.","I told her, sorry its going back tomorrow but I am DEFINITELY renting it again!","This is a fun dress that is figure flattering and I got the compliments all afternoon to prove it.","I wore hot pink shoes for a bit of color and it matched the lace at the bottom of the dress as it has a pink undertone to it.","I would not recommend wearing this dress in the summer as the fabric is heavy."
"party","I loved everything about my first rental experience with Rent the Runway.","The lace of first dress they sent was in bad shape so I informed customer service and they overnighted the same dress at no additional charge.","The necklace was also rented, it is Slate & Willows Take the Throne necklace."
"party","This was the perfect dress for a holiday party where I wasnt really sure what the attire would be...its the perfect up-down dress.","very stretchy soft fabric, flattering, probably could be worn by pregnant women."
"party","I got a 2 and a 4.","The zipper is not very smooth, so even with a little pull on a tight fitting dress it would not zip up.","The size 4 worked perfectly.","It gives a nice silhouette with the shoulder pads.","The base material of the dress is like a sweatshirt (heather gray) the black swirl is beautiful on a mesh backing.","Great fun party dress."
"party","i love the length and laser cut details"
"party","though the dress itself fit the ribbon design was sewn on much tighter making the dress difficult to zip.","I ended up wearing a dress 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.","Definitely not curve friendly had extreme difficulty fitting my size Ds in.","If you have curves make sure you order a bigger size!"
"party","Fit is about true to size maybe a little small, otherwise extremely comfortable, great for winter dress"
"party","The 8 and the 10 both fit, as there is some stretch to the material, but I  liked the way the 10 fit better.","The waist hits in just the right place to avoid highlighting or grabbing the belly area.","The straps are really fun.","I didnt wear a bra, and I liked that there wasnt a chance that bra straps would show.","Im not sure if they would either way."
"party","fit well, very comfy"
"party","Typically wear a 14/16.","XL was a great fit.","Dress fits well and hugs and hides all the right curves.","Sleeves were a little snug but after moving around a bit, I hardly noticed.","The split is a little low for a short person which made it a challenge getting in and out of the car.","Had to hike it up to keep from ripping it."
"party","I rented this dress as a larger size backup but as soon as I tried it on, I knew it was the dress I would be wearing for my event!","I usually wear a size 8 but the 10 fit perfectly.","I have a larger bust (36DD) so the bigger size was perfect for me, If you are less busty, I would imagine your usual size would fit perfectly.","The fabric is very lux with a really stunning shine and the color is to die for!","This is a dress I really wish I could have kept!"
"party","Shoulders are super cute, but very loose and big over all.","That is just the style but I felt there was just too much fabric."
"party","Would rent this dress again!!","Perfect for a night out!"
"party","I rent a lot of Elizabeth and James dresses and this was just ok.","I typically fit their size 4 exactly but because the bottom half of the dress is flare the 2 fit me perfectly.","Nothing wrong with the dress but I like to get  show-stoppers from RTR and although this was cute it didnt have the wow I was looking for.","If I owned this dress though Id wear it ALL the time!"
"party","A little scratchy inside."
"party","This dress is absolutely stunning!","Fits true to size and is very flattering.","The arms were a little baggy but the detailing is so beautiful that it didnt really matter.","There isnt any stretch to the dress but it was still comfortable and form fitting in the best way possible.","I would highly recommend this dress for any special occasion!"
"party","This dress was actually a backup that was sent since there was an issue with my original order but it fit great!","It was perfect for attending a spring baby shower.","The only issue was that I would get the short the next time since Im 54 but I wore high platform wedges to accommodate the extra length."
"party","I wore this dress on a Saint Patricks Day bar crawl with friends.","The dress was the perfect weight and the lace was gorgeous.","I felt like it hugged me in all of the right places and gave me an amazing shape while concealing parts of my body I didnt want to flaunt.","Plus it had pockets!","It was perfect and I will absolutely rent it again!"
"party","Fits well and is super comfy.","Good for curvy girls!","I wore mine with spanx because it made me feel more comfy but not necessary for all."
"party","The dress takes 10lbs off you, I swear.","I am 58+ and the dress was definitely on the short side.","Little pricey to rent, but I had a lot of fun it in!"
"party","The fit in the top, the print, and the color were all perfect.","My only critique was with the skirt.","The skirt underneath was pretty short and I had to be careful when sitting because the outer fabric had slits in the front.","The outer fabric was also realllllly long.","Even with wedges, I had to be careful not to trip over it."
"party","I was super excited to rent this for a bachelorette party, but was quite disappointed.","I should have gotten a slightly larger size, but besides that it looked cheaper than I wanted it to.","It was also way too short on my 59 frame.","Im sure its great on shorter gals, but this was a miss for me."
"party","Wore this for a friends bachelorette party in Vegas and it was great!","Was a little too warm/thick of a fabric for 100 degree weather, but I loved wearing it nonetheless!","If you have a larger bust, the V-neck cut comes up pretty high, I was anticipating it to be lower.","Other than that, great dress, has the right amount of stretch, and feels super comfortable on!"
"party","Super flattering, fitted, but not uncomfortable.","I wore this for a rehearsal dinner and after party."
"party","This dress does run large.","Normally I would wear a small or medium but bc of other reviews, I ordered the x-small and wore that.","It was a little bit shorter than the small but it was for my bachelorette party so it was appropriate!","The sequins never bothered me!","It was very comfortable!","I was able to wear a regular push up bra with it as well to give some extra lift!","I loooovvveeeddd this dress!","I would definitely order it again!","!"
"party","Dress fit very nice was a great wear.","However it felt very short.","I loved the dress tho :)"
"party","This is such a beautiful dress, and so fun to wear!","It did run a little big - a size 2 would have been a better fit.","Also the arm holes seemed unusually wide at the back, which may have been fixed by sizing down.","Overall, the cut and quality of this dress are fantastic!"
"party","This dress runs big.","I typically wear a size 8 or medium and ordered a medium and got a small as my back up size.","I wore the small bc it just hugged in all the right places.","The dress has some give to it so it wont show anything.","Im 53 so the length was perfect paired with a set of heels!"
"party","I did not have the option to try a size up (size 6, which I sometimes wear, was not available) so hoped the 4 worked - and it did.","I think this dress runs a bit large, as the 4 was not tight or clingy.","It is short so be ready to rock that, but I liked it and wore nude heels."
"party","I wore this to my company holiday party!","The dress was stunning.","It fit great and was very forgiving.","The cut of the chest area was lower than I expected, but I made it work!","I received a lot of compliments on it.","One note... the material is very heavy... it was great for winter!"
"party","This outfit was very comfortable and extremely flattering!","The back of this outfit is open and even a little open on the side.","Many complements!"
"party","No stretch in the bust.","Not for larger chested women unless you size up"
"party","I ordered both the 4 and 6.","I ended up wearing the 4.","However, I needed two girls to help hold the dress in and zip me up as the tiny zipper gets a little tight around the rib/underbust area.","Yet, the 6 was too large.","Both tops were loose.","I had to safety pin the front to avoid a very low v-neck that would reveal my bra.","Otherwise the perfect Vegas dress for a Bachelorette!"
"party","Love this dress.","It is comfortable, dramatic and chic.","I wore it in navy and rented it in red for a Christmas party.","I felt like a superhero and looked like a super model.","It runs a little large so order accordingly."
"party","Rented this dress for an engagement party.","Great fit and I felt pretty.","As usual no hassle with getting my dress and returning it.","I usual wear a 4-6 and I went with the 6 because it just felt more comfortable and I had room to breathe and eat:) love RTR!"
"party","Dress is very flattering - and a good fit.","boning in the waist area is helpful.","cool, light fabric and easy in heat."
"party","Wore this bright jacket to an art opening.","It kept me warm and helped transition my all black work wear to something fun enough for a party."
"party","Love this dress.","It was so pretty and I got so many compliments.","The only thing I would say is that it was a little long in the 2 and a little bit big in the chest/arms area, I probably could have worn the 0 but overall loved!"
"party","I probably could have worn the size 0, but ordered the 2 based on other reviews."
"party","My 13th year old daughter used it for a neon yacht party.","The dress was a hit; she looked like a Barbie doll.","Not only is this dress elegant but short and sassy for someone of her age."
"party","This is my favorite dress that I have rented so far.","Im mad at myself for not taking a photo in it as it was fabulous.","I received many compliments throughout the night.","It was exactly as I hoped the dress would be.","It is curve hugging, but comfortable at the same time.","If you are blessed on top, you do not have to wear a bra as there is one built-in.","My only recommendation is to go for the long instead of the regular if you are on the verge of the recommended height difference.","I am 55 and a half although I like to round  up to 56.","I should have gotten the long in retrospect.","I wore the 4 for the length,   The next time I have a formal event with different people, I will be renting this dress again!!","!"
"party","I really needed the 8, but they didnt have it so I wore the 6.","Very comfortable (although the 6 was a little tight) and flattering.","The only downside is using the restroom, but I think thats the case for most jumpsuits.","Fun outfit for a birthday party."
"party","I wore this dress for the open bar party that we held the night before our wedding.","Since we had no wedding party, a traditional rehearsal dinner was out of the question.","We invited everyone who was staying in the hotel just to hang out and get to know one another.","This dress fit like it was made for me, and looked fantastic!","I got so many compliments that my mother told me I should buy the dress instead of send it back....and then when everyone else heard it was from RTR they couldnt stop talking about it.","Really made me feel beautiful and confident the whole night.","Definitely a winner!"
"party","It was a great fit I had no problems and It was the perfect legth for the party I was going to.","The pockets made it easy to carry my phone and lipstick with me throughout the night, the color is beautiful and the lace was so nice.","It was extremly comfortable which I appriecated"
"party","This dress was perfect for my Sororitys Founders Day event.","It was a little big but not too noticeable.","The ruffle at the bottom were fun and classy.","I thought with my height it wouldnt work but it was perfect."
"party","The bustline was all stretched out and I had to use a lot of tape and wear a nybra to keep it in place.","Because I am a 34ddd, I have never had to do this before and was disappointed.","The dress is not forgiving and even with spanx, every bump and belly buulge stood out.","I would not rent it again."
"party","loved this dress, such beautiful fabric and a great fit as always with DVF.","The fabric is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable.","loved wearing it for my event."
"party","Fit was perfect balance between classy & sexy."
"party","I rented this dress for my baby shower at 35 weeks and it fit perfectly.","It was definitely short, but short enough that I was able to get away with it.","Loved the bright and springy design and the way it skimmed my belly.","Definitely runs large as I was able to fit into the small at the end of my pregnancy."
"party","VERY flattering.","I dont have much in the boob area, and it loooked great!","Also, not hot like real leather in a very crowded party."
"party","This dress was a bit tight and very low cut on the neckline.","The bottom hugged my curves very nicely, but I dont think I would have been able to dance freely.","Very hard to find the right bra to wear"
"party"," I felt like a runway model!","I ordered the dress in size 10 and 12 and decided to wear the size 12 since I was going to dinner before my event!","The only concern I had was the zipper.","It was a bit sticky...but I managed to get it zipped!","You know sometimes it a bit tough for us Single Ladies to zip our dresses!","I would certainly rent this dress again (midnight blue)!"
"party","I am usually between an xs and a small, but this fit so great.","I loved the way the sleeve draped on my arm and the elastic around the waist was not uncomfortable."
"party","I LOVED this dress!","Would buy it!","Best material ever!","So comfortable and forgiving!"
"party","This dress is adorable.","I wore it for my bridal shower.","Im normally a 6 at 135 lbs 53 but the 4 fit perfect.","Only drawback was the tool lining that irritated my thighs."
"party","Very light and flows- which was great for the hot weather we were having.","I liked the leg slits and it fit my large chest just fine."
"party","It fit like a glove!","It was absolutely perfect to wear to my friends prom.","It was so classy and elegant and looks perfect with simple jewelry, hair and make-up.","The only conflict I faced was the length but that was mostly due to my height haha.","So,  if youre a similar height to me, I recommend getting a R size and a higher heel so it doesnt drag as much!","Other than that, I couldnt have asked for a better dress or a better experience!"
"party","Wore this for a holiday party.","I ended up going with the large for 2 reasons.","(1) the medium was really really short; too short for my comfort level and (2) the bust is kind of small in the medium.","Although the large was baggy everywhere (except the bust) it was comfortable and fun.","I would actually rent this one again."
"party","I rented 2 dresses for my birthday parties.","I had a dinner on Friday and a night out on Saturday.","I chose this dress for Saturday and it was absolutely perfect for dinner and dancing.","The bust line on this dress is extremely flattering and I loved the pockets!!","I received so many complements and was sad to return the dress.","I have an athletic and hourglass figure so I completely filled out the dress.","I would not recommend this dress for large busted women.","I would rent this dress again!"
"party","Cute dress, not an overwhelming amount of sparkle.","I wore this to a New Years party; it was great for dancing and did not get too hot.","True to size--maybe a half size large.","The waste is a little bulky so it added an inch or two.","The plunge is not so bad, I wore with a V-neck bar with no problem."
"party","I rented this fun little number for my birthday dinner out with friends.","Not only was it extremely comfortable, it also garnered tons of compliments.","It was elegant and fun at the same time and perfect for a fall evening out.","The color is beautiful as well.","Id definitely rent this one again!"
"party","Feminine ruffles make this romper a great going out style.","Unlike other Elizabeth and James styles, this romper runs a bit more true to size.","For backup, Id recommend sizing up.","Although the bust is more snug, there is a slight stretch in the fabric that should fit most cup sizes.","The waist and hips are more fitted, so wed recommend sizing up for fuller hips.","At 57, the length hit at about mid-thigh.","Looks great with a pair of black strappy heels."
"party","So fun to wear - the material was so beautiful and silky, and the pattern is beautiful.","My only complaint is how long it was on me (Im 54).","It wasnt uncomfortably long, but just a little bit longer than I expected."
"party","Wore this to a Latin dance.","Clover Canyons dresses will mold to your body, but the material is stretchy enough to move with you.","However, be careful with pulling this dress over your head.","The zipper is short (only about 4 inches).","I have B-cup and Im not curvy at all, but the dress looked great, despite it being more body-con.","It accentuates curves on people without curves, if that makes any sense.","That being said, I would not recommend this dress to someone with lumps or a wide chest."
"party","Loved every minute in this romper!","It was so cute and lightweight.","The material was just perfect and great quality."
"party","Absolutely stunning dress.","Low cut as everyone has said but Im determined to find a way to make it a little more modest for my daughters graduation.","Im between 2 / 4 and Im going to size up to the 6.","The 2 was very tight."
"party","The dress fits a bit tight around the extra material that is around the waist.","Possibly think about going one size up to make sure it fits."
"party","The fit was snug on top but you could still move your arms well, flares at the waist which is flattering for girls with bigger hips/bum!!!","(5.4 and 130lbs)"
"party","I couldnt be happier with my RTR experience.","I picked the dress based on looking at submitted photos and realizing everyone  looked great in this dress.","I ordered a 12 and 14.","I went with the 14 because it gave me a little more coverage on the top but the 12 fit as well.","I cant tell you how many compliments I received!","The dress was so comfortable I didnt want to take it off.","My one concern was that the dress would be in bad condition from prior rentals but aside from a weird smell ( from dry cleaning Im sure - I hung it outside to air out and it was fine)  the dress was perfect.","The whole experience was great and sooo easy.","I feel like I should be a paid spokesperson for RTR because I couldnt shut up all night about my rental dress.","If your not sure about renting - go for it!","you wont be disappointed!"
"party","I enjoyed wearing a dress that wasnt completely white - it was unique.","Id give it 6 stars if I could!","Highly recommend this rental!"
"party","Did not wear but u would definitely rent it again in a different smaller size"
"party","Dress fit fine, but I found that every time I lifted my arms, the straps slipped.","It just made me a little too uncomfortable so I didnt wear it."
"party","Def ran small around the hips and was not very giving material.","Overall it was great and worked for a bachelorette party perfectly."
"party","Once again, RTR did not disappoint!","I rented for our department holiday party.","This dress is made well and was a great fit.","Form fitting but comfortable and able to move all night.","I actually go back and forth between a size 2 and 4, the 4 in this dress fit better in the arms but was a little loose throughout the body, so I went with the 2.","For anyone who is more on the athletic side with muscular arms, I found that the lace in the forearms and upper arms was difficult to get on and a little tight.","This required a little more work to get into the dress, but once on, it was fabulous!","I did love the zippers on the ends of the sleeves though, that helped with the overall fit and look of the dress.","The lace around the neck got a tad itchy toward the end of the night but definitely tolerable and not distracting.","The length on me was spot on, Im shorter so it hit me slightly below the knee which I prefer.","The back is the perfect amount of glamour and sex appeal and was not loose at all.","For me it was easy to wear without a bra.","So beautiful!","I got compliments all night!","Will definitely rent again."
"party","Ran surprisingly large - I got the S and couldve fit into the XS.","Great to wear in the summer because its really light and flowy without swallowing you up or making you look bulky.","100% looks like a dress when on.","The back is great - definitely low-cut, but because of the adjustable tie in the back, you can decide how tight/loose you want the chest to be.","Photographs really well, super comfy, fun to dance in."
"party","LOVED!","Only issue and why I marked as true to size, its wider around the knee area than the photos show, otherwise it fit perfectly.","Paired with tan colored ankle boots, a gold necklace and statement earrings.","Was a winner!","Wish I owned it!","Would definitely rent again!"
"party","I absolutely loved this dress.","The color is great, and the cut is perfect.","It is fitted but flattering.","The asymmetrical hem is trendy and sexy with a little slit up the leg.","The shape of the neck is also trendy and different.","Perfect dress for a party!","I would recommend this dress and would rent it again."
"party","I wore this romper to a gala at the New Orleans aquarium.","The event was fancy, but at the same time, it was not too much of a cocktail party .","This romper was a perfect choice.","It looked really good.","The only bad thing is bending down and making sure that your butt isnt showing when you do bend down."
"party","I loved the top fit but the pants had to much fabric for my liking..it made my hips and legs look bigger than they are.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"party","This dress is HOT!","The 2 fit, but i sized p to a 4 to accommodate my bust as the material doesnt have much give.","The dress is extremely well made and overall pretty comfortable.","I didnt have issues with it riding up or being too warm, as other reviews suggested.","I rented this for a business-related event and it was totally appropriate; I would totally rent again."
"party","Such a flattering fit and hem line.","Very pretty, unique color and I always get tons of compliments when I wear this dress.","This time I wore it for a Kentucky Derby party because it was unseasonably cold and I wanted a light color but still flirty dress.","This was perfect!"
"party","No cons.","Excellent for petite women."
"party","The fit was perfect- I was worried it would be too short but the length was perfect.","I wore it to a Kentucky Derby fundraiser and received many compliments.","Ive always had great luck with Stylestalker dresses!"
"party","We were having tea at the Drake in Chicago for my bridal shower (very iconic), so I wanted a dress to match the occasion.","This one certainly did!","The picture is terrible, I know (lighting was less than ideal for photos), but the dress really does have more shimmer to it than you anticipate (in a good way).","Pockets are always a bonus, and were so great in this super full skirt.","I ordered the 2 and 0 - went with the 2.","The length is lovely, tastefully above the knee and definitely not too short for 3+ inch heels.","Overall, a perfect choice for this occasion!","(Ps.","I saw that another reviewer said it works best with nude shoes - I beg to differ!","I wore this with pink/salmon colored heels and silver and light teal jewelry and the colors looked so cute with it.)"
"party","Love the jacket but the seams are frayed and torn at both shoulders.","Also noticed the stitching on the right sleeve - close to the cuff is torn."
"party","I was invited to a fancy winter ball as someones date, and all eyes were on me with this dress selection.","All through the night I received compliments on the dress intricate details, and my date was not only impressed with the look but way proud of the attention.","To top it off, while outside temperatures were a little chilly the dress material was substantial enough to keep me not feeling vulnerable to the night air."
"party","I have rented no less than 30 dresses from this site over the years and can honestly say that this was one of my absolute favorites.","The colors were beautiful in person and the lace is so feminine and girly.","The dress fits so well and was very comfortable all night long.","I received tons of compliments on this dress.","I would LOVE to own this one."
"party","I wore this top for a Vegas themed holiday party.","I rented size 2 and ordered the 4 as my back up size.","The (2) fit a little better on my in the bust, but was missing so many feathers it looked like a plucked bird!","The (4) had so many more feathers that I decided to wear the (4) instead although it was a little baggy in the arm pits.","It shed quite a bit of feathers, but it was a very pretty expensive looking top.","I enjoyed the rental overall!"
"party","The lining was longer than the actual dress (probably a dry cleaning shrinkage issue), so I had to pin it up.","Otherwise the dress was super comfortable and perfect for the day -- I got tons of compliments."
"party","Fit well - tiny bit small but 4 was too big so it was easy to wear with a little spanx!","Wore a strapless bra because the shoulders cut in too much for covering normal bra straps."
"party","I loved the fit.","I am 57 and wore a 3 heel and could have easily worn the regular.","The Long was almost too long.","From the photos and description i did not realize it had cutouts along the waistline so renters FYI!"
"party","I love the shape and detail on this dress but be warned it runs small.","Im 53, 130 lbs., and a size 4 in most brands but definitely a 6 in this number!"
"party","Was sent this dress overnight because my original choice did not fit, loved it!","The lace on the back of the dress added a great touch to make it classy.","Love, love, love the dress!"
"party","This dress is not like anything I have worn before.","The design is so beautiful for a day time event.","The material is very nice and thick which kind of made me a little hot during this time of the year.","Nonetheless it was a great dress."
"party","I wore this dress to my company holiday party.","The dress was so comfortable and loved the color.","Loved the detailing on the back of the dress as well.","The fabric is thick and stretchy which kept me warm and was also able to move around and dance.","Got many compliments!"
"party","The colors on this dress are artfully placed and gorgeous."
"party","This dress is really pretty!","It is a heavy, sweater-like material, so its good for cold weather.","It does run large.","My main size choice was a medium, but I ended up wearing the back-up XS.","In the pictures of other reviews, the dress looked like it rested above the knee, but it went to my knees.","Also, the material is a little scratchy.","Overall, very pretty!"
"party","This dress is awesome.","It looked beautiful on and the peplum is just enough (not too big) to add detail but still showcase your own figure."
"party","Its a nice dress, but I wasnt blown away by it.","Fits overall pretty well but was a little tight around the ribs."
"party","This is a beautiful dress.","It did run large, and I wish I had ordered a size 8L."
"party","Fitted in the waist, loved the flowing ball gown skirt and the high slit, it also made my chest look amazing.","Sexy and romantic in one!","Ill definitely rent again."
"party","WAY TOO BIG IN THE TOP.","I wear a 32-34A and this dress was not good for that.","The rest looked cute but it was way too big and non-adjustable."
"party","Wore this to a shower.","Fit perfect, well made, looked great"
"party","it is a little stretchy which makes it super comfortable.","im 57 and didnt find it to be too short.","the back is also very cute"
"party","Wore it to a Holiday work party.","It had the right combination of conservative yet sexy.","The dress was pretty fitted in the upper part, however,  I couldnt go up a size because then the waist was too big.","Needed a helping hand to zip it up, but it was comfortable throughout the night.","Was able to even dance a little too.","First time using RTR, and I was a little nervous, but it turned out great!"
"party","Overall the dress was very flattering for an hourglass body shape.","The only slight cons were that the skirt was a bit short (especially for shorter women) and the sleeves were a little tight on the upper arms."
"party","Rented this for my bridal shower.","So gorgeous!","Fit wonderfully and received so many compliments!","Worn with nude heels and gold jewelry!","Loved this one."
"party","This dress is beyond.","It fit like a glove and was so much fun to wear out.","It has zero stretch but it is built to show off all of your curves.","I have very broad shoulders and it fit them perfectly!"
"party","I wore this dress for a black tie optional event.","It fit like a glove and was very comfortable to wear all night long!","I wore a strapless bra and it looked great.","I felt great in this dress and definitely recommend."
"party","Gorgeous detail and nice fit.","Im 53 so the dress definitely was longer on me than shown on the model.","If you want something feminine...this is the dress for you!"
"party","Colors are very pretty and pattern is almost camo looking.","It was not very short but pretty tight in chest area for me, 34DD, only when I was sitting.","Would totally rent again.","Paired it with nude pumps."
"party","This rental dress is amazing and something I would consider purchasing if I had the money.","It fits just right and hugs all the right places.","I like that even though its longer, it has a high slit so it can be dressy or slightly suggestive, depending on what you are going for.","I liked that I didnt have to worry about anything hanging out or any straps showing with this dress.","Would even consider renting again."
"party","LOVED this dress!","Super flattering, the solid part of the dress is a nice thickness and the lace back is super sexy.","Didnt need spanx or a bra!","(and thats unusual for me!)","I would def rent this dress again.","It is short, but just perfect for a night out!","Very comfortable!","I just cant say enough good things about this dress!"
"party","I loved this dress!","Herve Leger dresses are made of a very tight elastic material so it was very form fitting and perfect for vegas.","On the inside of the dress was a strap that clasps like a swim suit.","I think this helped with picking my boobs up a little and helped keep the dress up.","The dress was so much fun and comfortable!","I wore a gold peep toe stiletto with this dress."
"party","I rented this dress for a NYE party that was indoors/outdoors in LA.","I went with the S because it gave a little bit more hem length.","I paired it with some tights and black pumps and it was perfect for the occasion!","The sleeves were a little long for me (as most long-sleeved shirts/dresses are), but it was not a problem because I just tucked about a half inch of the cuff under so that some of it was still showing and no one could tell!","I received so many compliments on the dress and it kept me warm and comfortable all night.","Would rent again!"
"party","Loved this dress!","The blue and black stand out more in person than they do in the picture - the black is actually raised stitching.","Would highly recommend renting this dress!"
"party","I wore this to a disco party in Buffalo, NY.","The style was perfect, but also perfect for non-disco wear, but also incredibly warm and comfortable.","Pleasantly surprised!","Received so many compliments."
"party","I wear 14 in most things and this fit perfectly.","Just the right length, too."
"party","I wore this for my bridal shower.","Ended up wearing the 10 over the 8 as it was just a little more forgiving around the waist.","The nude underlay is a little more prominent IRL than it is in the photos, but the dress still comes off as white enough for a shower/any wedding related party.","Overall a great rental."
"party","Loved the fit.","Very short!","Even for being 54."
"party","Fit was perfect, I loved the pockets!","I think the one thing I was surprised by is that the back wasnt as low as it seems in the pic, but it was still great so no complaints!"
"party","Loved the dress!","My only complaint is that the sequins were a little bit itchy.","I ordered a smaller size for the back-up and ended up wearing that."
"party","Fun short dress for a fun birthday I went to.","Id rent this dress again."
"party","I wore this dress for a rehearsal dinner.","The dress is absolutely gorgeous.","It has beautiful pastel tones and is perfect for any Spring or Summer event.","The dress runs TTS, but it should really be worn by someone that has a defined waistline.","I have a boxy, straight figure, so although the 10 fit me, the upper portion was a tad loose, the sleeves were slipping down, and the waist was a bit snug."
"party","Wore this for a bachelorette party in Nashville, bride wanted us all to wear black.","I like being sexy but comfortable, so I figured this would be a safe choice to show a little skin without being worried Id show too much as the night progressed.","I got the S and M and ended up wearing the S. I think it was perfect.","Fit well, nice quality."
"party","I rented this dress for a charity event.","My usual size fit, although it was a little snug in the arms.","Colors are brighter than in the model picture.","Overall a great and fun dress!"
"party","the dress was very form fitting,  was a little short but for the party I went too was perfect.","It was great for the winter the dress was very thick."
"party","This dress is HEAVY!","But, its because it is so well-structured and it really fits great and hugs every curve.","Im on the taller side and am all legs, so this ended up being a little shorter than I anticipated but it ended up being fine.","If you are very tall, thats definitely something to consider with this dress- definitely spent a lot of time tugging it down, but it wasnt enough of a nuisance to be a real problem.","Otherwise, I thought it fit great everywhere and was really really cool.","Its a good balance between sexy because of the silhouette but also classy-not too revealing- and trendy (duh) which I loved.","Definitely recommend!"
"party","The pants were hanging off me and the back was awesome but hanging open.","I didnt end up wearing it.","So, sad bc its soooo cute!","Size down!"
"party","I ordered the 8R and 6R as backup and really glad i did bc the 6R was perfect length and fit.","I am 58 and 145 pounds, 32DDD and i didnt need to wear a bra!","I wore 3 inch heels with the outfit."
"party","This dress was overnighted to me when another one didnt work for a holiday party.","I will try to stick to Badgley Mischka as much as possible when renting because the dresses have all been comfortable, true to size.","and great for petite girls like me.","I got lots of compliments.","Really liked the ruffle detail.","My only minor complaint is that I am a mom of 3 and it was a bit tight around the tummy area.","Highly recommend overall though!"
"party","The dress is super short if you wear it on your normal size.","It will fit but will be very short, and this is coming from a petite woman.","I wore a larger size, and it was better.","I would not wear it for a family or casual affair."
"party","The color of the dress is beautiful, but it is more pink in person than it appears online.","It fit pretty well and Im glad that I got the tall rather than the regular because it was the perfect hight with heels.","You will not need a bra with this dress.","My two main complaints are with the bust area.","Im a 34 DDD and if you are larger than a C the cups will probably be a little small, and the straps did tend to slide off.","It would have been more comfortable if the straps wen straight down the back instead of wrapping around the shoulders."
"party","It was very tight and I felt comfortable in it.","It is a little long and I felt the top was a tad dowdy, like a nursing bra."
"party","This dress was too long for me.","I am 5 3 and the dress was below my knees.","It was also large on me.","I ended up sending it back."
"party","Very flattering, accented my waist, great fabric."
"party","Perfect party dress!","Fit like a glove and was receiving compliments all night long.","The one con is that it didnt stay up too well.","I was constantly readjusting the top part to make sure that it didnt keep slipping down."
"party","I am a size 4 in about 80% of my dresses, and a size 2 in the rest.","I would say this dress runs a tad bit large since the size 2 fit perfectly."
"party","Fits true to size."
"party","Fantastic color, wonderful quality lace.","Super elegant and flattering."
"party","This dress is perfect for any kind of event.","You can really dress it up with a pair of high heels and a clutch.","Or you can dress it down with black chunky boots or high heel knee boots paired with either a leather jacket or a furry vest.","The possibilities are endless and Im completely obsessed with this dress and cant wait to wear it!"
"party","This dress runs somewhere in between true to size and small depending on your body type.","I wear anywhere between a size 8 and a size 12 depending on the fit of a dress because of my large hips.","I ended up wearing the L, and it fit like a glove (There isnt much stretch to the fabric).","I have received tons of compliments and I was comfortable all night."
"party","This dress is perfect: perfect knee length, fabric, and style.","I would definitely rent this again."
"party","The sequins definitely scratched my arms a bit, but other than that it was pretty comfortable.","The length was great, and it didnt ride up at all.","Im not used to such a low cut neckline, but hey, it was perfect for a night out in Vegas!","And I was able to wear just a regular bra with the dress, which was awesome."
"party","I typically wear  20W or 22W depending on the dress, so I ordered a 22W with a 20W as my backup.","The 20W fit nicely.","The dress runs large and is long - even the 20W came past my knees and I wouldnt consider myself short.","I was worried about looking matronly, but that was remedied by the right hair, jewelry and shoes.","I wore the dress with a sticky bra (didnt have to worry about the band peeking out the back) and didnt feel the need to wear shapewear of any kind."
"party","I wasnt sold on this dress when it arrived - from photos (even real photos) it looked less pink and frilly.","There is a slight texture / overlay that reminds me of a very simple lace in person, and Im short and petite but with hips/tummy so the bubble of the skirt really accentuated on me.","It wasnt NOT flattering, it just didnt lay the way I imagined.","The cap sleeves and neckline are lovely and very flattering on any body type Id imagine, but length/skirt wasnt my favorite.","Im a bit busty so the 6 would have fit me perfect otherwise, but I had to go with the 8 for bust to not pull - and I think that size up added to my skirt concerns of length and fit.","Id say for body types like mine (short legs, busty but petite upper) it really falls in between sizes.","But - I got many compliments on the quality and beauty of the dress, it ended up working out great and looked pretty in photos.","Chunky necklaces and nude shoes looked great with it as well.","And a pretty scoop back."
"party","I originally was going to wear the Forrest Jumpsuit but because it was returned without the belts, RTR fantastic customer service team sent me this dress as a backup.","Im glad they did because I loved it so much I wore it instead!","Other reviewers are right - it does run small.","But it IS a tight look to begin with, so I think this dress is best for events where extreme movement is not necessary.","I loved how it looked and even though my venue got double booked with another party, I still felt like a kween <3"
"party","The dress is so chic!","Love the pockets!","It looks better when youre standing still.","My shoulders and hips are about the same width and the dress kept bunching at the hips when I walked.","I would recommend getting one size larger than you typically wear."
"party","This dress is a perfect basic.","The size 2 was a little loose around the hips/waist but otherwise fit great.","Dressed it up with a multi-colored scarf.","Got tons of compliments and felt great."
"party","It fit perfectly."
"party","loved the fit.","most rompers/jumpsuits hit my waist in an unflattering way, but this one sat right where it should."
"party","I rented this dress as my free dress for my birthday.","We planned to go to a wine tasting at a nice restaurant after work during the week.","I wore this dress to work and then out for dinner and drinks with family and friends.","It was so comfortable.","I did wear a cardigan over it because it was a cooler day.","I am short so the length was perfect for me.","If you are taller it might be too short.","Fit true to size.","So happy with my rental and my membership."
"party","Sexy asymmetrical fabulousness!","This is not a dress for the meek; the deep V in front and back means no bra, only some tape, and youre gonna be all on display.","Go for it, though, youll look great.","Its a little tight in the hips but overall lays well as long as you stand up really straight!"
"party","This dress was perfect for my New Years party!","I got a lot of compliments.","Im really curvy and I have huge boobs (36G), so finding things that fit properly can be difficult.","But the slight stretch to the fabric in the dress really made it flatter my curves.","I let my friend borrow the backup size and it looked great on her too!","(Im the one on the left)"
"party","Absolutely love this dress!","Its so easy and can be worn with heels or sandals.","I wore it to work and to a Wedding Shower.","Got so many compliments!","Runs big so I suggest sizing down."
"party","I am known for being a big nerd, so this spacy dress was perfect for a work party.","Both dresses had some wear and literal tear on them, so I took the one with the tear in the arm seam rather than the tear in the back zipper.","I could wear both the small and medium very comfortably, and the mediums sleeves were amazingly long enough--almost too long!","Tight, heavy material kept me warm in the lake-effect snow."
"party","I rented this dress to wear out in Vegas.","It was great for a night out, fun but classy at the same time."
"party","Great mini dress.","I wore it in the winter with heels and tights.","Its warm, but still fun.","Warning: It has NO give whatsoever and its VERY VERY short.","Dont expect to sit :-) !","I usually lean toward a 4/S in dresses.","This one needed a 6 (up in size).","All in all, I think it turned out sassy and classy all at the same time!"
"party","The dress was BEYOND flattering.","I was super nervous about renting this dress because Im not one to wear super super body-hugging dresses like this, but it was awesome.","The pattern took attention away from areas I was self conscious about and I received compliments all night.","It was also great because I was able to dress it up or down, as I wasnt sure how fancy the party was going to be."
"party","This was my back-up dress and I totally loved it.","I dont know why I ordered an XL in it but It was big and I probably would have been just as comfortable in a L.  I would totally recommend it to anyone.","I wore it to a holiday party and everyone loved it."
"party","I wore this for my bridal shower that had a Victorian goth theme in October.","This dress was an endless hit!","People kept coming up to me complimenting it the whole party!","And tip: it has pockets!","I realized it about halfway through the party.","Its pretty true to size, but you might need a little help in the breast area if you are a C or smaller."
"party","Very comfortable especially if you have a bigger bust"
"party","It was really comfortable to sit in and didnt bunch at all.","The cold shoulders stayed down and the flowy sleeves were really fun.","It was a fun and flirty dress that wasnt too scandalous to wear around coworkers.","Lots of complements!"
"party","This definitely shows some skin on someone with a larger bust, but for a bachelorette party, it was perfect.","The shape of the skirt is flattering and fun."
"party","Very flattering, not too tight in the midsection but not boxy.","The only con was the sleeves were just a little too long."
"party","I really have nothing bad to say about the dress.","The only thing is when you get the long, make sure you wear heels!","!"
"party","It will hug all your curves.","I wasnt comfortable with putting all that out there."
"party","I rented this for NYE and it was perfect!","Im about 55 and 111 pounds.","I could have worn the zero, but the sleeves were pretty tight and I wanted to be able to dance.","The size two fit well, but I found it to be a tad big in the waist area, but nothing very noticeable so thats what I went with.","I would rent this again!"
"party","The dress was absolutely gorgeous and I would highly recommend it for anyone attending a rehearsal dinner, Bachelorette weekend or cocktail party!","!"
"party","Top was large on me, had to wear padded bra."
"party","The fit was nice, a little hard to get in and out of but I figured it out"
"party","So, I am a vet for RTR.","It is my go-to for any event or fun weekend I have planned.","This is the first time that there was an issue..  DONT WORRY... it turns out OK.","Unfortunately I ordered the Vita in a M & L.  A few days before receiving my order, I was informed the girl before me ruined the L & they only had the M (which they were still sending)  Customer service was great trying to help me find an alternate with the limited inventory they had 5 days before NYE.","Anyways, onto the dress :-) --> So I received 3 different dresses & the Vita by far fit my body type the best.","My only concern was the length & having to pull it down.","I was reassured by customer service (who actually wore the dress)  that it was not an issue for her... and it barely wasnt an issue as I thought it would be.","A few adjusts here & there, but nothing more!!","As always, I received COUNTLESS compliments on my RTR dress.","Sleeves fit great, dress hugged in all the right places to show my figure.","You are OK with a black bra underneath.","I just wore a strapless & was very comfortable all night.","Accessories: Wore the AV Max - Gold Tetra necklace, The Oscar de la Renta - Large two crystal ring in Indigo & a staple black patten leather heel.","The dress needs to be the center point, so just a few accessories & your good to go!"
"party","I wasnt able to wear it because it was to hot the day i need to wear it.","i guess i will have to rent it again."
"party"," I really loved this dress but it was a little revealing for the event I was going to.","I would rent it again in a heartbeat.","Definitely needs fashion tape!"
"party","This dress does sexy perfectly.","It was really flattering in photos, and stunning in person.","I usually wear a 0 or a 2, but the 2 was definitely too big -- you want this dress to hug you, especially since its stretchy.","It could have been more fitted in the waist for me, but was tight around the hips -- but that might just be my body.","The length hit me a little below the knees, but it rides up as you walk (as most dresses this length does)."
"party","This dress is adorable!","I like to size up in wrap dresses/ DVF runs a bit small, so I went up a size in this dress and it worked well.","I pinned the neckline for a work event and left it unpinned for a party.","Its perfect for fall and would be cute with navy tights too.","I personally loved the flared skirt, though I could see how it might not be for everyone.","If you are tall/curvy it can run on the shorter/bustier side, but the bust is easily made more modest with a safety pin or tape, and its definitely not too short."
"party","This dress was great - super comfy to wear to a baby shower on a hot afternoon!","The only thing I would caution is that it is very low cut - I ended up using individual adhesive chicken cutlet type of things instead of a regular bra.","Other than that I loved it, would totally rent again!"
"party","I got this and one other white dress as options for my Bridal Shower.","This dress fit my athletic frame well even though the capped sleeves were a bit tight (ie I couldnt raise my arms over my head, entirely).","I didnt end up wearing it because the fabric has significant weight to it and my bridal shower was taking place in 88 degree weather with 80% humidity.","So....","Ill keep it bookmarked for another time!"
"party","The fit was so perfect and it was actually really comfortable.","I would say, and this has been mentioned in other reviews, that going to the bathroom was a little complicated as first.","Eventually I got used to zipping and unzipping it myself, though!","I thought it ran true to size.","I usually wear a 4 and I wore a 4 in this."
"party","Gorgeous dress!","Great quality and beautiful blush pink contrast, chic detailing at the neck.","I will absolutely rent this one again.","I ended up not going to the event that I rented this beauty for, but I would have sized down to the 2.","The smaller size fit a bit more snug around the waist and was about an inch shorter -- I live in Miami, its hot!"
"party","The dress was a huge hit!","I definitely make a mark in each bar I walked into- its a pretty unforgettable dress.","The arms are a bit itchy and the material doesnt breathe.","I got super hot in the crowded bars, but turned peoples heads for sure!","The material is very stretchy, so I would order a size down.","I wore a small and it fit well, but loosened by the end of the night."
"party","I wore this for my wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner party which was held on a boat.","Everyone told me how great the dress was even my uncles and people who dont normally comment.","The work is well detailed and stands out.","It was fun to wear, comfortable and looked great!","Would totally rent this again!"
"party","I love this dress -- I bought it the second it arrived, before I even had a place to wear it to.","It fits perfectly and is a very flattering cut.","Just be aware that it does dip pretty low, and it has a high slit that sometimes opens on the leg.","I got tons of compliments on the dress and am now trying to find another event to go to this weekend just so I have an excuse to wear it.","Love!"
"party","The dress fit like a glove.","I ordered the 10 and wore that size.","It was really tight , but not so tight that it became  uncomfortable.","I felt amazing in it and received a lot of compliments."
"party","Dress was lovely and great for a party.","It was stylish but not showy.","I was comfortable all evening but didnt have to sacrifice looking put together."
"party","Loved this dress!","Perfect for an engagement party.","It had the perfect about of stretch and a perfect canvas for funky accessories."
"party","I never would have taken the chance on this dress and ordered it online without trying it on, but was able to go to a store and try it on and loved it!","Its not super easy to wear since the back detailing makes wearing a bra difficult and the length might be a bit long on some.","The real beauty in the dress is both the back detailing and how it moves, Ive never worn a dress that was so much fun to twirl around in!","It looked very sophisticated at my formal holiday party and I would definitely wear this dress again."
"party","Very comfortable- not too fitted but fitted enough."
"party","I wore these in combination with an ugly christmas sweater and got tons of compliments!","The only issue was one of comfort.","I honestly couldnt figure out if I was wearing these pants backwards (I wasnt) because the front had space for a rear-end, too!","LOL if that makes sense.","Im not sure if the pair I got was actually worn backwards by a previous renter or what, but the front was droopy while everything else fit perfectly!","If youre wearing a long top and wont be sitting a ton, I highly recommend!","However, if your top isnt long enough to cover the front top or if youll be sitting a lot (aka very uncomfortable sitting)...","Id pass and get actual leggings instead!"
"party","(Picture is of me sitting down on the DC metro, so it doesnt do it justice!)","The dress is extremely flattering and falls about mid-thigh.","I wore it for a friends bachelorette party at an outdoor concert, and it was light-weight and kept me cool on a hot summer day at Wolf Trap in VA.","I would ABSOLUTELY wear this dress again!","Loved it so much."
"party","The dress was a bit tight through the chest but too big around the shoulders and the sleeves were too long for me.","The fabric was very luxe and did not cling to my tights."
"party","I rented this for my 30th, it was great and different because it was a romper and the color was gorgeous in my pictures.","I was getting compliments all night long.","Be sure to wear a seamless underwear, I couldnt wear my strapless bra because of the cuts, I wore pasties and when I zipped it up the romper held up me great.","I went with a M, it fit true to size.","A really really great choice!","!"
"party","The dress was super comfortable and not stiff.","The sequins didnt irritate my skin at all.","Its definitely a grey color however its gorgeous.","Also, it photographs beautifully."
"party","This jumpsuit was super cool & fun.","It was really comfortable and I got a ton of compliments on it, definitely recommend it!"
"party","The dress is definitely on the looser side but is super short so showed off my legs.","The sequins are almost light pink (in the picture I thought they looked cream).","Very pretty dress"
"party","I think I was predisposed to loving this dress.","I have the Yumi Kim romper in almost the same fabric which I love.","I picked this out for my baby shower and I did not want to return it.","This was so comfortable and covered the bump (30 weeks) so well!","I went with my back up size of medium because the small wouldnt fully cover the bump.","It was a little low cut but I am chesty so I am used to it.","I wore a black slip underneath and it looked fantastic.","I highly recommend!"
"party","This dress is STUNNING in person.","The fabric, the fit, the movement - its all beautiful.","I also love that its feminine and sweet, but at the same time, its super sexy, too :) Obsessed.","You can see more photos here > http://www.lakeshorelady.com/2015/08/rent-the-runway-rachel-zoe-beck-dress.html"
"party","The dress feels so well-made and I love how it hugs my curves.","Plus, the colors are just as bright as they look in the picture -- be prepared to stand out!"
"party","Very comfortable.","Not too short."
"party","I wore this dress to a charity casino night.","The material had a little elasticity which allowed the dress to hug my curves perfectly.","I received so many compliments throughout the night.","Only downside is the straps are very loose as other reviewers mentioned.","They were not following off of mu shoulders but I would have liked for them to be a little tighter to hold up my chest more.","Other than that it was a great find that I would definitely rent again!"
"party","Perfect fit and flare style!","If you are tall it might be a little short!","Very comfortable!"
"party","This was a backup gown, which I never would have chosen, but I looked morbidly obese in the original gown.","Two girdles later I was lookin fine.","This dress is extremely flattering.","Got compliments all night."
"party","Love the fit-and-flare look of this dress.","Its flirty and fun!","Perfect bachelorette party dress.","It was a little longer than I expected, even though I have long legs."
"party","Very flattering dress.","Especially if youre small chested.","It was a little long for me and Im 57.","I think this would be perfect for older women or tall girls."
"party","Love the fabric and colors.","Unfortunately I couldnt wear it, it was a little loose and longer than I would like it"
"party","The overall fit was great, except it ran smaller than what I typically wear.","It was a little tight around the hip area, but it was flattering for my hourglass shape.","It fit well on the shoulder and was the perfect length with a 3heel."
"party","very bold color and good for holiday party!","everyone loves my dress!!","!"
"party","No problem getting the dress on, and once it was on it was comfortable, figure flattering and super easy to wear.","Really tight in the waist compared to the rest of the dress and had to have someone else pull it off over my head, not a big deal though its still a great dress."
"party","This dress was the perfect size.","The zipper was hard to get up all the way.","Got many compliments!","It was hard to find shoes that match because the color is like champagne with silver flecks."
"party","I wore this dress to my ships holiday party and I got compliments all night.","The fabric hugged all my curves but was still conservative enough for a work function.","Its a great basic black dress that you can pair with more statement jewelry.","I felt beautiful and I loved wearing it."
"party","This was an awesome dress.","The length was perfect for a formal-ish outdoor party and the fabric was beautiful - the quality of the fabric met the expectation which I really appreciated (sometimes expensive dresses can feel so cheap!).","The chest area was a *little snug*, but the arms were fine.","I wore the 2, my regular size and it fit me perfectly!","I would highly recommend this dress - very classy and pretty!"
"party","While the size 6 fit nicely, my butt was a lot more comfortable in the 8 haha.","Im glad I ordered a roomier backup!","This dress was awesome, the lining was so comfortable and I felt amazing.","I would definitely order this again."
"party","Pros: cute, comfy, versatileCons: bit of a boxy fit"
"party","This dress was perfect for the cocktail event I attended.","Very, very pale pink and I did wear a strapless bra.","Super form fitting which isnt typically my style but I was still comfortable."
"party","Fit perfectly.","Form fitting and body hugging, but comfortable ."
"party","I wore this out to clubs in Vegas in February and it was wonderful.","I loved everything about it.","The pattern of the dress conceals any bumps or imperfections that you might be trying to hide.","The back of the dress makes your ass look phenomenal - the solid pink line down the back is perfect.","Last thing, I would definitely recommend that you squeeze into the Small if youre on the edge of a Small and a Medium."
"party","Dress is very long"
"party","I wore this to my boyfriends work Christmas dinner and I received compliments on it from the moment I walked into the door (not kidding).","I loved the pockets and the detail at the hem.","I normally wear a size 4 but ordered 2 as my backup size and the 2 fit perfectly."
"party","I loved this dress.","I saw that it seemed to be really short, but since I am short, it worked out.","The dress was about mid/lower thigh on me.","The fit was great!","It was comfortable to wear all night and looked amazing!","Since I am small enough up top, I just didnt need to wear a bra, so the back opening wasnt an issue as all.","My only complaint is that the hooks that hold the top more/less together seem to always look they are busting open!","No matter how high up or low you hook them.","Not a huge deal, but seemed odd since I know I was not bursting at the top - there was plenty of room."
"party","Loved this unique pattern and texture!","I would recommend sizing up, particularly because the slits are deceptive on the sides!","I was planning to wear it for work, and then when I sat down I noticed the side slits cut up too high, so I shifted it to a cocktail party I had that weekend.","I was very glad I was mostly standing that night, because the slits definitely creep up.","I loved wearing it, but would probably go up a size to have it be a hair longer for my own preferences."
"party","I loved this dress!","It is fit beautifully.","It hides any tummy.","It is long in the torso for me but I was able to pull it off.","Great for girls with curves!","!"
"party","This romper is awesome!","Im not usually wild about rompers because theyre not overly flattering on my body type, but this one was perfect.","I wore it on my bachelorette party and received tons of compliments.","I would absolutely recommend this to anyone thats on the fence about it.","I ordered an XS and a S and wound up going with the XS because it fit perfect."
"party","I really liked this dress.","I rented 2 and chose the other one, however, this one was so pretty!","It was a bit long and came down to my knees.","I was looking for a shorter number for this party.","Fit well in the arms and loved the fabric!"
"party","I wore this for a rehearsal dinner.","The color is beautiful.","It was a little snug in the hips and the fabric doesnt have much give, so I wore a 10 instead of an 8.","This meant the top was a little bigger than I would have preferred.","I didnt feel like I had enough support without a bra (maybe would have felt different in the smaller size), but I wore a nubra and felt comfortable all night.","The dress showed a little more cleavage in the front than I realized, but with the fabric overlay, it was not as obvious.","The detail on the back is really gorgeous-- it has very detailed flowers and lace and not just a mere opening.","The detail is beautiful.","So many people complimented the color and back."
"party","Really small on the chest"
"party","I loved this dress!","I wore it to a date party for my sorority and it was such a hit.","The back is even cuter and person and I got so many compliments.","I definitely sized down for this dress, the dress fit better in the bust with the smaller size.","Overall, really flattering and a great dress!","I would rent it again in a heartbeat!"
"party","I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the detail on this dress!","It runs large up top, and true to size in the bottom.","The hips were more comfortable in the 2, but due to how big the top was, I went with the 0.","I will be renting it again!"
"party","Both the 6 and 8 fit, but the 8 was longer and gave me more room for a big dinner.","Loved the dress, comfortable style."
"party","AWESOME!","very high quality fabric and fits really well.","Somewhat difficult to unzip to use the bathroom, I needed assistance every time.","but the cut outs are really cool and its a really really great outfit to wear!","10 stars!"
"party","One issue I had with the dress was a small tear on the back slit from a previous wear that continued to grow when I walked.","Being petite, the dress did hit right at my knees which also made it a little difficult to walk in.","Overall though, the dress was perfect for my birthday dinner; RTR made my Easter weekend a great one!"
"party","I wore this dress to an anniversary party, and was very comfortable the entire evening.","The fabric is giving, but high quality.","Made in Italy.","The one shoulder gives this dress great flair.","I would definitely recommend this rental."
"party","Work holiday party.","Loved wearing this dress.","The size was spot on, but as many dresses like this, I found it hard to get the zipper up over the seam around the waist.","I needed help.","The embroidery is gorgeous, the neckline hugs perfectly and the length was so stunning with heels.","The sleeves were a little itchy because of the fabric as someone else mentioned, but it was tolerable."
"party","Beautifully made dress that is extremely comfortable to wear.","I wore this dress to a party and received tons of compliments and questions about who makes the dress and where to buy.","The cut out on the side sits perfectly right above your waist so that you dont feel like you need to suck it in and you can wear any bra with it - always a plus."
"party","This dress fit wonderfully and was very comfortable.","I received many compliments on it during the event (a bridal shower for my sister) and I would definitely consider renting it again.","I kept my accessories simple but I think it could have looked great with a belt or a large necklace.","Would definitely recommend this dress!"
"party","I wore this dress to my office holiday party.","It fit me perfectly, and because the dress is very lacy, I didnt have to do too much to accessorize.","I received tons of compliments and would definitely rent again.","One word of caution: the sleeves are narrow and do not have stretch so may be too small/tight for some."
"party","Comfy and adorable.","Rented this for my high school reunion.","It was sparkly but not overly fancy.","I dressed it down with combat boots and an oversized sweater coat.","Got lots of compliments.","The shoulders stayed in place all night and I didnt have to shimmy to adjust the dress at all."
"party"," It went perfectly with the dirty 30s theme- was slightly lose but a smaller size would not have fit.","Only con was by the end of the night the insides of my arms were red from the sequins rubbing against them!"
"party","I ordered the 0 and 2, and ended up wearing the 2 because the 0 was SO short.","The 2 was still very short, like no bending, reaching, or arm-lifting.","But I loooooved the dress, so it was worth it.","I got so many compliments!"
"party","Very comfortable and simple yet stands out in a crowd."
"party","This dress was total glam!!","When I ordered it, I thought it would be more white, but it was definitely more silver.","The entire thing is sequins but VERY comfortable and flattering.","I wore this for my bridal shower and everyone loved it.","The back is very low so plan for that when selecting a bra - which I think most will need as theres no front support in the dress.","Im 59 and usually struggle with shorter dresses as they are generally much shorter on me than others, but this was the perfect length - just above the knees.","Would totally order this dress again and suggest to anyone looking to feel all things - glam, beautiful, comfortable, dressed up."
"party","I wore this dress for my rehearsal dinner and absolutely loved it!","I ordered this dress as well as a white dress, but liked this one far more than the other dress.","This dress was the perfect length and I loved the cap sleeve.","I ordered both a size 6 and a size 4 and ended up wearing the 4.","The A-line skirt was still nice and loose around my hips and the top of the dress felt like it fit better with the 4 (I usually wear a size 6).","It also has pockets which was a nice little surprise!"
"party","Got both the 0 and the 2, the 2 fit better on bottom, but the 0 fit better on top.","Rent this and be prepared to impress!","!"
"party","No cons.","It fit well and looked greaton my frame."
"party","I dont know if it was because of the holidays or that I have a wider rib cage, but this dress was too small for me.","I usually wear a size 4 (I am a little more to love)  but I couldnt zip this one all the way up and therefore couldnt wear it out, but I love the dress and the pattern/color.","Next time I would get a M size."
"party","Required a safety pin in the top, but very comfortable."
"party","This dress is gorgeous, but the front is VERY low cut.","No bra can be worn with it the way it is.","But a few pins here and there fixed it right up!"
"party","shows all the belly flaws"
"party","This dress was incredibly comfortable, incredibly lightweight, and just gorgeous colors!","It runs on the small size so I ended up wearing the medium instead of the large and it fit great.","Would absolutely rent again!"
"party","Wore this one to an inaugural ball.","I usually wear a 10 or 12 depending upon cut and brand, and the size 10 fit easily, so Id say the sizing on the dress is on the generous side.","Great to be able to wear a bra with straps -- found one that was low-cut enough in front for the deep V-neckline.","RTR, thanks for including the fashion tape, which kept the dress rated PG-13.","No need for Spanx or any uncomfortable undergarments.","The 10L was just barely long enough for me.","In bare feet the hem just slightly grazed the floor, so I wore a low heel (whch was fine with me.)","I was surprised by how not-pokey the sequins were, and grateful that I didnt walk around shedding them all night.","Good engineering by Badgley Mischka, I guess."
"party","I rented this for my birthday and LOVED it!","The 8R fit perfectly in all the right spots.","Overall it was a super flattering look.","The material is nice and thick, so I didnt have to wear a bra.","It was easy to move around in all night, and the all white was definitely a show stopper!"
"party","The thick luxurious fabric makes this dress super flattering and so comfortable!","It was stretchy and form-fitting, but I was comfortable in it all night.","I wore it with sneakers to dress it down, but I do think heels would have made it a nicer, more put-together outfit.","I wore it with silver ear cuffs, but no other jewelry.","The other great part of this dress is that even though it was pretty thick, I wasnt hot, even while dancing!"
"party","Ive worn many many many Medium/6/8 jumpsuits at 510.","This one didnt come close to fitting my leg - the length came barely below my knee and was very tight around my thigh/crotch area.","Very disappointing for an elegant style."
"party","I wore this to a holiday cocktail party, and it was great.","I felt really elegant in this without looking like I was trying too hard.","I wore with a long gold pendant, and I loved the off the shoulder look.","I know others have complained about the arms being tight, but it was perfect for a cocktail party and didnt bother me at all."
"party","What girl doesnt need a gold sparkly dress?","I loved this dress and received more compliments than I ever had wearing  any other dress.","This was my first RTR rental so I was nervous, but the dress was perfect.","I ordered 2 dresses - a size 8 and 6 - which seemed almost identical except for the coloring.","The sequins on the size 6 had more brown tones, which I liked.","The slit up the back of the dress made spanx a challenge, but it was worth it.","(Im tall, so its always a challenge.)","The dress was comfortable to wear all evening - a big plus in my book.","I only wish that  I would have ordered accessories because this was so different from other dresses that I wear, I really did not have anything to go with it."
"party","This dress is so unique and lovely that you dont need to do much more once youve got it on!","I was a little concerned about how form-fitting it was, given that I dont usually like showing off my tummy, but with a little help from some spanx and nude tights, it was perfect!","It ran a bit shorter than I anticipated (Im 56), but I think thats because my hips and booty kept making it ride up a bit.","My boo couldnt keep his eyes off me, and the color, although a bit brighter than it appears on the website, is easily muted in a darker room/late evening event.","Word to the wise--be ready to go strapless, and have a friend around to help you zip up the back!","If I could do it over again, i think I would have gone for a corset shaper to wear under the dress instead of spanx and a strapless bra, just to smooth everything over, but overall Im very happy with my choice!"
"party","Loved this dress!","I wanted a LBD for a Christmas office party and this was perfect.","Very comfortable and not too tight (especially given that I have wider hips).","The neckline was unique and created a little extra wow factor.","I paired this with black heels and silver drop earrings, but this could easily be paired with any accessories or colors.","My husband said it was sexy, but it was also modest and appropriate enough for an office party.","Highly recommend it!"
"party","I couldnt find anything wrong with this dress.","It fits perfectly!","The fabric is high quality and its comfortable to wear.","Its very classy!"
"party","This dress hugged all my curves and made me feel amazing all night.","I received several compliments.","Its a very unique style, which made it stand out.","The lining is like sweatshirt material, which made it a bit warm, but cozy and the thicker fabric worked a bit like spanx - smoothing out any bumps from the pizza I scarfed pre-party.",":)  Its SHORT so I couldnt bend over - but I was moving around all night and didnt notice.","Great dress."
"party","After reading lots of reviews, I decided to order smaller sizes (0, 4) than I normally would because of renters stating that the bust area was a bit larger.","I am pretty small chested (34A).","The 4 fit perfectly!","It was not tight on my chest, but could be worn with a sticky bra.","It also was not too short - it hit right above my knee.","This dress is the perfect balance between sexy and modest.","The back really is the best part of the dress, but you can jazz it up with a chunky or long necklace in the front.","I was planning to wear this for a bachelorette party and was so sad when I couldnt attend.","I would definitely consider renting this again!"
"party","Will fit like a glove but possibly run too small as there is very little wiggle room.","Strangely, I had a 4 as backup though and it had the exact same tightness as a 2 so I ended up just wearing the 2.","It was not too uncomfortable but a little difficult to dance in.","It is a skater dress, so it will be above your knees.","Be very careful what jewelry you pair with it as anything with clasps or chains can catch on the lace easily.","The color is more like a rich indigo blue.","I received so many compliments on its vibrancy.","Pairing with bold black/onyx jewels made for a striking ensemble."
"party","The color of this dress is beautiful, and I loved the shoulder strap detail.","I didnt end up wearing it because it wasnt formal enough for my event.","Also,the top of the pleats landed in a strange place on me, which I found unflattering."
"party","Very comfy and flattering simple knit dress.","My only complaint is that the waist is kind of low (almost a drop waist).","I would definitely recommend for a long-waisted person."
"party","I would absolutely rent this dress again!","It fit like a glove, felt high-quality, and looked great.","I was nominated for an award, and knew I would be photographed whether I won or not, so I had to look good, right?","Well, I won, and ended up on the front page of the paper in this dress!","Whew!","Its tight enough in the bodice that I was able to skip a bra.","If I hadnt, not sure what I would have done.","The dress cuts in in the front and back, and a bra would have shown."
"party","the fit was a bit snug, but as it should be - it is such great quality.","the only dissapointment was that the dress had obviously been dry cleaned many times and the color quality was not top notch."
"party","Love the shape, print and color on this dress.","I would usually wear a 38, but ordered a 40 and 42 because it runs small.","the 40 wasnt available, so I wore the 42.","It looked really good, but the 40 would have been the perfect fit."
"party","The dress arrived with a small hole in the beading on the front but wasnt too noticeable.","Glad I was able to get two sizes because the 4 was a little tight and wouldve made for an uncomfortable night of dancing!"
"party","I wore this to a day to night outside party.","The material is light and comfortable and the colors are amazing!","I will defiantly be renting this again!"
"party","Definitely help closing the clasps on the collar."
"party"," I received many compliments on this dress.","It felt very stylish and stunning while standing.","I did have some trouble when seated however.","If I didnt pull the dress up slightly as I sat down, the dress would pull on my neck and feel a bit awkward.","Overall, I would highly recommend this beautiful dress for most semi-formal occasions where youll likely to be standing most of the time."
"party","I wore this for a Christmas brunch as well as a work holiday party!","It was perfect for both.","I will say the dress is short, but I think you can see in all of the photos.","The lace is very pretty and the color definitely stands out!","I would recommend this dress!"
"party","The top does run small so Im glad I went up a size for my backup.","Its a gorgeous and thick material-very well made!","My husband literally stopped mid sentence when he first saw me in this dress and asked if I could keep it :) The detailing is beautiful on the skirt.","I was able to wear it to two different events.","The first event I paired it with nude colored heels and jewelry, the second night I wore a gold statement necklace and black peep toe pumps-both looked great!","(sorry, the pictures I took were to large to load onto the site) Loved, loved, loved this dress!","!"
"party","I got a medium.","Sleeve length was fine for my l9ng arms.","Easy way to add a little color to your outfit.","It is very warm."
"party","The dress runs about 1 size large because it stretches (it is wet-suit/scuba material).","I am usually a 6, sometimes an 8 due to being a DD, but I wore a 4.","It is VERY comfortable and flattering.","It had pockets which is awesome.","Both the 4 and the 6 that I received were almost a pale grey rather than white, but this could be due to over-wear.","Im 5 foot even, wore about 2-3 inch heels and it hit around knee length for me."
"party","Huge pockets were a bonus!","Wouldnt have even needed a clutch.","Loved the fitted bodice and the loose skirt - this dress would definitely disguise a post-baby belly.","Felt sexy and fun and got a ton of compliments!"
"party","I rented this dress for a work holiday party.","Lots of compliments and definitely stood out from all the black and red holiday dresses.","The cut is edgy, but I still felt classy.","I wore sliver sparkly heels and bracelets.","Im sad I didnt get a photo of the dress on.","I really wanted to keep this one!"
"party","This dress ran true to size and was very flattering on my athletic figure.","Id definitely recommend wearing spanx because the fabric is rather clingy.","The long was a little too short, but I was wearing some tall (about 4.5) heels.","This was a great dress and I didnt stop receiving glowing compliments all night!","Id definitely rent this one again...and have in another color!"
"party","This jumpsuit is very forgiving, stretchy fabric, (not cheap looking), well tailored.","The embellished neck was the perfect accessory.","I wore it with the mid chest closure, so not as much cleavage, still VERY SEXY!!!","not raunchy (I am a bit busty).","I am 52 the R fit perfectly with 4inch heels (could wear shorter heels and still be OK.","I will definitely rent this again.","I received so many compliments"
"party","fitted style with Parkers fabulous tailoring and built in shape wear.","Not my usual NYC style, but was perfect for a fancy rehearsal dinner in beverly hills.","Went up to a size large for fuller bust and more coverage."
"party","Fits great!","I ordered this as my back up and ended up wearing it for NYE instead of the dress I originally ordered.","Its more champagne pink than the picture appears.","It is the perfect amount of v-neck where I didnt need Hollywood tape or a special bra.","Only potential problem was that its a little tight in the armpit area.","Super comfortable for a long night of dinner (you can actually eat a meal in this dress and not need spanx) & dancing.","LOVED this dress!","Highly recommended!"
"party","I rented this dress for my baby shower.","I am 9 months pregnant and this dress fit me perfectly!","granted it was super tight on my belly but it fit well everywhere else.","Im 57 so I was assuming that with my giant belly taking up so much fabric the dress would be too short but it still touched the floor.","The slit up the side is very modest and wasnt too revealing for a pregnant lady.","Im small chested and could see this this dress being an issue for anyone with a large bust.","Im typically a size 6-8 in maternity (8 is for length) I wore the size 10L and it fit better than most maternity dresses fit."
"party","This dress looks even better in person.","It fits true to size and is perfect for a cocktail party type of event.","I got compliments all night and people constantly asked me where I got my dress from."
"vacation","Wore this dress to a show in Vegas... it is made for Vegas with all the sequences, so shiny.","Received many compliments.","It is a low V in the front."
"vacation","I signed up for rtr unlimited ...","I had this leather jacket in my queue and I got it in July.","Luckily I was heading on vacation where it was the perfect temp to wear this light leather jacket.","The leather is SO soft and this jacket is beautiful!"
"vacation","I dont like clothes that are tight fitting so I thought it fit great (not too tight and not too loose).","The top was a little big but I just used sticky tape to keep it in place!"
"vacation","I rented this to take on a weekend vacation for a date night, and it was perfect!","It was so comfortable and the fit was great.","It seemed to run big, so I got a size smaller, and it was perfect.","I loved the pattern!"
"vacation","A little loose, generous fit.","You could size down!"
"vacation","loved it.","great for cocktails or causal."
"vacation","Very sung fit but with size medium it was perfect :)"
"vacation","The fit was perfect and the length was just right.","im 58 and it was perfect!","No complaints about this dress at all!","!"
"vacation","I love shift dresses, and this one was beautiful!!!","The fabric was perfect and it could be dressed up or down with flats or heels !","I wore this dress for a night out on the town in Miami, FL and it was perfect!","I would highly recommend this dress and I wish I could buy it!","Another RTR success!!","!"
"vacation","Im usually a 4 in dresses and the small fits perfectly.","The dress has a bit of weight to it and the yellow color is nice and bright.","The lacing is very detailed but wont snag easily.","The drop shoulders kept riding up though when I sat down to eat.","Thankfully I had a black cape sweater on so I didnt have to keep pulling the shoulders down.","This is the first time I wore this type of dress so Im not sure if its common for the shoulders to ride up or I just need to size up.","Maybe Ill try the medium next time!"
"vacation","I wore this while in Vegas on a friendversary trip with my best friend.","I freaking LOVED this dress.","The only thing I wasnt super crazy about was that it felt like the sleeve was trying to slip off my shoulder.","Not a big deal.","There isnt much stretch in the dress at all.","And its pretty short if youre on the tall side.","If you dont want to overexpose yourself just get a pair of boyshorts or Spanx to wear underneath."
"vacation","Wore this on a trip to Vegas and it was comfortable and sexy without having to let it all hangout.","I wore a regular bra with thin straps.","It was very comfortable and lightweight.","I would rent again.","It is very long.","Im 59 and it hit my ankles so would not recommend for shorter people unless you wear with tall heels."
"vacation","I have wide hips so this dress makes me look a little wider than I would like.","Regardless the top is flattering that I felt confident wearing it.","This would be perfect for a spring or summer wedding."
"vacation","I wore this top for  a night out in Las Vegas on a company trip.","The fabric is amazing.","I couldnt get enough of the collar, it was perfect.","I am normally a small in tops and this fit perfectly."
"vacation","despite it running large in the top and legs the waist is tight.","I loved it!!","it was So comfortable!"
"vacation","This top was perfect for our vacation to Mexico.","It was light and breathable in the heat.","The only con is that the middle button in the breast area came undone a couple of times when I was carrying my baby or shopping bags.","Other than that, its a comfy, very cute top!"
"vacation","it was a very ight and airy fit which was perfect for the weather"
"vacation","So cute!","It is smaller in the bust, so if you are larger, then this isnt a good choice for you.","I was nervous about it since Im petit, but looks great.","Cant wait to wear it!"
"vacation","I love this jacket.","The leather is soft and the pockets have fleece inside which feels great on a cold night.","I rented a Medium but would probably size up to a large so I could wear a bulkier sweater underneath.","The one drawback is that when zipped up the waist was tight on me, its sort of a triangle silhouette, which is flattering but impractical depending on your weight and outfit.","Wearing the jacket out I honestly felt I got better service than I normally would - either this jacket says treat me well or I was acting more confident in it.","I was trying it out to see if Id actually wear a black leather jacket and the answer is YES!"
"vacation","im typically btwn a 2 and a 4, but always a 2 in rebecca taylor.","this was extremely unflattering on me.","i didnt find the neck to the tight.","it was just massive.","even if i got the 0 i think it wldnt have worked.","ive worn other dresses in this tent-ish style and never had a problem, but this did not work for me.","it made me look short and very pregnant.","it is ok with a belt, but that isnt the look im going over."
"vacation","This was just as adorable in person as pictures!","I wore it on my wedding anniversary dinner date during vacation and received many compliments.","It fit true to size, very comfortable, wasnt tight or too short either (I am 52, usually wear a size small / size 2-4).","I would wear it again in a heart beat!","!"
"vacation","Fabulous dress, fit and detailing.","It is fully lined."
"vacation","Rented for Mexico but totally did not fit, runs really small .if the neckline was adjustable that would have helped."
"vacation","Rented the dress for a beach vacation and wore it a lot.","Perfect for hot summer days, can be a beach dress - or an evening dress, depending on how you style it.","Great quality and fabric.","Not too long- Im 54 and could wear it with flats easily."
"vacation","Fit well.","A little tight in the shoulders, if anything.","Its a little see-through so not a great bathing suit cover up (you could see my gold and black patterned bandeau through the top)."
"vacation","medium was great, could fit over sweaters without looking too bulky.","So comfy and surprisingly warm.","Will definitely rent again!"
"vacation","This dress is perfect for a cruise.","Its formal but comfortable.","It worked perfectly for a dinner with my husband.","Its really long so make sure you have heels (I am 58 and it was still long on me).","Got lots of compliments from my fellow cruisers and felt great in the dress."
"vacation","True to size, pretty color"
"vacation","This dress doesnt mess around.","It looks sexy and has that, I am a strong woman!","look.","Bold and beautiful and classy all at the same time.","I didnt end up wearing it though, because another dress I recieved was the better choice for the look I was going for."
"vacation","I love the way the romper looked.","It was perfect for going to a Britney Spears concert in Las Vegas.","I got lots of compliments.","However, I wouldnt wear it again because it made me too nervous that I might have a wardrobe malfunction--I kept having to check that everything was in place.","Double sided tape is a must but even then, its very little material to cover the girls.","Im pear-shaped and it was hard to squeeze it over my hips too."
"vacation","Fit as expected in the waist but a little large in the top.","Its a unique, large and bright floral pattern  - perfect for renting b/c its very in now but its a pretty loud print that Im not sure will still be in next season."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a vegas weekend and I loved it.","It fit perfectly and is stretchy enough to broaden the size range.","I got tons of compliments on this dress"
"vacation","The dress was adorable, and I got lots of compliments.","The fabric has a bit of stretch, so I wore a size smaller than normal.","Besides a super sticky zipper that almost caused me not to be able to wear it, and a bit of itch under arms, it was awesome!"
"vacation","When the coat I really wanted for my trip to Paris wasnt available, I settled on this one as all the reviews raved about its warmth.","They werent lying!","I used it on an almost month long trip in London and Paris in the dead of winter and it kept me warm and cozy the entire trip.","It was a great choice and the leather details give it some restrained but well proportioned style."
"vacation","Great dress for all seasons - in summer w sandals , in cooler weather w a wrap and heels .","The halter meck is so flaytering, my arms/shoulders arent the most toned but youd never know it the way this was cut .","The beading is exauisite but doesnt overdress it - just a fabulous high quality dress!"
"vacation","Loved this jumpsuit but the fit wasnt ideal.","The zipper doesnt go all the way down in the back and there is no stretch, so while I couldve fit the small I couldnt pull it up over my hips/backside.","The medium ran a bit big in the torso and the straps sometimes fell down from my shoulders.","I had to wear a belt for it not to look too big.","However, it is a really cute jumpsuit, and I got a lot of compliments."
"vacation","This is a total head turner.","Shows off legs.","Flattering fit.","Looks great w a little straw hat and black platforms.","Wore to the pool in Vegas.","So cute."
"vacation","Great dress for a beach party.","Runs VERY large.","Im a pretty solid size 10 & this was huge.","I could easily have worn an 8 maybe even a 6.","And missing the belt."
"vacation","Just perfect...really hard to let go!"
"vacation","I wore the 8 though it was a bit snug in places, it fit better than the 10.","I loved this dress.","The fit was great, very flattering and received loads of compliments from strangers.","I would purchase this dress to dress up or down!"
"vacation","This top is a showstopper and voluminous!","This style is right on trend with an off the shoulder cut and statement ruffles.","However, I would suggest sizing down due to the sleeves were loose and the volume of  the ruffles can be a little overwhelming."
"vacation","Fit true to size.","Hug my mini curves nicely."
"vacation","Fit great, very comfortable and casual"
"vacation","I wore this dress one night during my birthday trip to Paris.","Its a lot simpler that what Id normally go for but I wanted something simple to showcase a statement necklace and this was perfect.","Id definitely recommend wearing bold accessories and really glamming up the hair and makeup as well as wearing tall heels as I think it would look way too plain and boring without eye catching accessories.","The fit was a little strange, seemed very loose in the bottom half but maybe its supposed to be that way.","The arms and shoulders were tight but the 0 which is my true size still worked out.","There are zippers on the sleeves which I didnt need to use at all.","The beginning of the zipper was itchy and poked my skin on one arm throughout the night.","I would have preferred no zippers on the sleeves at all.","Other than that though, fun dress for a night but not my favorite ever."
"vacation","The way the sequenced fabric flowed was elegant.","It fit almost flawlessly, the dress molded my torso beautifully, complimenting my shape.","I had so many compliments."
"vacation","I have trouble with jumpsuits fitting well some times, but this was no problem.","It was comfortable, sleek, and sophisticated.","I would definitely recommend it."
"vacation","I brought this dress on a warm weather vacation and ended up wearing it multiple times.","I love it.","The back is sexy and interesting, and the dress is lightweight enough for warm weather, but substantial enough to feel put together.","I could think of endless events to wear this, from a casual even with a jean jacket thrown on top to a wedding with more formal jewelry."
"vacation","Rented this for a trip I took, but did not have a chance to wear it.","I did try it on before I left town and it fit great.","Will rent it again another time."
"vacation","I loved the color - much softer looking than a traditional leather jacket.","The back detail was adorable.","It was comfortable and warm.","I would rent this again!"
"vacation","Loved the fit - wore the XS vs. the S I thought Id wear.","I have larger hips for my height/chest size but it still fit fine.","Didnt stretch out like other reviews stated, but I wasnt moving around a whole lot.","I wore stick petals vs. a real or strapless bra and that worked well for my small chest.","Im 53 and it was mid-thigh.","I loved it and got a TON of compliments!"
"vacation","The weight of the dress and the lining are very nice!","It is a fun, figure fitting dress in a quality stretchy fabric that was very comfortable to wear!","With the detail of the dress, I opted for nude shoes, big earrings and a clutch to match."
"vacation","It was very short in the torso on me.","I kept getting a wedgie...but the piece is super cute so I wore it anyway!","It didnt come with a belt so I used my own.","I wish it came in a long and it would have been perfect.","I could have worn a size 0 but I figured the 2 might be a little longer.","Still wasnt long enough, probably should have just gone with the 0 as the 2 was just a little big in the waist."
"vacation","Very short.","I am 53 and I wouldnt have been able to wear heels.","I am pretty small chested and if I took a big breath or stretched my arms, the button closure would pop.","Adjustable straps helped.","I felt cute and flirty in it.","I would def rent again for vacation, day party, baby shower etc."
"vacation","I rented this for a weekend trip to Traverse City.","It was snowy there, so this was the perfect layering sweater.","I wore it with a cute gray tee underneath, and then I wore it again with a flannel underneath.","Its the perfect sweater to keep you warm in the cold winter months!","My boyfriend loved it!","I will definitely rent again."
"vacation","The chest area was UNFORGIVING.","Im a 38D and they only way I got it on was by zipping it up around my waist and then stuffing my boobs into it ( a trick i learned from the reviews, thanks girls).","It was tight, and I felt that if I moved too quickly I might tear the damn thing but in the end totally worth it because the dress is gorgeous.","Just wish they would make clothes with bustier girls in mind."
"vacation","I rented this for vacation in Charleston, SC.","I had my eye on this dress for a while and was really happy with the rental.","I would have prefered a size 0 but only the 2R was available.","It was larger than I would have prefered, but would definitely rent the 0R again.","Im 53 and wore this with flats, didnt think the length was awkward at all.","Paired with a big sun hat I loved strolling the streets of low country in the dress.","I recommend it!"
"vacation","I found the medium didnt fit in the waist as it was too tight so I had to size up to Large which made the top too large.","The lower shoulder was way too low to be appropriate so I had to keep pulling it up.","It wasnt a quality issue and the romper was well made.","Just not for someone whos 51."
"vacation","This dress fit perfect!","The inside is a supersoft material that was a little stretchy.","I might have been able to go down to an 8.","I was comfortable all night in this dress, if I had a reason to dress like this more often I would buy it!","It was not short at all.","If someone was shorter than me the length might be too long for them."
"vacation","I thought this was black when I ordered it, its definitely more of a brown or brown black.","The rise is also short; I didnt really have enough fabric above the waist to create a blousy effect like on the model (it would have involved giving myself a wedgie!)","Overall a success!"
"vacation","I will definitely rent this again for another occasion , it was SO sexy and flattering!"
"vacation","Very flowy and light.","Loved the color.","Fit was perfect and elastic waste made the dress comfortable after a dinner out.","Only issue was one of the sleeves kept flipping over to show the line color underneath.","No big deal but did not match the other sleeve."
"vacation","Beautiful dress- will require a low back and adjustable strap bra for the perfect fit!"
"vacation","I am usually hesitant to try maxi dresses because I am 411, not to mention a little busty for my short frame (32D) but with the slight high/low detail I was able to rock this dress.","The small was almost a little too snug in the bust but the medium was wayyy too loose so I stuck to the small.","The length ended up being perfect for me."
"vacation","I rented this dress for our Estes Park, Stanley Hotel Anniversary getaway.","After reading the reviews I was a bit nervous as I usually wear a 10 but so many women went up 1 and even 2 sizes on this dress.","The only size they had was the 12 so I rented that.","It was pretty snug and walking up the stairs was interesting but the material is pretty heavy which holds everything in nicely.","I received compliments literally within minutes of stepping out of our room and continued to get them all night.","This is a classy but super sexy little dress and I would rent it again in a second."
"vacation","Super smooth silky material.","Nice back.","Loved the breathablility."
"vacation","Rented this for summer vacation.","I ordered the large and felt it was very baggy and needed to be accessorized with a belt.","The light fabric was perfect for a hot summer day though!"
"vacation","My friends and I rented dresses at the store in the Cosmopolitan out in Vegas.","At first I thought I wanted to wear sequins, but when I tried this one on, there was no contest.","You never think a dress so tight could be so comfortable!","Im a fan of Herve leger for life now.","The fabric and cut of this dress is extremely flattering to curvy figures.","Also, a HUGE plus for me was that at a 34DDD I didnt have to wear a bra!!!","Im not saying I was 100% covered up, but I definitely felt supported.","And Im pretty sure the many people who commented on my dress (men and women) thought so too..."
"vacation","I rented this dress for vacation on the Cape and it was exactly what I wanted.","As a few other reviews mentioned this size 2 had a broken zipper and it was extremely difficult to zipper it.","However, once I got it on, I loved it.","As with most Kate Spade dresses, the size 2 was slightly tight in the chest area but not uncomfortable.","This dress is also forgiving in the stomach since it flairs out a bit.","Besides the zipper issue, I really enjoyed this dress."
"vacation","I brought this with me for my trip to the beach.","Wore it all day, and then transitioned it into night by adding makeup and accessories.","Very comfortable, very cute.","As other reviews say, the top is a little tight if you have boobs, but I just left one button undone and wore a cute black lace bralette.","Was a little disappointed it didnt come with the waist tie."
"vacation","As other reviews stated, this runs a little big so I was really comfortable in the 8, although I have been wearing mostly size 10 lately.","This was very feminine and flattering.","I wore it with flip flops on vacation with my family and with heels on a night out with my husband and some friends.","The color looked great with my summer tan- probably couldnt pull off the pale pink when my skin is paler.","The cons (which were definitely outweighed by the pros) were that it was a bit difficult to snap in the back on my own and wrinkled easily when sitting."
"vacation","Wore to a concert in Vegas.","Perfect combination of trendy and comfy.","It does run small but good thing I ordered an extra size up."
"vacation","Modest but pretty, pretty cut.","Runs a little bigger around the waist, so you may want to consider getting the size down as a back-up, depending on how fitted youd like to wear this.","Appropriate V-neck and length for a conservative office environment as well.","Highly recommend!"
"vacation","I rented this as one of the dresses for two formal nights on my cruise last week.","I absolutely love this dress!","I could hear compliments all night as I walked by other cruisers to and from dinner.","The V in front is VERY deep, and I had to wear a normal bra as my breast lift patches werent working.","You could see the bra, but I used fashion tap to try to minimize the appearance.","My husband did have to help me into it, especially with the top zipper in back, and we also tapped the dress to the bra in back.","The color was stunning, and the pockets!!","Perfect for not having to carry a purse to hold my phone and cruise card.","Im 54, and wore a 14 and it was perfect.","The cut out back is a fun little detail as well.","I wore 3-4 heels and the length was perfect.","And because my backups didnt arrive in time due to shipping issues, I ended up wearing this on the second formal night as well.","Definitely would rent this again!"
"vacation","I absolutely loved this dress!","fit me perfectly!","very cute and fun!","I would totally consider buying this."
"vacation","Sexy, shows off your legs!"
"vacation","I wore this dress to Vegas, absolutely gorgeous.","Perfect size.","Im normally a medium, or sometimes even a large, but the small fit absolutely perfect."
"vacation","I absolutely loved this dress.","It was so flattering on, and I received so many compliments.","I am already hoping I have a reason to rent it again."
"vacation","Im a little too short for the torso of this one piece, but I still wore it for a brunch date and got compliments!","Its very comfortable, light-weight and not at all sheer because of the liner.","I could have considered buying this one if I were over 53 and it fit me!","Easy to dress up or dress down - definitely worth the rent for your vacation or just to have a weekend option in your closet!"
"vacation","This dress isnt made of Clover Canyons usual material - this is more of a jersey material.","But the dress fits well and the pattern is fun.","The cutout is just enough.","Its definitely long.","I am only 52 , but with the regular length I needed 5 heels for the dress not to drag."
"vacation","Moves really well, photographs well.","All that is at the waist is a string tie, which I used but if you want something more substantial you might have to add a belt.","Length was fine with heels because it was supposed to be flowy and fun, might have been too long with flats."
"vacation","Loved this dress a lot unfortunately it did not arrive before i left for my vacation.","Its a little short for my office so I had to send it back but I look forward to renting it again for the right occasion.","Maybe a shower or luncheon or brunch or graduation."
"vacation","Ive worn other sequence dresses but this one was unlike the others, comfortable around the underarm area.","usually the sequences rub against my skin and hurt at the end of the night but not these.","the color is very flattering like a golden pinkish, wore it with golden/glittery/crystal stilettos, a gold bangle and gold hoops, no necklace.","looks great on pictures and is a head turner for sure.","My husband said it is a very pretty dress and that I looked elegant.","So if your thing is to show your curves, this is not the dress."
"vacation","This dress is true to fit.","Based on photos, I thought it was a true fit & flare style dress but there is a ruffle at the hem of the dress that gives the dress more curve to your shape.","The halter shape was a bit big on me -- might be better for a larger bust -- but was fine with some fashion tape.","Overall, loved the dress!"
"vacation","At first I was worried the dress wouldnt zip so I called RTR for help.","They were great!","Since I was in Vegas they offered to exchange the dress at their Cosmopolitan store.","Luckily with a little tug.","the dress was a perfect fit.","Hig hugging and very slimming.","Another success from RTR!"
"vacation","I cant get enough of Herve Leger!","The small fit great!","Its a very fitted dress but still comfortable.","Definitely order a larger backup size just in case."
"vacation","I loved this pattern, but unfortunately wasnt able to wear.","There is a belt sewn in at the waist that I wasnt able to secure.","It also was very low cut.","Length would have been good (about 2in above my knee).","Would order up next time.","A shame, since its so cute!"
"vacation","The photos on here dont do this dress justice - the only reason I rented it is because I saw it in Cusp and it is stunning in person.","It ran very small, so I would suggest sizing up.","The fabric is really thick so dont rent it for a hot day.","And its either no bra or sticky bra."
"vacation","I read reviews Bc initially I wouldnt have thought I was a small, but in the end, the small was perfect.","Dresses were in great condition, and return instructions were very easy to understand!!","I wore this with a nubra, which worked great for the lace back!"
"vacation","Fit accommodated my bust without looking squished (34D)."
"vacation","Wore with a standard strapless bra.","If I rent again, I will go down one size.","The straps were a little bit long, and so my hubby tied little knots at the top of the straps to shorten them.","Luckily my hair hid the knots.","This shirt can be dressed up or down, and I felt really great in it.","I wore it over 4th of July weekend, and the red, white and blue colors were great....but, Id wear it anytime."
"vacation","I am short, but I felt tall and glamorous in this dress.","I did wear nearly 4 platform sandals and it hit the floor, so dont expect to wear this with flats unless you are nearly 58!","I have a narrow shoulders, a large bust, small waist and large hips, and find long dresses hard to fit--but this worked so well.","I got a lot of compliments!"
"vacation","I am a six weeks post partum gal with 34-F bra size due to breast feeding.","I know my current body is temporary and needed a bright dress for my family vacation photos.","This dress was very forgiving on my body and managed to fit my large breast size perfectly.","It is very orange and the color was originally a smidge off putting, but boy does it photograph well!","Highly recommend for larger cup sized ladies."
"vacation","I rented at his for work because in the photo it looked like a crisp cut and fabric.","It was softer in fabric and cut than expected and not formal enough for my office so I wore it on vacation and for plane travel.","Very comfortable, classic cut fits comfortably and feels soft.","Fit is true to size and fairly generous."
"vacation","I rented this to wear for New Years Eve at the beachy resort in Florida.","The color is beautiful, I would call it persimmon -- it is a tad more orange than in the photo.","The fit was amazing for my shape.","The v in the front was the perfect depth, not too conservative but definitely not too low.","The fitted waste with the slightly flared skirt was extremely flattering.","The length was a tab longer on me than the model, I would say an inch above my knee.","I received compliments all night and would absolutely rent again."
"vacation","This sweater was a little bigger than I expected and I could have probably gotten away with a Medium.","I wore this on the first day of my trip to San Francisco from the plane, to walking around the city.","It was about 55 degrees and I wasnt hot at all.","It was the perfect weight without having to wear a jacket.","My only complaint is that it was already somewhat bigger than expected and then stretched a little.","Certainly comfortable, but I dont think I will rent it again."
"vacation","Dress seemed to be true to size, but due to the cut/style of it, I am unable to wear it.","It is a little boxy and has too much room in the chest and not enough room in the hips.","This would be cute for someone with less hips than myself."
"vacation","This dress was so cute for a day spent on Bourbon Street and at the parades.","I liked how low cut it was.","It was very fitted until the waist and I didnt even need to wear a bra.","It hit right at my waist and flared from there, and it was very flattering and slimming.","It also wasnt too short - it hit right above the knee.","This can be dressed up to be really fancy or dressed down to be more of a fun/party dress.","I usually am between a 2 and a 4 and went with the 2.","I would describe the color as a rose gold.","I would SO rent this again!"
"vacation","Absolutely loved this dress!","The blue is even more vibrant in person, and it s on a heather grey background which is a little hard to tell in the pictures.","I also rented the suggested necklace, and while I was a little skeptical when I saw the necklace separate from the dress, it worked beautifully together.","I wore this for a night out in Vegas in April, and I was a little nervous it would be too warm based on other reviews, but it was perfect."
"vacation","This dress was extremely comfortable and flattering.","The belt really gives it a shape.","I would absolutely rent this again."
"vacation","Fi perfectly.","True to size."
"vacation","This was an easy breezy outfit for vacation.","I wore it with converse and it looked pulled together yet comfy.","The material is thick, but not overly so.","The top fit me a bit large and I think it could have been tailored a bit on the shoulders, but otherwise it was a good choice."
"vacation","First off I am 40 and not a stick so micro mini is NOT my thing.","I wore this on vacation and it was perfect, good dinner out dress.","Comfortable too!"
"vacation","I had to wear it with a strapless bra"
"vacation","Comfortable, fun dress!","I thought it would be warmer in Miami when I ordered it on my birthday discount but it was chilly so I tried it on and took the picture with my mimosa and sadly sent it back.","Would order again again for the right occasion."
"vacation","I rented this to have nice photos taken on vacation and didnt want to take it off!","The regular length was a bit long but I wasnt wearing shoes.","Truly more beautiful in person than in the pics online.","Very elegant and fun to wear!"
"vacation","This dress was FANTASTIC for our Vegas ladies trip.","The color is so vibrant and the pattern and texture of the dress are also very eye catching.","The dress is pretty short and Ive got a booty on me, so I definitely had to be careful on the dance floor.","IT was freezing in Vegas while we were there, so I ended up pairing with black tights.","I added some gold accessories and a red lip.","This dress is VERY thick, so while it smooths any lumps or bumps you want to hide, I wouldnt recommend this dress for warm weather."
"vacation","Wore this to go wine tasting.","The MR was a little big, but when I go smaller in pants I sometimes run in to length being too short.","The length was perfect.","I am 5 7.5.","The back slits open so I wore bandeau underneath to be able to wear strappless bra.","Material was very light weight so had to wear cardigan with it for warmth."
"vacation","I am 52/ XS, and I ordered according to the sizing chart, and the dress was huge on me!!","Even with platforms there was a few inches of fabric pooling around the bottom, and the top was not fitted at all.","However, it is a gorgeous dress that can be dressed up or down, so if you rent it I would suggest going a size or 2 down and Im sure it would look fabulous:)"
"vacation","Very flattering and feminine dress, especially the lace up back.","Wore it on vacation in the Dominican Republic and received a lot of compliments from men.","Its sexy, but not revealing (no cleavage, not a lot of leg showing)."
"vacation","The shoulder straps slip."
"vacation","First jumpsuit Ive tried because of my height.","This was perfect.","Im 510 and rolled the legs slightly for a different look."
"vacation","Length was great, thin crepe silk dress."
"vacation","I loved wearing this nice light dress during my recent Hawaii vacation.","It was airy and comfortable.","The bohemian print was perfect for going out to dinner and then coming back to our place and having a casual night hanging with  friends."
"vacation","Love this silky, breezy dress.","Wore it on a trip to Napa Valley with friends.","You could wear it with sandals or booties and it would pair well with tights and a long sweater for Fall.","Its very flowy, so if youre looking for something fitted, plan on wearing a belt."
"vacation","Great jacket to dress up jeans or dress down a long sleeveless dress in the spring/fall.","Very versatile."
"vacation","Loved the pockets and loops over the shoulder to help hold back bra straps.","Dress ran true to size and fit perfectly.","Easy to dress up or down.","Versatile piece.","Fun to accessorize because of all the great colors in the dress...you could go so many directions with it!"
"vacation","This was a perfect fit and so comfortable.","It was perfect for my beach vacation to Cabo."
"vacation","I wore this in Montauk for a day look.","I read reviews about it being a little see through but with the right underwear it was fine.","Im 58 and was a little worried when playing corn hole because it was so short.","But I was still comfortable and would rent again."
"vacation","I wore this while on vacation with a friend.","We had a nice dinner, visited an art gallery and then bar hopped... this jumpsuit turned heads in every venue.","Such a great sexy look.","I will definitely rent this again... if I dont end up buying it first!"
"vacation","Great bright, vivid color.","It runs a bit large as I usually wear a 2 and the 0 was still big in the waist.","I added a belt to help define it, but some pictures I took from the side werent very flattering because of this."
"vacation","I typically wear a size 8, and so after reading some reviews decided on the 12 and it was a great fit.","This dress is so fun and different, a perfect pick for vacation where I want to feel little extra special.","The off-the-shoulder sleeves (cap sleeves?)","were comfortable, and there is a small elastic included so that they stay on your shoulders properly."
"vacation","Love this top.","Will pair it with some white pants."
"vacation","I received so many compliments in this!","It runs super big and the sleeves are still a bit short but thats what made it work with so much in my closet.","I paired it with a turtleneck, a plain white tee, and a yellow long sleeve - all looked great with it."
"vacation","I rented this dress but ended up sharing it with my BFF (who had rented another HL dress from RTR, we swapped the second night!)","and we both looked awesome in it.","See my body type/measurements above, Im not exactly bombshell material, but this dress did help me look more sexy and less straight up and down.","My BFF really looked amazing in this dress; shes 52, size 0, 34C, and has a booty.","This dress made her itty bitty waist look like nothing, and she truly looked bombshell in it!","Men and women would not stop complimenting her!","It wasnt too long on her either, but it wasnt too short on me.","Would absolutely recommend this dress"
"vacation","54 fit perfectly other then in the shoulders- the straps fell down a lot."
"vacation","This dress was pretty blah.","It had nothing particularly special about it and decided to send it back.","Wasnt impressed."
"vacation","Fit well, comfortable."
"vacation","I am having so much fun with the unlimited plan.","I had to go to a screening and wanted a fun top.","I popped into the store near me and I saw this in the dressing room.","I do not normally wear this pattern but I loved the design so I figured I would try it on.","So glad I did!","I am a 36D so it was a bit tight on the boobs but honestly it was fine.","Felt like a corset.","It was much sexier on then you would think.","Would rent it and wear again!","Boyfriend liked it too!"
"vacation","This dress was perfect for dinner on vacation.","It fit in all the right places.","I have a small bust and a very athletic build and it fit perfectly.","The colors of the dress are perfect!","I received compliments all night.","I wish I owned this dress."
"vacation","I wore this on a vacation in Mexico.","The romper fabric feels very nice, and the fit if flowy and comfy.","Not the most exciting piece of clothing, but stylish enough and the deep V gives it a little something."
"vacation","This dress runs small but it fit like a GLOVE, i.e.","no bra necessary.","The cut out back was my favorite along with the neck line.","BF complimented me all night long.","Definitely renting again!"
"vacation","im typically a 4 and joie usually runs very large.","i usually get an XS but opted for the S just in case and it worked out perfectly!","it was easy, casual, looked great with brown booties and with flat sandals.","also very easy to get out of for a jumpsuit.","i had to wear a sports bra under, but it didnt take away from the overall look.","hem hit mid thigh on me, but wasnt scandalous"
"vacation","fits like a glove"
"vacation","I rented this dress for a bachelorette night in Las Vegas and received great compliments.","I wore the small over the medium even though it was slightly shorter than I was comfortable with accentuated my body best.","As others have mentioned, the dress is a bit tight in the ribs and it was difficult for me to raise my arms high.","None of that prevented me from feeling sexy, strutting, and dancing though!"
"vacation","Dress was perfect for a weekend in Vegas.","It is heavy, so it can be warm, but it was very comfortable.","The material is thick, which helps make it very forgiving!"
"vacation","I normally wear a 6 or an 8 in other dresses and the 6 was a bit too big.","I would have worn the 4 except it was VERY short and since I was hosting a bridal shower and would be moving around a lot/moving presents, I didnt feel comfortable wearing something that short.","It was super comfortable, and I was complimented by everyone at the shower.","The pockets were great to stash my phone in them and being able to snap photos throughout the event, without having to physically hold my phone all afternoon.","I had the dress on for 6+ hours, and could have worn it for another 6 hours!","I paired the dress with a pair of sparkly silver heels."
"vacation","Wore this in Vegas on my bachelorette trip!","Was perfect for a girly night out (Thunder Down Under & dinner!).","Was very comfortable.","The darker shade of gold is really complementary to skin tones.","The dress is way less tulip-y in person FYI but very pretty!"
"vacation","LOVE every dress Ive rented from Mara Hoffman!","Her prints are magic and her dresses always fit me even though Im short-waisted and short in general.","I loved that this one wasnt too sheer and could be dressed up or down.","I wore it in Hawaii with flip flops but it would look great with wedges or a casual heel.","This one runs pretty big.","I got the small but probably could have gone with the XS."
"vacation","I liked this dress and appreciated that it came in petite.","I am 53 and was able to wear this with flat sandals.","I am usually on the fence between a small and medium (4/6 dress size), but the small fit well.","Fun dress for vacation."
"vacation","I loved this dress but there are some things you should know when choosing a size.","This dress runs small so you may want to size up.","If you are 115 lbs or more, I would recommend a size Small or larger (depending on your body type).","I am a pretty small person and the X-Small was too tight for me.","That size is meant for a very petite body type.","The waist band on this dress is very small/tight and does not have stretch to it so keep this in mind.","The other reviews regarding the slit are spot on - it is VERY high.","You will need fashion tape or safety pins to keep the top closed (and not show the goods).","I used a couple safety pins.","This dress is so cute and I received many compliments.","Just know you need to be careful with the size you choose."
"vacation","I rented this dress for vacation at the beach.","This dress is as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures.","However, I wrote that it ran true to size, and, for the most part, it does, but it was a little loose in the waist.","For that reason, it wasnt as flattering as it could have been.","Other than that, I loved the length (I am 58 and wore the regular length with flats--I probably could have even worn a small heel).","The crocheted top is great for adding a little texture.","The dress is very well made and I felt great wearing it.","Would definitely recommend!"
"vacation","It was a bit of a struggle to get in and out of this dress - but totally comfortable on.","A pretty snug fit, so it rides up a little bit when you walk - but overall a fun and sexy option for a night out."
"vacation","I rented this dress for my Bachelorette/Caribbean vacation.","I loved it!","I felt trendy and sexy.","My girlfriends loved it and I got a lot of compliments.","The detail around the neckline is gorgeous."
"vacation","The dress was longer than I expected but I was still able to wear it with flats.","I loved the way the dress fell and the thickness of the material."
"vacation","I received this from a stylist since the dress i originally ordered came back damaged.","i didnt end up wearing this because we were in miami for a bachelorette party, and this dress was a little classier/dinnier(totes just made that word up) than the occasion called for.","regardless its a gorgeous dress.","would be perfect for a wedding, dinner, or charity event!"
"vacation","Great flowy summer dress for vacation.","I packed it and wore it while I was away and it traveled well.","So much fun to dance in and hits the right balance between fun and casual, but also can be dressed up.","The neck is pretty high, no necklace needed and the waist has an embellished detail, so I only wore it with earrings"
"vacation","Perfect length for me, but this could be short on people of average height.","Otherwise fits true to size.","Order long if you are taller than 53 or want to wear heels"
"vacation","It was very comfortable"
"vacation","Wore it in Vegas.","Super Cute but you do have to unzip the jumpsuit every time you have to pee, which got annoying by the end of the night.","Its different than the typical short dress outfit for Vegas, yet it was sexy and fun to wear."
"vacation","Great Fit!","Very comfortable , can we worn with flats or heels.","Loved this romper.","Renting again !"
"vacation","I rented the dress for a destination wedding but ultimately decided to wear another dress that felt more formal.","It was so fun so I wore this to the rehearsal dinner instead and loved it!","The cutout was a really fun touch, and much less noticeable than it appears on the model.","I usually wear a 0 or 2, so I took a chance on the 2 since the 0 wasnt available."
"vacation","Snagged this maxi originally for tropical vacation and kept it for a few other wears.","Nice, flattering fit and the fabric pattern is bright and cheerful without being garish.","Despite the R-regular length, this maxi is extremely long even when worn with large wedges.","This style should compliment any array of body types."
"vacation","This runs a bit small through the body.","If youre tall (Im 5 9), the length might be a bit too short.","Additionally, if you have a large(r) rear, it might not fit all that well!","I would have ordered a size up, if I had known."
"vacation","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.","Will rent it again!!","I received compliments all night!"
"vacation","This dress was  a replacement for TWO that I had mailed to me for my upcoming trip to Las Vegas.","Both dresses looked terrible on me, so I visited the store in Las Vegas to swap them out.","Upon trying this dress on, I knew it was PERFECT.","I was really surprised when I saw the photos of the dress  on the website.","This dress is far more flattering and beautiful in person.","I am usually a size 16, but  the 14W was perfect.","The photos make the dress look boxy, but it perfectly covered my midsection (Im self-conscious about it) and skimmed over the rest of my curves beautifully.","The slip is separate from the lacy/sparkly overlay which makes it easy to take on and off.","You will not be disappointed!"
"vacation","This dress was cute, runs small and very short.","Worked ok for vacation!"
"vacation","Fit true to size, and I loved it, but there is a built in corset and the metal boning was coming through the fabric and was quite painful.","I tried covering with band-aids, but it didnt really help.","Otherwise it was a great outfit, and I loved it."
"vacation","An original take on florals for Spring!","This tea length style was so flattering and fun to wear, the pairing of  this bold floral print with the subtle ruffle detailing was so different yet completely approachable.","The fabric on the style is very stretchy and truly comfortable against my skin.","It fit true to size and I would suggest sizing up for a backup size.","It must be worn with a strapless bra or NuBra, there is room in the bust so it is great for any cup size.","There is a tie to cinch the waist in but it is not fitted at all and there is ample room.","Spanx or shape wear are suggested but not necessarily needed, I would recommend this dress for the following body types - Apple, Hourglass, Athletic, Pear, Petite, Straight & Narrow, Full Bust, Bump Friendly.","I would wear this style on vacation to a nicer dinner, on a date in the Spring/Summer, to a wedding or semi formal brunch.","I would pair with simple accessories and not deviate from the colors used within the print (lots to choose from; prink, orange, navy, turquoise)."
"vacation","I have a small waist yet this dress still was pretty darn snug around the band.","I was hoping it would hang a bit looser.","Loved the neckline and loved how flowy the bottom was.","If there was one size higher, Id rent again for a bit looser fit.","I normally dont have a problem with things being too tight around the waist, so that was a bit of a disappointment.","Still photographed great though (also, it should be known that I was in austin eating tacos so maybe thats why its so tight 😂) See more on insta of my unlimited subscription: @iamsarahwebb"
"vacation","I wore these pants on a trip to the Middle East.","I figured they would be both fashionable and airy for the desert sun.","Theyre lined, so they were actually less breathable/airy than I thought.","But it was still a great choice for photos/activities on a day when a dress wasnt appropriate.","Would absolutely recommend!"
"vacation","This dress caught my eye and I rented it just because.","I changed into it at a rest stop on the highway and got complimented on the dress as I exited the stall!","I went a size up from my normal size and was really comfortable all day.","The length fell a few inches above my knee, a little shorter than it looks in my pic, which was perfect for me.","The dress was a little snug just below the bust, and my bust/waist are on the smaller side, so consider sizing up if you need more room in this area."
"vacation","The dress has a bit of an A-line skirt, but overall a beautiful and fun dress for a day of exploring a new city and a nice dinner out."
"vacation","The color is beautiful.","The 0R fit fine, but a 2R probably would have been better.","At 52, the pants did not really look cropped but it was still cute.","I found that it was a little unflattering in the stomach area and was pretty see-through in the back."
"vacation","Loved this dress and it is adorable on and so much fun!!","I rented it for a vacation though and the fabric is not cotton but a silky fabric so it was to dressy for me to wear.","I will for sure rent it again though!!","I loved it!","!"
"vacation","The fit was so easy - I have no complaints!"
"vacation","Great structure and fit.","Very flattering and comfortable."
"vacation","Great fit.","Beautiful colors.","Very comfortable, silk blouse."
"vacation","Hugged my curves in all the right ways!","It had my friends drooling <3"
"vacation","Very nice fabric texture.","Not as fluttery and a slightly more dusty pink than as it appears in the photo.","I would take a size down next time."
"vacation","I rented this through unlimited for a beach vacation, wore it all day touring around and one more time to a bbq.","Definitely fits tight but the back has a big stretchy panel making the dress really comfortable even in the heat.","Girly and cute.","Nice stiff cotton material with a pretty, lacy bottom hem.","I will rent this one again."
"vacation","I wore this for one of the formal dinners on a recent cruise.","It was perfect.","While others were in black or red, I stood out in this jewel.","I wore it with nude heels and it really popped.","The fabric is a heavier weight, which might be too hot for outdoor events, but for indoors, it was fine.","Great fit.","It skims the body without looking or feeling clingy."
"vacation","This was a great dress to wear out in Vegas!","I chose to wear it with the v in front, but I could see it being cute with reversed with a statement necklace.","I wore the medium and it was a little big in the waist but fit great in the hips.","It did ride up a bit as I walked but it wasnt a big deal.","I would seriously consider buying this dress as I could see it working for a ton of occasions, even to a work event with a blazer!"
"vacation","I LOVE this dress.","I rented it to wear while on vacation in Florida.","It was technically my backup dress for a wedding, but since I knew my regular dress would work, I wore this on a sunset cruise with my boyfriend.","We sailed out on a catamaran, and it looked stunning in the wind.","The underskirt/lining is fairly tight and hit about midthigh and the overlay of the dress was loose and flowing.","I wore it with a nude strapless bra since the top of the yoke was tan and sort of sheer.","I wore the MR but the LR was probably the better fit.","I wanted it to be a little shorter since I wanted to be able to scramble around the deck easily.","The underskirt was stretchy so it didnt really matter that I wore the smaller size.","Loved it!"
"vacation","The dress has pockets, which adds extra bulk in the hips.","The pockets on the chest made my chest look fuller.","Overall cute and comfortable dress."
"vacation","This top was picture perfect for our island vacation.","I loved the cut and print, very tailored and crisp.","With this kind of bold pattern I would only end wearing this once or twice every few years so it was the perfect item to rent."
"vacation","Many compliments on this top!","I planned to wear this for a night out, but ended up wearing it to work also and felt really chic and comfortable in both venues.","Very stretchy top could accommodate a range of sizes.","May have been a little more flattering in one size down on the bottom portion.","Also, a little more yellow than it appears online."
"vacation","Two words: Camel Toe"
"vacation","Great, easy fit for a night out with friends.","Can be dressed up or down.","I wish I owned it."
"vacation","light, comfortable, pretty.","i wore this to a hawaiian evening party.","i wore a strapless bra."
"vacation","Size runs large - so looked a bit sack-ish from the side - will order medium next time.","But will definitely rent this again!"
"vacation","I rented this for a spring break trip to NYC and wore it every single day.","Absolutely loved how easy it was to use and it was the perfect amount of coverage.","Looked pretty cool, too!"
"vacation","This dress runs large.","Wouldnt suggest it for anyone under 57 or 120 lbs because it is very flowy."
"vacation","This dress is a jaw-dropper while being completely appropriate in coverage.","The only down size is while it fit everywhere else it was a little too small in the shoulder area since I have broad shoulders.","Otherwise it was a perfect dress for a perfect night."
"vacation","Good fit, Im between a 2 and 4 and the 2 fit perfectly."
"vacation","This was a great dress...very comfortable and flattering.","The top seemed a a little big compared to the bottom.","I wore a Small and it fit great on the bottom.","But I probably could have worn an XS on top.","Definitely requires a strapless bra.","But, overall, I loved this dress!"
"vacation","Its a loose fit, so dont expect it to be fitted, but its a gorgeous piece!","I wore it out to the bars last weekend and Im keeping it for a wine tasting/pool trip this weekend, I couldnt give it up!"
"vacation","This was a perfect dress for an evening in wine country.","I wore it with a denim jacket + black heels for a slightly relaxed look; I love how you can totally dress it up though!","The dress runs true to size and is flattering/forgiving, but the chest area cuts in a *little* deep.","Love it!"
"vacation","I got this romper for vacation in Amsterdam.","It was a very fun pattern and was lightweight so easy to pack.","It was a little short (Im 57) but overall I was happy with this rental!"
"vacation","I wore this to a nightclub in Vegas.","I ordered an 8 with the 10 as my back-up size.","I ended up wearing the 10.","The dress does have a lot of stretch, but it is cut small through the butt/thighs.","It was a fun dress to wear, but I felt like the fabric  did bunch/ride up as I walked."
"vacation","I brought this dress down to Mexico for a bachelorette party & it was a big hit.","I wore it out to dinner & a nightclub in Playa Del Carmen - the dress was sexy, classy, & low maintenance (no bra, minimal accessories needed)!","It sat about mid-thigh & the lace detail was just revealing enough.","The only downside is that the fabric was a little thick for the Mexican heat, but I would rent this dress again in heartbeat!"
"vacation","Love this patterned Saloni dress that is perfect for your next vacation.","It is light and fun, with the additional bonus of pockets!","This dress does run true to size and the fabric has no stretch but would definitely go down a size as it was roomy in the bust and throughout the midsection.","I was perfectly comfortable in the bust area with a 34DD bust size.","In addition, these are not adjustable straps.","At 5’5 this dress was about a foot below the knee and should be worn with a strapless bra.","This can easily be dressed up or down with a strappy heel or a cute sandal.","Pair it with some romantic earrings and you have the perfect fun & flirty look!"
"vacation","I love this top!","Its the perfect weekend top.","You can wear it to a summer festival or to brunch!","It has an elastic band around the opening, making it very adjustable.","Because of the beautiful and detailed  lace overlay, it can be considered a crop top.","You can pair it with high waisted shorts for a casual look."
"vacation","Very narrow fit.","I am slim and typically always wear a 2, however this dress was TIGHT!","the positive is that even though I could zip it, it didnt look too tight.","Decided on option B for the sake of being able to breathe.","Very cute dress!"
"vacation","I really loved this romper.","Its super bright, and was perfect for a day on the beach that turned into dinner with friends at a restaurant.","The fabric is thin (wear nude underwear) and it ran small.","I am normally comfortable in a 6 in Lilly Pulitzer, but this was tight in the waist and and shorts.","I wore the 8, which was better in the shorts part but still tight in the waist.","Definitely order a size up."
"vacation","Runs a little large, plenty of room through the middle.","Size down even if you are full breasted.","Flattering style and color.","Slight pattern to the white fabric.","Great sleeves!","Perfect for any occasion."
"vacation","The romper was great fabric and the 2 fit like a glove.","I could put the 0 on but if I lifted my arms, it was much too tight in the crotch area.","I prefer dresses/rompers to fit a little loser so the 2 was perfect.","I got a ton of compliments!","Wore to a beach dinner/dance.","I read reviews about the button being loose around the bust so I brought a safety pin just in case but ran into zero issues."
"vacation","Cannot believe I fit in the XS.","I squeezed into an XS and it looked great.","Normally wear a 2-4 but was running closer to a size 4 for this weekend get away.","Once I got in the dress (needed assistance) it fit great, very comfortable, and looked awesome."
"vacation","The dress is very comfortable overall.","It has a bit of a stretch to it.","It is so incredibly shimmery and so much fun to wear.","The dress is very well constructed and lined and is guaranteed to be a sparkly hit!","People kept commenting on how gorgeous it was.","Cant wait to rent it again!"
"vacation","I wore the small because the XS was not available.","It was forgiving in its fit.","Wore it with pair of Pedro Garcia black heels and really liked it."
"vacation","Super comfortable - really cute.","Could be dressed up or down.","Can be worn day with flats or night with heels and jewelry."
"vacation","Rented this dress for a birthday trip to The Parker in Palm Springs and it was perfect!","Super chic yet very comfortable - I had no problems eating a full birthday meal including dessert which isnt always the case with fancy dresses.","Would definitely rent again!"
"vacation","This was ok- I didnt end up wearing because I wanted it for vacation and it was just blah so I returned on my unlimited in hopes of getting something more exciting before my trip."
"vacation","A cute romper, but slightly boxy on me due to the cut.","It was perfect for putting on for a coffee shop run after the beach and I think you can dress this up to wear to a more casual dinner.","Very nautical!"
"vacation","This dress is the perfect Vegas dress, I wore it on a girls trip and loved it.","The material is thick so its really comfortable, but its definitely short so I decided to size up to the large so that Id get a little extra length."
"vacation","Easy to get on and off."
"vacation","Wore to work with black heels and then also on a beach vacation with nude sandals.","Can easily be dressed up or down.","Looks a bit cuter IRL than in photos."
"vacation","fit well; comfortable, looked great!!","!"
"vacation","Fit fantastic w/ just the right amount of sheerness."
"vacation","Rented for a January weekend in Chicago - it was so chic and cozy."
"vacation","This dress was definitely a tighter fit and very short.","I ended up wearing boy shorts under it so that I would be more comfortable.","It is beautiful in person and very flattering!"
"vacation","Loved the fit and style, really cool patterns.","Wore it out and walked around, only rode up a little bit :)"
"vacation","Nude undies for sure"
"vacation","Comfortable fit and easy for travel with big pockets"
"vacation","I didnt actually end up wearing this dress.","It was a little too full/frilly for my taste.","And just FYI, the top lace is not lined so you can see right through to undergarments!","The fit though was true to size and it would be adorable for a different occasion."
"vacation","This dress was really comfortable to wear.","Like almost all Joie, it runs large, but the medium fit fine!!","Its one of those dresses where you NEVER should size up, but you dont need to size down either.","Overall I liked it, despite a small toothpaste stain.."
"vacation","Fit like a glove.","Beautiful inky navy color.","Loved this dress."
"vacation","This dress was amazing!!","Best rental so far for me.","Seriously wish I could add this to my closet permanently.","I wore it multiple times during my honeymoon in Belize but my husband never got sick of it.","It nips in at the waist just perfectly and the slit is just the right length.","Nice for vacation because you dont need to wear a bra with this one."
"vacation","I would love to buy or at least rerent it if I could find it on your dress list"
"vacation","This sweater is very comfortable & quite warm.","Perfect for early spring or fall.","Its definitely boxy though, and runs on the shorter side which would be the cons in my opinion.","The actual sweater though is very well made and the weave on the front adds some dimension and character.","I wouldnt rent it again, but it did come in handy for a brisk spring vacation in Vermont."
"vacation","The cutest dress.","I was able to go without a bra.","I ended up leaving the back unzipped, because it looked cuter with an open back!"
"vacation","Wore an XL and although it is stretchy I wouldnt order this if you are larger than a 10/12.","It is very short."
"vacation","Fits great and looks sexy but classy.","Only down side is getting it undone to go potty.","Just get some help from the fellow ladies!"
"vacation","The fit of this dress is unbelievable!","Its comfortable, flattering & gorgeous...lots of compliments!","I ordered the 8, but the 6 was better.","The larger size bagged under my breasts, which was not flattering.","Like the other reviewers, I would have kept this dress if I could have!"
"vacation","Very strange to get into and impossible  to do it without help"
"vacation","Fit well, fun to dance in"
"vacation","This dress is so beautiful, and fit me so well.","I know for a fact that it was seen on the runway recently, and currently being sold for $1800.","It is a midi length and was a bit long on me, but I wore ridiculously high heels so it worked.","You will definitely be seen in a crowd in this dress as it is a bright, beautiful cherry red and almost costume like.","The details on this dress such as the dramatic long sleeve and the button detailing make it a one of a kind dress.","If you are looking for a dramatic entrance, then this is the dress to try!","!"
"vacation","Im 54 and this fit perfectly for my height.","I wore semi-high heel booties and layered it with a black coat to complete the look as I took this with me to Europe for vacation.","So comfortable to walk around with, plus it has hidden pockets in the hip area!","Absolutely loved how gorgeous yet oh-so comfortable this was, I may have to rent again soon!"
"vacation","I rented this to take with me to Paris but ended up returning it instead.","The coat was a little thicker than most trench coats, but I expected that after reading the other reviews.","The skirt fell beautifully, but it was a little longer than I expected, almost a tea length on me, but definitely below the knee.","It was a little tight in the shoulders, but I have broad shoulders.","It was beautiful!","If it wasnt going to be so cold where I was going I would have planned to wear it open, but it was going to be too cold for that."
"vacation","At 510 its really only suitable as a bathing suit cover up---but very cute!"
"vacation","It was a beautiful dress and fit wonderfully!","I absolutely loved the color and the design, the fit and the flare.","Would rent again and keep this style and designer in my mind for my next family affair."
"vacation","It is a lovely dress, but it runs small.","I am a solid 6 and I had to keep pulling it down because it was bunching in the back."
"vacation","The straps were too long and kept falling down so I was unable to wear this dress.","It wasnt very fitted throughout the waist either, making it very unflattering.","The pattern and colors were beautiful though!"
"vacation","Loved the pattern and the pop of color.","Nice and fun for Miami, but not form fitting and is a true sheath.","My only complaint was that the material is not the best for warmer weather, as it does not breathe at all."
"vacation","This is a lightweight drop over dress.","I will warn that it is very low cut in front requiring hollywood tape for me to wear and kept slipping from one shoulder to other.","Plus it was super comfortable on an exceptionally hot day when we were walking around town."
"vacation","Fit is perfect - was hesitant to try a jumpsuit, but it fit perfectly - especially because I have a long torso.","LOVE this piece!","!"
"vacation","After reading all the other reviews about the special chest design of the dress, I still decided to rent in an overestimation/optimism towards my tailoring (aka hemming tape) skills.","It didnt work out as expected.","Firstly, as a 54 petite, the XSP was a bit long for me & requires about 3 inch of heels.","Secondly, if you are a A/B cup with amazing abs, the chest design may serve you well.","The open space will create just-enough sexy for you.","However, if you are C  cup or above, the dress makes you look like ready to breastfeeding your twins at any time.","That being said, I ended up not wearing the dress during my vacation.","Hopefully I will make a better choice next time."
"vacation","Loved the fit of this dress and the material had a slight stretch that made it comfortable while not sacrificing the overall look."
"vacation","good because it covers the stomach and arms while still giving some cleavage - sophisticated but still a little wild.....loved the actual dress."
"vacation","It fit perfectly, but I ordered large for my usual size."
"vacation","At 57 this was still very long and I had to hitch it up while walking around - even with heeled boots.","However, I love the casual style that can be dressed up and was perfect for my occasion."
"vacation","This dress is so figure flattering!","It is super short and the cutouts in the skirt part can show your hoo-ha if you arent careful.","I wore a black slip under it.","I love the plunging neckline on this.","I am 58 and it was borderline too short for me, but I wore it anyway because the top part is so sexy.","I loved this dress."
"vacation","No cons--simply amazing"
"vacation","This dress was very pretty but I definitely should have gotten the 0 because the 2 was way too big.","It just didnt give my body any shape at all.","I also thought the material was going to be more sheer, lightweight and flowy but it was much thicker, heavier and stiffer than I had imagined.","So glad I have the unlimited membership to try out as many dresses as I want!"
"vacation","I wore this on a recent trip to Art Basel in Miami, and it totally went with the vibe.","It was actually very flattering for a jumpsuit, and I shockingly did not have to wear a bra.","I would definitely rent again come summer or for another trip!"
"vacation","Fun, easy dress for the summer!","I liked the deep pink color and the ribbon tie in the back!","My only complaint is that although the dress fits loosely and comfortably, the high neck felt a bit like a turtleneck.","Otherwise, it was a fun rental!"
"vacation","This was the perfect vacation dress for a semi formal tropical night.","Fun and a little flouncy.","Super comfortable and easy to dance in.","I wore it with no bra at all because I was a little sunburned and the dress held me in perfectly.","Really pretty from the back.","I received a lot of compliments.","More interesting than a typical black dress."
"vacation","It fit well and was very flattering but when I turned around you could see my entire bra.","The band doesnt line up with any reasonable bra.","When I wore a strapless it made the front part not look right.","If Im being honest this is more meant for someone with no boobs or fake ones.","Otherwise it fit really well and was flattering.","The shorts werent too short like most rompers and the front was very flattering on the stomach area."
"vacation","Adorable dress.","Fits more like an 8 than a 12.","Made very small."
"vacation","This dress is so beautiful and so much fun!","Know that you most likely wont be able to wear a bra, even a strapless bar was visible in the front and back of the dress.","This dress is very heavy with a ton of fabric and was pretty tricky to shimmy into - size up!"
"vacation","The fit is great, and this was easy.","I went from flying to the car to meetings and I had no problem.","The dress is longer in the back and the sides which helps to make it a work tonight dress."
"vacation","Stunning!","People stopped me on the street to compliment me.","I wore a strapless bra and boy short style body shaper."
"vacation","Fit great, the waistband was in placed in a great spot for a slimming effect.","The pleats took a little getting used to, the skirt is extra full and a short liner underneath.","Definitely wear no show panties because even with all the pleats lines show!","Also, be sure to check the liner every time you stand up, if it gets slightly twisted you will have a very strange line across your rear.","Length was great.","Would drag with flats (what the photo is of), but could wear up to a 3 heel.","I would not recommend a long for anyone under 510."
"vacation","I felt comfortable to dance with the dress.","Its truly a unique dress that will make heads turn."
"vacation","A little snug in the thighs.","Modest length.","Arm holes are big, so I needed to wear a slip dress under it.","I was very happy with this little number!!","!"
"vacation","I know this is a sheath dress, but the 42 was quite roomy.","I would have felt more comfortable in a smaller size.","the lace is a little snagged already...even though it is a strong weave."
"vacation","Had this dress delivered to wear on Easter during a vacation to California.","So nice to have it show up in CA without having to pack a dress in my luggage.","Very nice quality and appropriate for the casual occasion."
"vacation","pros is i figured two ways to wearing it and changing the straps around"
"vacation","I got so many compliments in this dress, and I felt like a rockstar!","The fabric was amazing.","It was the perfect length with flats (no dragging, but no awkward ankles).","I really didnt want to send it back"
"vacation","I am normally a size 4 and got the small but the extra small would have been a much better fit.","I wore it anyway though - looked cute even if loose!"
"vacation","I got this at the RTR Store in Vegas-- it was light and comfy, and I LOVED the open back!","Im 56 and it did feel a little short, and if youre chesty you might need a little backless bra, but other than that I loved it!"
"vacation","Great for a girl with a large bust (36G).","Needed a few safety pins because the dress is so low cut, but with that quick fix it was perfect for a night out in Vegas!"
"vacation","Dress was super comfortable and great material.","Actually wore it for a night out on the water, but could be great for a vacation day or dinner outfit.","Great dress to dress up or even down.","Color is a pale baby blue.","In terms of sizing, it is on the baggier/free form side and you could order a size down from what you normally order if you are smaller on top."
"vacation","im a 34C which makes this shirt impossible to wear without a strapless bra.","it shows a ton of cleavage.","i wore a black one so it matched, but this shirt is definitely cuter on someone with a smaller chest"
"vacation","Got this with tags still on it.","As is typical with Lilly Pulitzer shift dresses, I had to order the 12 to fit my booty.","The top was swimming on me even though I wore with a padded strapless.","A 10 would not have fit my hips.","All in all beautiful gold detailing on the top and a casual white fabric on bottom.","I wore with rose gold gladiator sandals to dress it down a bit.","I felt glamorous but not sure Lilly dresses are best for my body type.","Classy dress though."
"vacation","I love this dress!","Unfortunately, I havent had a chance to wear it yet.","I was just getting some ideas for an upcoming trip to Maui.","I usually wear a 6 or 8 dress.","I ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly.","With the open lower back and short skirt, I thought it wasnt appropriate for work, but will be great for an evening out during the summer or even for a daytime party.","The fabric was very thick and beautiful.","Loved the colors too.","Will definitely rent again for my trip!","I just hope its available when I need it."
"vacation","This dress was amazing, the only thing I would warn ladies about is that its super short.","Be sure to have a pair of sturdy knickers on!"
"vacation","I was underwhelmed by this dress.","It was fun and sparkly but it wasnt the most flattering thing Ive ever put on my body.","I typically wear a 4 or 6 and thought this ran pretty large.","I wish I had ordered the 4.","Its strange to say for something so sequined, but this felt pretty conservative -- it skimmed my knees and the cleavage felt fairly covered.","The front rouching didnt flatter as I hoped.","It was fun for Vegas, but I wouldnt rent it again.","The other girls pictured are also wearing RTR dresses and the one in the middle was fab in person (shes also SUPER slim and would look great in anything).","The one on the right (Nicole Miller) was pretty, too, but not as nice in person as in photos."
"vacation","When we got bumped to first class on our flight to Hawaii, my glamorous look made me feel like a rockstar.","It felt like everyone who walked by on the plane looked at me and thought, Yeah.","She fits the profile of First Class.","I loved the preview look so much, I also sprang for some white capris, which completed my vacation look!"
"vacation","The dress is beautiful and photographs really well.","I got so many compliments.","It was also great for travel.","I will definitely rent this one again."
"vacation","I order a size up in this dress and Im glad I did.","The waist was a little loose on me, but I have wide shoulders so I needed the 4.","The color is not overwhelming.","The bow details are so sweet.","I got so many compliments I ended up wearing this twice during my rental period (and almost considered buying!).","Did not disappoint."
"vacation","The dress fits very snug - I didnt have a chance to try on the medium but I think I might have been better off.","The fit made me very aware of my belly - which isnt 100% model flat but isnt normally bad either (Im normally a size 2).","I liked the long sleeves because I didnt need a coat, but they too were snug so I did get a little warm inside and couldnt really roll them up or anything.","The material and sequins are very nice and comfortable - the lining on the dress is excellent so I didnt feel poked by the sequins, though they did tend to catch on each other - my arm got stuck to my chest/side more than once; probably a sign of wear on the dress.","If I were going to do it over again, Id still get this dress - but Id bring Spanx or get a size up."
"vacation","I am definitely a girl with hips and small waist/bust and this dress flattered it all!","I usually wear a Medium in dresses but this is more of a form fitting dress so wore a Large for my hips"
"vacation","Well-fitting dress with lining."
"vacation","Super comfortable and easy to wear.","Very flattering.","Wish I could buy it!"
"vacation","I wore this for a fancy gala dinner on a cruise.","The 6 fit fine as well, but the 4 was definitely better as it was more form fitting."
"vacation","I ended up receiving this dress when an alternate dress from the same designer was unavailable at the last minute.","I absolutely loved it and wish I could have kept it!","The slight A-line skirt was flattering and the scalloped edges added a little extra interest to the dress.","Herve Leger dresses are always skin tight (they kind of act like a full body Spanx) so size up.","The XS wouldnt fit over my hips (size 25 waist, 35 inch hips).","The small was snug in the right way.","I felt like a million bucks!"
"vacation","This fits true to size.","The short part of the romper is high waisted which makes it look more classy.","It is very well made and Im really picky about clothes.","This isActually the first RTR I wore after about ordering 4 different shipments.","Would rent again!"
"vacation","Being broad in the shoulders with athletic arms, the initial fit was snug around the arm-holes.","Fabric gave and contoured nicely after dressing, however."
"vacation"," Perfect fit, super comfortable, and was east to dress up for a night out!"
"vacation","Everyone complimented me on this dress in person and later on photos in social media.","BEAUTIFUL colors in person.","Super comfortable.","Love the buttons down the front and the pockets.","Want to buy this for real life!","!"
"vacation","It was too cold, so I didnt get to wear this.","It also came dirty ( gross) and the phone lines were down.","BUT if it had been warm and the dress was clean, I would have loved wearing it and you will enjoy it too."
"vacation","Rented this for a vacation.","Looks great with a tan.","Dress is roomy in the middle with a sexy neckline and shoulder cut-outs.","The hemline also adds some interest.","It was a good length for me, might be too short on a taller person."
"vacation","I am not normally one for big prints, but this one is very flattering.","True to size.","The placement of the straps is very flattering as is the hemline.","I was on a beach vacation, so no where fancy to go.","Dressed it down with sandals and had a great dinner out.","Would rent this again."
"vacation","Wore this to an outdoor awards BBQ.","Very cute dress.","Loved the bright colors.","Couldnt really wear a bra with this, because strapless bra showed in the back and under arms.","Perhaps some other creative bra that I dont own would have worked.","But, Im small in the chest, so I just went without.","The only downside was that it was VERY hot the day I wore this and the lining (which is how I could wear this without a bra) made the dress much hotter.","Otherwise, loved it and would rent again.","Wouldnt suggest for a very hot day."
"vacation","Would definitely rent again!"
"vacation","Wore for a night out in Vegas.","As always, Herve fits like a glove.","A must rent!"
"vacation","Great fit if youre tall.","Received tons of compliments."
"vacation","Very elegant and comfortable.","I ended up choosing another dress that I ordered instead.","Just needed a little more pizazz for a night out."
"vacation","Let me tell you--this dress is the absolute best rental Ive ever had from RTR to date.","The fit was perfect, the print was to die for, and the style is edgy and cute and sexy at the same time.","It was perfect for a 24/7 shindig: conference during the day, cocktail party in the afternoon, and the bar at night.","I got sooooo many compliments on this dress.","I wore the skirt a second time on my vacation with a different brightly colored crop top and it worked amazing."
"vacation","It hugged all of the right places on my slim, hourglass figure.","It was comfortable and Honestly i would love to buy the dress to wear it over and over!"
"vacation","I originally got this as my back up dress to Hervé Legers Kane Dress but found that this dress is actually way more flattering for an hourglass shape, it really cinches in your waist and emphasized you hips and bust ( although I feel like it does run a tad large up top).","I ended up loving this dress way more than I expected and would definitely recommend renting it especially for ladies with curves."
"vacation","If I lived in a colder climate I would own this jacket.","I think it runs a tad big.","I got the M, I am 5 10 and the sleeves were still a tad long.","If I were going to wear it again and not layer sweaters under I think I would get the S."
"vacation","Wore this jumper on a hot summer night in Newport RI and I felt amazing - so comfortable and unique!","I dont agree with the other reviewers saying to go up a size - but then again I have a small waist and chest so that may have something to do with it."
"vacation","I got a small and a medium as a back up in this dress, but unfortunately my size was somewhere in the middle.","The medium was a bit too big around the waist, belly, and back and just didnt seem to fit right.","The small was just small everywhere.","I ended wearing the small since we were in Vegas and short and tight is acceptable for Vegas.","But it was VERY short.","I am 511 and it barely covered my booty.","The lace was pretty, but it was starting to pull in a lot of places and looked a bit worn.","I wore Nubra with the dress, but some could get away with wearing nothing.","My husband thought I looked beautiful, but this was not my favorite dress."
"vacation","I rented this for a ladies weekend in Las Vegas in May, and I absolutely loved wearing it.","I typically shy away from sexy outfits, but this was a perfect compromise for me.","The material is on the thicker side, so I dont know that I would have been as happy had we gone in the summer, but I felt amazing and confident while out at dinner and going dancing afterwards (PS - Im a full 34C, but the material was so sturdy that I was actually able to go totally bra-less that night).","The jumpsuit is actually a lighter navy color than it appears on the model, though I think the one I rented may have just been cleaned one too many times, and had begun to lighten somewhat.","I loved the jumpsuit so much that I actually tracked it down and bought it for myself!"
"vacation","I LOVED the way this dress fit in the top!","I didnt even need a bra.","Straps are adjustable.","I felt so fun and pretty in this dress!","My only con would be the length.","I wore this for a night out on vacation.","We did a lot of walking and I wanted to wear flats.","It was so long I was forced to wear wedges.","My feet were killing me the next day.","beautiful dress though.","I would rent again!"
"vacation","Great fit and extremely flattering!","I wanted a top that had a little more flare and this was the perfect top for that."
"vacation","Loved this dress!","Pros: Beautiful colors, loved the cut-out, nice material, can wear without a braCons: Did not come with the tie detail, material does not stretch, the hook-and-eye closure dug into my back when I leaned back in a chair, and the dress was a bit long (hit below the knee, but I am 52)Worn with the Ella Carter Alex Earrings and the Kate Spade Garden Party Statement Bracelet.","I cant comment on whether or not the dress is true to size because I am postpartum and I am not back to my normal weight."
"vacation","This dress was wonderful.","Very attractive and slimming fit.","Sorry the pic is hard to see.","Many of our pics didnt come out from that night.",":("
"vacation","I got this dress for going out while on vacation in South America.","It was perfect!","Extremely figure flattering and sexy but still classy, with the higher neckline.","I got many compliments on the dress and felt great in it.","The color is a really pretty raspberry and the fit is true to size, though if you are between sizes, you should go with the larger.","A great dress Ill probably rent again!"
"vacation","I rented this dress for a girls weekend in Nashville.","Its the perfect daytime dress.","Comfortable to walk around in and very flattering.","I usually wear  0, but the 0 was a little tight around the bust.","The 2 fit perfectly however!","You really need a statement necklace with this dress.","Other wise its a little plain.","I rented the Kate Spade daytime jewels pink necklace and it went perfectly.","I got a ton of compliments on this dress, even from random people on the street!"
"vacation","If you are going to Vegas, get this dress.","I had a girl compliment me before I got in the elevator, and many other strangers compliment my dress throughout the night.","I wore a regular bra and used garment tape to keep the low neckline in check.","It is super figure flattering, and the gold is perfect.","I did get a little scratchy under my arms, but its the price you pay for such an awesome party dress!"
"vacation","Absolutely loved everything about this dress.","It was comfortable, hid any tummy problem areas, perfect length, the cut around the neck made me feel super feminine and diminished the wideness of my man shoulders.","Favorite RTR yet, and I received lots of compliments!","You want to rent this one."
"vacation","I wore this one of the nights on my honeymoon in Amalfi.","It was a bit too tight in chest/stomach, but was able to zip it up!","wore it with jeans and a pashmina would order again in size 6"
"vacation","This dress is really cute on.","I wore it twice on vacation and was very pleased with the dress.","The fabric is soft and style is very feminine.","The cut out shoulders make it interesting.","The print and color is perfect for a fall/winter dress.","Wore it with boots on one occasion and nude pumps at another.","Both looked great.","This is perfect for dressing up or down.","Highly recommend it."
"vacation","The material and pattern/colors of this shirt were better than the picture makes it look.","Everyone I was with complimented me on it.","I have a longer torso so my stomach showed a tiny bit but not a lot."
"vacation","So unfortunately none of my pictures turned out well, but this dress was gorgeous!","I ordered the 2R and 4R and both of them fit.","However, since I have a large bust, the 2R was choking me so I wore the 4R.","Other than the neck/chest areas, the dress basically fit the same.","It was super comfortable to wear and even strangers were complementing me!","Definitely would recommend this dress for a wedding or formal event."
"vacation","No details to submit."
"vacation","This was great for a night out in Carmel / Monterrey, CA... nice to have sleeves for cool evenings.","But yall, it is SHORT!","Im almost 59 and it was clear I couldnt (or shouldnt) bend over or raise my arms.","But I felt beautiful and got a genuine WOW, you look AMAZING!","from my S.O.","Im between a size 4 and 6, and based on the reviews I went with the 4 which I think was the right decision.","So, fits true-to-size or slightly large."
"vacation","Way too bulky in the middle ....","I think even if I had gotten the small it would have been an awkward fit."
"vacation","The fit was perfect...not stretchy so make sure you order the correct size.","Gorgeous dress the only flaw was the inside of my upper arm rubbing against the fabric the sequins were rough on my skin but definitely not enough to bother or regret this dress"
"vacation","This was the perfect jacket to wear for a winter getaway.","I had it sent to the place I was staying so I didnt have to pack a bulky jacket in my luggage (more room for souvenirs!)","Everyone has jackets like this in NYC so I fit right in!","The fur on the coat is quite furry.","Great jacket to wear fancy or casual.","I wish I could own this!"
"vacation","I wore this dress on vacation recently in LA.","The material is on the heavy side and the lace is very beautiful and detailed in person.","The light lace is more of a pale pink color in person.","For a night out it was a little longer than I had hoped but this would be perfect for a wedding or charity function.","Fit was true to size and I had plenty of room to feel comfortable."
"vacation","Pretty"
"vacation","I really loved this skirt!","I rented it for vacation and needed long skirts for where I was going.","Im 52 so I had a lot of trouble finding options on RTR that I wasnt tripping over.","this skirt is great, it hit about floor length for me but I could still easily wear flats with it.","Its thin, breezy fabric so I didnt feel weighed down by it at all.","The only thing to note is that theres zero stretch in the waist, so I sized up to a Small.","I tried the XS on and it looked great but when I sat down, it felt too tight on my stomach.","The Small was great, looked pretty similar on and felt much more comfortable on the waist."
"vacation","I´m petite and the back of this dress just skimmed the ground when I wore it.","I brought it on vacation to Florida with my girlfriends and loved it.","Was perfect to throw on over a bathing suit to run to the store and could also dress it up a little for dinner at a local restaurant.","Relaxed, casual and really fun.","Very flowy in the breeze."
"vacation","I absolutely ADORE this dress.","It was perfect for a VIP concert experience for my favorite band.","It definitely runs a little short, but being 55, it fell perfectly for me.","I actually wore Converse sneakers under it.","The back could make it a little tricky bra wise, and I could have gone without.","But I ended up getting one of those sticky bras from Target and it was perfect.","The colors are BEAUTIFUL.","Fabric is light and breezy.","Con, when the sun went down, with the bare mid section and back, I was freezing.","So just be prepared with a cardigan or jacket!","I hope I have another reason to rent this dress.","It was a part of one of the best and most memorable nights of my life!"
"vacation","This dress is so flattering - I got tons of compliments.","I wore it on a vacation with my 65 year old mother.","It covered just enough that she was happy, but had some sex appeal thanks to the wrap silhouette.","The fabric is smooth and slippery and it has great movement.","I would definitely rent this again."
"vacation","The material had a stretchy quality to it to help it fit just right, but was also form fitting.","I received many compliments on this dress!"
"vacation","This dress was so comfortable!","I wore it for my birthday in Vegas.","I ordered the small and medium and felt more comfortable in the medium.","The fabric was thick enough I chose not to wear a bra.","I am tall and this dress is short but it worked for my occasion.","I wore it with the Phoenix necklace which I got lots of compliments on!"
"vacation","I love Herve Leger, and his dresses are perfect for Vegas.","The color of this dress is great, I loved the dark purple.","But the fit is small!","I have rented other Herve Leger dresses in size S and they fit great, this one however took 2 people to zip.","I would recommend this dress, just make sure you size up!"
"vacation","Had a hard time giving it back!","Really flattering."
"vacation","I rented this dress for my husbands work trip to Santa Barbara.","The fabric was so nice and I loved how the dress flowed.","Per other reviews and being 24 weeks pregnant I rented a large and that was exactly the size I needed.","I gave this dress a 4 star because the neck was so tight!","If you hate things tight on your neck, this dress is not for you.","This dress would be perfect for a outdoor wedding or bridal/baby shower.","And yes it is bump friendly at 24 weeks!"
"vacation","Very nice fabric.","Looks casual but not sloppy.","Change shoes night on town.","Versitile."
"vacation","The cuts and patterns are extremely flattering.","I needed to wear a nude bra and underwear because it is a little see-through."
"vacation","I was skeptical about how this would compliment my frame, but I absolutely LOVED it!","Wore it for vacation and received many compliments!","Very complimentary to petite, slim frame.","I tucked the ruffle sleeves under my arms and just used the spaghetti straps, wore with a strapless bra.","The material is excellent for hot weather - it doesnt wrinkle easily while wearing or while packed in luggage for travel.","I highly recommend!","I complimented it with necklace and flat sandals.","I would rent again."
"vacation","Absolutely gorgeous!"
"vacation","The fit is true to size, thick and comfortable fabric which was surprisingly forgiving.","Long sleeves balanced out the rest of the dress well.","I did not have an issue with length or sequence snagging.","I wore it for a night out with friends while on vacation in Las Vegas, and it couldnt have been more perfect.","Lots of fun, flattering, and loud without being over the top.","(disclaimer: this is a PARTY dress!","Would be entirely inappropriate for daytime or formal) Felt great in this dress, thanks RTR!"
"vacation","This was such a great dress.","I wore it on vacation, and it was perfect.","You will need to wear a strapless bra with it - or a halter bra.","Very light-weight and airy.","Will want to rent again!"
"vacation","The dress was beautiful.","It was really fun to dance in for the wedding.","There was not much fabric in the check, so it left little to be desired."
"vacation","I wore this more than anything else on our road trip down the keys.","Its cute, comfortable, looks great with a belt or without.","Good for swimsuit cover up or for a night out on the town.","I will rent again for vacays!"
"vacation","Cute but a little ill-fitting for a petite frame."
"vacation","Rented this dress for Las Vegas!","I usually wear a size 8 and got the size 6 as a backup.","The six fit me better in the bust area so wore the 6 and was comfortable all night in this dress.","Gets little scratchy under the arms.","Will def.","rent again!"
"vacation","This is a perfect summer dress, great for an occasion and/or going out.","It was very lightweight (perf for HOT Vegas), flattering.","I do think that the top was pretty snug for me.","It definitely compressed my chest and would have been more flattering in terms of shape if my chest wasnt so smooshed.","I love the straps and skirt details."
"vacation","The fit was great.","The elastic band allowed me to adjust the dress to the length I desired.","Im 53 so it did feel like it was more on the shorter end when the middle band was more scrunched together than stretched out.","The fabric was great!","I was worried I would get hot or sweat in it since it is still warm out, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was breathable.","I highly recommend and will likely rent again :)"
"vacation","Perfect fit!","It does not give much in the chest/ribcage area so if you have bigger on top (or in between sizes) you may need to size up.","Would buy this if possible!"
"vacation","I loved this romper - the colors were really fun and I loved the open back.","I wore a black bra, and even though it showed, it was no big deal.","A red bra would have been even more fun though.","I only wish the inside waistband was the same satiny-soft material that the rest of the romper had.","A great rental!"
"vacation","I ordered this as a backup dress and didnt end up wearing it.","Its pretty fitted and after a day of eating and drinking in Vegas i couldnt pull this off =).","I would suggest ordering a size up just in case, i wanted to but they didnt have it in stock so i rolled the dice.","Would recommend as its a very cute dress but a bra and spanx are probably out of the question with how the dress is cut."
"vacation","I was a little weary about this dress but when I tried it on it fit like a glove.","Sometimes FreePeople tends to run a little oversize and this dress was perfectly fitted.","The pattern is kind of unusual but I loved it and got a lot of compliments on it!"
"vacation","This dress is great as a beach cover-up or for everyday wear.","Its flowy and the material is very comfortable."
"vacation","The dress was very flattering and was tight in all the right places.","Loved it."
"vacation","I absolutely loved this maxi dress from hunter bell.","Very comfortable and cute!","The 2R was the perfect length for me with 1 inch sandals- Im 57.","My only complaint was that the shoulder straps kept loosening.","Overall one of my favorite rentals."
"vacation","Have rented three times.","Cannot say enough good things.","Makes every outfit fabulous!"
"vacation","super soft cotton lining makes this dress lay beautifully but still maintains the sophistication of lace.","Great fun color, easy to dress up or dress down."
"vacation","This was a great dress to wear brunching on shopping while vacationing in LA.","Its a short maxi so it worked perfectly for me -- Im 52.","I loved the cut outs!","The only thing is that it felt like I was carrying around a lot of fabric.","I ended up feeling hot and sweaty underneath the dress at points.","But its beautiful.","And its casual enough to wear just to brunch or nice enough to wear to a wedding."
"vacation","Dress is very short!"
"vacation","This dress was lovely - very shimmery and a standout for sure.","The length was great, but the liner on the dress kept riding up all night long, so that is my only complaint.","Other than that, a great dress - comfortable and got compliments all night long!","Side note- I ordered the 10 as a backup, and it was obvious that the liner had been replaced with a different non-stretchy fabric, making the bottom of it fit much tighter than the 8 - so beware if you are ordering a size 10!","I was a bit disappointed with that part of my order, luckily the smaller size fit me, but if it hadnt I would have been very upset."
"vacation","Extremely flattering, but modest, for curves.","I always struggle with butt and boobs fitting in dresses, so its great that the fabric is flexible and lightweight.","The skirt swishes as you walk, and the pattern is cheerful.","All around just a joyful, spirit-lifting dress!"
"vacation","Great fabric, and elastic waist makes it super comfortable."
"vacation","I thought it was a bit boxy.","Very warm.","Unfortunately, it never ended up being cold enough for me to wear it.","Very nice burgundy color.","Also, I think the smell for leather dry cleaning might be a bit different.","It smelled perfumy in a way"
"vacation","fits great and true to size, but I am 56 and it came to my ankles"
"vacation","Wore to a music festival in Austin- it was the perfect look!","It was a little short in the waist, so if you are tall, Id order a size up.","I should have gotten a medium."
"vacation","I rented this for a vacation in Hawaii.","It was perfect!","It flows nicely in the breeze and is comfortable while also showing off your figure."
"vacation","Wore this to a bonfire on the beach during a destination wedding weekend.","Love the length because its not too long (more midi length) so not tripping over it.","Fits true to size.","More fitted than I expected which I liked because it was flattering.","Would definitely rent again."
"vacation","I wore this in Vegas out celebrating my birthday.","It was very comfortable and I felt so sexy.","I received a bunch of complments from complete strangers.","I would highly recommend this dress.","The size small was not available so I tried on a medium which was pretty baggy.","I didnt think the extra small would fit, but the dress was so stretchy it fit perfectly.","It hugged all my curves and I wasnt spilling out anywhere.","Definitely a great dress for an hourglass figure."
"vacation","Too Big.","Fabric a little heavy for a hot night."
"vacation","I really liked how this dress had pockets and the fabric felt nice, but there wasnt any shape to it.","I ended up not wearing it."
"vacation","Perfect vacation dress"
"vacation","I was wonderful!","I felt SEXY in it, and it still covers your butt.","I have massive boobs on a small frame, and usually have to size up for them, this dress has room.","I wore the top unbuttoned with some pearls and wedges for our plane ride to Bonaire!","My husband REALLY liked how it made me look hourglass.","Its a neat dress!","However... untie the waist when going through TSA!","I had to get patted down AGAIN!"
"vacation","Great dress - cool pattern that pairs with anything, heavy well-made fabric.","A bit on the short side and a tight fit, but flattering.","I may try a medium next time.","Would look great with tights and boots, quite heavy for summer."
"vacation","This dress was cute, loved the color!","It was pretty shapeless and a bit short.","However, I received lots of compliments in it!"
"vacation","I would consider purchasing this one.","I really loved it!","The mesh was super fun!","The material wasnt what I expected but it was fine.","Relatively comfortable.","Wasnt super comfortable in the arm area.","The mesh was a bit challenging to zip.","I agree with the other reviews, that it runs relatively large.","I wear a 2/4 and typically in RTR items I have scored better with a size 4.","This was a perfect fit in a size 2.","You need strapless bra as well.","I definitely got noticed in this one!"
"vacation","Fabric is great for the hot weather.","Flower detail was very cute.","And the beige was surprisingly a nice color and not dull.","Paired with nude heels or wedges and its a very cute day or night dress.","Loved!","Will rent again."
"vacation","Looked nice, straps slightly too long"
"vacation","This dress was very pretty, but just too big for my smaller frame.","The straps were insanely large, and the dress was too long and hit mid-shin.","It just doesnt work well with smaller frames.","I was lost in the dress and it just looked frumpy :( I sized up based on the reviews, but maybe should have kept my regular size, not sure if that would have helped."
"vacation","This dress was so comfortable!","The fabric was breathable and lightweight.","The cut was perfect for a a growing bump.","It was a little short when I sat down, but nothing that wasnt appropriate for the beach.","Definitely recommend for any future mommas needing a good vacation dress!"
"vacation","Rented this for my European vacation this summer, as well as for my sister-in-laws baby shower.","Compliments every time, and the detail on this dress is spectacular.","It may come across as a loud print, but it is really spectacular.","Would definitely rent again."
"vacation","This dress does run small as the reviews say.","I wanted to order a size 8 in the dress; however, it was unavailable.","I decided to go for the 6 and wished for the best.","The 6 was difficult to zip (partially because the zipper was very stiff) however it did look really great.","Once the dress zipped it did not even feel tight it was just difficult to get on."
"vacation","Wore this on vacation in Florida!","AMAZING print!!","Got many compliments when I wore it to brunch.","Fabric is very soft and super stretchy.","Regular length was perfect for my height with sandals.","I loved the v-neckline and cutout!","Perfect for a vacation or wedding!"
"vacation","This dress was much more form fitting than I had originally thought when I reserved it does have some stretch so it wasnt an issue.","I loved the sequins for my birthday night in New Orleans!","Also the sequins arent itchy like more dresses are.","Overall I loved the dress and would recommend."
"vacation","This overall has a stunning color and the cut is different!","It was perfect for my vacation and had so much compliments from people when I wore it at the fair.","Every woman (young and old) gave me so much compliments as the cut and design is so unique!","Would rent it again!"
"vacation","Dress is beautiful!","Great color and super flowy.","Only issue is the waist area is super tight while the rest of the dress is kind of loose."
"vacation","The dress was longer on me, hitting closer to my ankles than my shins, but it worked out fine with wedges (and I was actually sitting for most of the evening).","Super comfortable and pretty!"
"vacation","The romper is really light and travels well.","My only issue is that it wrinkled a bit and was really short.","Overall, however, an adorable jumper!"
"vacation","everyone loved these pants.","they are so fun and comfortable.","they are fitted in the waist and flowy in the legs"
"vacation","This was a great shirt.","I most likely could have went down a size but overall it was a fun shirt!"
"vacation","First, the leather smells amazing.","The jacket is a good fit for petite women and kept me warm on a trip to Iceland.","I probably could have gotten away with the small but the medium was very comfortable with layers underneath and I could snap it shut all the way up.","Not boxy or too long, but it was heavier than I was expecting, which wasnt bad but something to keep in mind."
"vacation"," My husband will actually request me to wear this dress, Ive kept it for 3 months because he doesnt want me to send it back!"
"vacation","LOVE this dress.","Its super cute and fits nicely.","I like the zipper in the front, you can zip it all the way up and be conservative or leave it a little low and show a little chest.","Fabric is very light so you wont feel hot if the sun is beaming down on you."
"vacation","I really like the material.","It was a very laid back, but super cute dress for a vacation/day-time event.","I would definitely rent it again and wish there were more dresses like this one."
"vacation","I wore this on our last night out in Vegas - Dinner, Cirque du Soleil and some roulette - the dealer complimented the pattern.","I love renting Clover Canyon, this is my third dress of theirs (and second for this trip) and I know they will fit well and be flattering.","The material is sleek, comfortable and forgiving and the prints are so much fun.","I love the scuba material - I know not everyone is a fan, but I find it so comfy.","My boyfriend liked the dress too and hes usually not a fan of anything too loud.","I was shocked that he suggested it.","It was really fun to wear."
"vacation","Very comfortable"
"vacation","I liked this dress a lot, although it was very heavy for a beach vacation.","It really looked great on and the cut out at the stomach is a perfect detail to add something interesting without being over the top.","The only downsides were that the material presses against your skin a little too much around the cut out which can look kind of unflattering and that it really was heavy for a warm day."
"vacation","It was a comfortable, well made dress - it fit true to size and i loved the waistline."
"vacation","This dress is amazing on!","I felt so incredibly sexy in it -- I got compliments everywhere we went.","Because its bloused, it is very forgiving on the waistline, so I felt very comfortable in it.","Its short enough to make your legs look really long, but not so short that you cant sit in it."
"vacation","The fabric felt high quality, the fit was great, and I loved the ruffle on the side.","The only issue I have with it is I wish it was an inch longer for a little bit more coverage, but it definitely wasnt too short to wear.","Im considering buying it so I dont have to send it back!"
"vacation","I rented this for a vacation dress but it ended up being much cooler out than I anticipated so I added leggings and a denim jacket...perfect casual day wear!","The dress is lined and the neckline is such that I was better off not wearing a bra at all.","Im a bottom-heavy size 4 and the size 2 was definitely the right size.","If youre looking for waist definition, this is not your dress!","Id also be careful in windy conditions...it tends to fly up.","However this was a nice comfy casual dress that I enjoyed wearing."
"vacation","This romper was true to size and was perfect for a night at Vegas clubs.","I normally wear a size 4/6 and the small fit perfectly.","It does show a lot of cleavage, so I used fashion tape just in case.","But honestly, my 34 DD chest fit fine and I did not need the tape.","The straps are half adjustable, but not for the full length of the straps."
"vacation","Wore to the Russian tea room and a Broadway play when recently in NY in September during fashion week.","Received many compliments.","This dress made me feel very fashionable without being over the top."
"vacation","Lovely blouse!","It was brand new when I received it, with the tags still attached, so that was great!.","I rented through my Unlimited account and wore it several times, always gaining compliments.","High quality silk with a luxurious feel."
"vacation","I loved the scalloped hem, fabric and beautiful color of this dress.","I did, however, think this dress ran large.","I requested a 6 and a 4 (Im usually in between sizes) and the 4 was rather big on me."
"vacation","This dress was a little loose, even thou I am a busty gal.","But the effect was great.","The skirt flows when you walk, the fabric is great and lightweight."
"vacation","I was on vacation in Miami and had brought this (and another RTR dress) with me.","It was a beautiful fit; although tight, it moved well and was very comfortable.","I loved that the sequins were so small that it fully complimented the look of the dress without taking away from the cut."
"vacation","Fit really well and was comfortable to wear."
"vacation","I didnt love this dress.","I have worn Herve dresses before and know how tiiiight and form fitting they can be, but this one was a little too tight even though it was the medium.","I also got a small, but couldnt eveb begin to get my body into it.","The strap at the back on the dress I got was loose and worn out, which sometimes made it drape weirdly, which I didnt like.","I wore this dress for a night in Vegas with my husband.","I did not have to wear a bra or tape.","I wore nude wedges."
"vacation","Loved the style of the dress.","But when I walked, it kept riding up--and it was very short to begin with--and I was in Vegas!","It was maybe a 1/2in from the bottom of my butt.","Keep in mind I am 5ft 10in.","Because of the length issues, I had to wear the large, instead of my usual medium size."
"vacation","I absolutely loved this dress and it was so comfortable.","Extremely low cut, but for a night out in Vegas, I was okay with that.","The draping was very flattering on my curvy figure, and hid what I wanted it to hide.","I ended up wearing a size up from what I ordered, simply because I wanted a little more length in the back and for it to be a little loose on me in the 110 degree heat.","The green sequins were beautiful, and looked like nothing else that anyone was wearing in the room.","Ill be renting this same dress for my cruise next month because I loved it so much.","I would just recommend having someone around to help you zip it up.","Due to the sequins, the zipper can be a little difficult."
"vacation","Light, casual, easy to wear."
"vacation","Love the print and texture of this shirt - it ran a little big, so I rolled up the sleeves and tied up the bottom.","Got several compliments at brunch!"
"vacation","Great dress for a fun night out with friends.","The waist is a tad small but not very noticeable.","Would rent again."
"vacation","No cons, this dress is GORGEOUS.","I took it to Newport Beach to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary.","It was perfect!!!","First time RTR user and I was very pleased.","I had one small issue with the In Reverse Pearls which I rented to pair with the dress.","One was broken (internally - the locking mechanism).","RTR customer service handled it beautifully and I will definitely be a returning customer.","Love this dress, love this concept!!","Also, the new travel satchel is beautiful and elegant.","Cheers!"
"vacation","I rented this for a tropical vacation in Belize.","It was perfect for day and night and fits true to size.","The fabric is thick enough to create structure but is still informal enough to be resort wear.","I ended up buying the dress."
"vacation","This dress flows beautifully when you walk.","This color has been everywhere this season and I fell in love with it as soon as I put it on.","The fabric feel and cut feel expensive and well made."
"vacation","Loved this dress!","was a bit snug though the hips, but the waistline was very flattering.","Thankfully there is a small snap at the bust to make sure the top stays in place.","Would definitely suggest sizing up for anyone with a B cup or larger.","The color and quality were beautiful!"
"vacation","I wore this dress for my birthday in Vegas and it looked fantastic.","Definitely flashy, which is what I was going for.","The only issue, which I knew from other reviews, is the rubbing of the sequins on my arms.","So if you are planning to dance or walk a lot, this may not be a good fit."
"vacation","Loved everything about this - need to purchase!"
"vacation","I wore this to my Brothers wedding rehearsal and LOVED IT!","It was super comfortable.","It did run a tad bit large and was long, but I wore 4 wedges with it so it sat perfectly on the floor.","Sorry, I do not have pictures :( The sleeves stayed put and I had plenty of room to eat and drink wine and didnt feel like it showed!","I would rent this dress again!","//  I am 54 and weigh around 140 lbs."
"wedding","Loved the dress.","Stretchy, quality fabric.","Flattering, not too tight.","Wore regular racerback bra.","And most importantly, easy to dance in!"
"wedding","Fit really great and had a nice allusion with the lace.","it bordered a little short for me but only bc it was my bosses wedding and I wanted a little more of a conservative length.","Overall really cute!"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a wedding; when it arrived I gasped when I saw the color and lace in person!","It is a beautiful, eye-catching dress.","It was just slightly too big for me in the waist area; if it came in a size 0, that probably would have fit me better.","However, I wore it anyway because I loved the teal color and lace details!","Guests were coming up to me all night to ask where I got it.","I was really sad to mail it back!"
"wedding","I love Elizabeth and James esp their sheath dresses.","They are so flattering and comfortable and the fabric and colors are always so high quality.","I love the neckline on this and the color is so BRIGHT!","Such a fun pink for a outdoor San Diego wedding.","Lots of compliments!","I recommend a strapless bra because the arm holes come in a bit."
"wedding","I ordered a 0 and 2 and ended up going with the 2.","Im normally a 0, but for a wedding that size seemed too short/tight and the 2 gave me room to dance/sit/just feel more comfortable.","Its a beautiful dress and makes you feel very sexy and romantic!","I wore the red, which is bright and makes a statement!","I saw someone who was wearing the navy, which is also very pretty."
"wedding","This dress was a huge winner.","It fit perfectly, I have a curvy build and it accentuated in all the right places but was SO comfortable.","The color is way more vibrant in real life, tons of compliments.","The lace coverage was great for the conservation church wedding as well.","Fit completely true to size.","I ordered a size up based on some of the reviews but the 4 was perfect, it actually seemed to stretch out a little over the course of the night."
"wedding","I loved this dress, I thought the 0 was a bit too tight (it felt like I couldnt really move my legs too much or sit down very comfortably), but the 2 fit perfectly.","It was really comfortable, a great length (may be too short on someone taller than me though - Im about 51) and a really fun pattern.","I got a bunch of compliments on the dress and felt really great in it."
"wedding","This dress was great!","The top is cotton and has just enough stretch that you can be comfortable.","Pockets in a dress are always a great feature!","The full skirt can make you look a little hippie so if you have hips this may not be the dress for you.","The two clips were a little tricky to close on your own, I clipped the back on and stepped through it."
"wedding","I really loved wearing this dress...it was fun and looked really great on.","I especially loved the pockets it has.","The down side is that it looks awful in photos if the angle is anything but for the front.","It makes your backside look really huge but other than that it was perfect."
"wedding","Fits true to size, I am 52 and usually wear a 4; and the 4R was perfect."
"wedding","This fit well- I would say that it was a little small.","I thought that I would be a two and was actually a zero!"
"wedding","Overall, this was a great dress!!","I rented the 2 and the 4 and ended up wearing the 2 because the 4 was little more boxy looking on me.","I received tons of compliments and I could dance in it which was very important.","I will say that it is very very short so please keep that in mind."
"wedding","I think this dress fit exactly the way it was supposed to.","The 8 was not available and since I have breasts on the larger side, the 6 was hard to zip, but it made it.","My only issue was that the zipper wasnt the greatest quality.","Otherwise this dress was amazing and fun!"
"wedding","This dress fit really well on me - comfortably snug up top, flattering waistline cut for a more hourglass shape.","The pictures make this dress look like it will be mint green - its definitely a much bolder apple green.","I still wore it and got a ton of compliments!"
"wedding","This dress is stunning.","I wore it to a black tie wedding and it couldnt have been more perfect.","I received tons of compliments all night long.","If you are curvy on the bottom, this is the perfect dress.","It hugs your rib cage and accentuates your waist.","I did end up not wearing a bra because it made the top a little tight.","I opted to wear statement earrings and black strappy sandals as I wanted to dress to be the stand out.","The length was great in heels for me (55).","Highly recommend this dress!","!"
"wedding","Fabric was beautiful and super light perfect for a summer event"
"wedding","I believe other reviews mentioned the hard-to-get-up zipper.","And its true - but as long as youre prepared for that (and careful zipping it up with assistance), theres not a thing wrong with this dress.","Mint color is gorgeous, style is flattering - you will feel like a red-carpet celebrity.","So unique - I LOVED it!"
"wedding","This dress fit like a glove and I got so many compliments all night!","In the picture on the website I NEVER would have picked it, because it looks kind of plain or ill-fitting.","But I went to the store in NY and tried on a lot of dresses, and when I came out in this one my husbands jaw hit the floor.","A gorgeous dress that fit perfectly and made me feel like a movie star.","Also, super comfortable."
"wedding","Slimming dress, stretchy, and so unique and delicate.","The detail is so stunning and you can t really tell in photos.","Both men and women loved this dress.","It is a bit more pink than red but the color was stunning.","I really cant get over the lace on this and it was a perfect dress to dance in as well.","Breathed easy.","Felt great and sophisticated in this and definitely recommend for a fall/winter affair.","Paired with nude pumps and gold jewelry."
"wedding","Snug in the waist, ribs are other reviewers noted.","I have a pretty small ribcage though, so it was still comfortable.","I wear generally a 32A, and this dress + a sticky bra made me look like I had some cleavage!",":) Also, its not just a flower print on the dress - its actually some embroidery.","Just beautiful.","Perfect skirt for twirling on the dance floor...my husband loved that!","I would rent again for sure."
"wedding","Expect to use a lot of fashion tape.","There was plenty of cleavage, I was a bit nervous when dancing."
"wedding","Runs on the smaller side in the hips/bottom area, so ended up wearing the 6 instead of 4.","The material is great - very thick with minimal stretch so does not require Spanx or a bra.","Overall was a great dress that I would definitely recommend and rent again!"
"wedding","The fit on the bust/shoulders seemed a little tight, but its better described as snug.","The fabric/material is just stretch enough for comfort, and worked great for lots of dancing.","Very comfortable fit in that sense.","I wore a 2 and Im normally a 2, but it does run a little small.","Id say anyone with more than 34B might find this too tight up top."
"wedding","Loved everything about the fit and structure of this dress.","It sits pretty perfectly on the natural waist line to draw attention there, while being flattering and forgiving to all other areas with the A-line plus I was able to wear a regular bra - always a win!","Im 59 and the underlay hit me a couple of inches above the knee which was perfect when standing though if you are a Spanx-wearer like me, you may have to hike them up a bit so they dont show while youre seated.","Loved the pretty detail of the overlay.","Beautiful dress for a semi-formal summer wedding!"
"wedding","Dress was a perfect fit.","I am typically a 2-4 and wore the 2 comfortably.","The 4 was a little big in the bust/waist for me.","When I first put the dress on the lace on the arms felt a little snug but after about 5 minutes I did not feel constricted."
"wedding","This dress was absolutely perfect for a summer wedding!","The color was so bright and fun.","In the pics, it looks a little peachy or orangy, but it is definitely hot pink/light pink in person.","If you have a larger bust, it may be a little tight on top, but the overall fit is still true to size.","LOVED IT!","P.S.","I didnt wear a bra or anything, not necessary!"
"wedding","I am 57 and 148lbs.","I have curvy hips, long legs and NEVER wear tight dresses.","I gave this one a go and was very pleased.","I always buy Long in pants so I was surprised at the extra length this dress had, even with 4 stilettos on it was a bit long.","As you can see, it fit well and it looked super cute paired with a vintage fur vest that kept me warm outside.","Note that the arm length barely hit my wrists, so at certain points I just pushed up the arms to be more comfortable.","The only downside of the dress was due to weather.","It was raining all day so from walking around outside, the bottom of the dress gathered a ton of water weight.","It was heavy and the fabric didnt allow drying, even after being inside for hours.","After a few drinks though, I forgot about the weight, so no biggie!","All in all, I had a great experience!"
"wedding","The dress fit lovely.","I am typically a size between 6 and 8, so I ordered both.","I ended up wearing the size 8.","The dress was perfect!","I wore it as my wedding gown.","The dress looks fabulous in photos and I got tons and tons of compliments.","My only concern was the chest area.","I am small up top and if I slouched the dress top kind of hung there.","I think it would have been better if I had worn the size 6.","But I absolutely loved it."
"wedding","I wore this for my wedding reception and it was perfect!","My family kept saying I looked like I belonged on a red carpet in Hollywood.","The 10L fit me perfectly and made me feel sleek, sexy and very elegant.","It was also very comfortable!","I am 57 and wore 5 heels with it and the Long was the perfect length.","It was so easy ordering from RTR!","I would recommend this dress to anyone that is looking for a classy look!"
"wedding","This dress was an overall knockout!","It runs large like everyone else on here said.","I also found that I could not wear Spanx or a bra because the Spanx I have are high-waisted and would be seen through the mesh.","The area between the boobs is also just mesh, which is sexy yet sophisticated but a strapless bra would have been seen.","So if youre prepared to bare it all underneath, this dress is one hot item.","Length was perfect for me in 4-inch heels.","I would definitely rent again for a winter formal event."
"wedding","While the dress came late, arrived 1.5 hours before the event instead night before, I was very happy with the fit and color of the dress.","The 8 was a little baggy in the waist,  I wore the 6 which was a bit tight across back of shoulders.","I received many compliments on dress throughout the evening.","The dress was comfortable and beautiful, very happy with the dress."
"wedding","This dress was sent as a backup for a wedding.","I was wary about the cut with the back being so exposed and not being able to wear a bra.","However, I received many compliments and was very comfortable in the dress.","The open back ended up being wonderful in the heat.","The top was a bit snug for me but that worked well since I could not wear a bra.","The bottom skirt portion was a tad big but it was not noticeable to others."
"wedding","Loved this dress!","Fun & colorful!","Great material and perfect for a wedding.","Easy to move around and dance in too.","Very pleased with this choice!","Thanks again RTR!"
"wedding","This was my first rental with RTR.","This dress was beautiful, flattering, and very comfortable.","I loved that you could wear the dress as an off the shoulder cap sleeve or up on your shoulder.","I wore the dress with nude heels.","I wish I could have kept it!","The only minor critique would be about the back- it had excess space and although it did not affect the fit, I had one person come up to me and try to adjust it.","Otherwise this dress is gorgeous."
"wedding","This dress was very flattering."
"wedding","runs large, hit just above knee- looked great!"
"wedding","Dress fit perfectly.","It was fitted through the entire body to the hips and was super slimming.","I got so many compliments on how I looked in it and the dress in particular.","Totally a winner choice for me!","!"
"wedding","I am so glad I chose this dress for the wedding I recently attended.","Although I would consider the dress true to size, I ended up wearing my bigger, backup size because I felt a little more comfortable with the bit of extra length.","The dress looks almost sparkly to me in the stock photo but I did note in the reviews that the dress could be on the more casual side depending on how you accessorize.","It definitely wasnt sparkly in person but I prepared for that with glittery jewelry and it still seemed very appropriate for the dressier wedding.","I have been so happy with every RTR experience and I will be renting again soon!"
"wedding","It was the perfect dress.","Im 59 so I think it might be a little long on someone shorter.","Normally dresses are too short for me, so I definitely appreciated the extra length!","!"
"wedding","none"
"wedding","I wore this dress as a wedding guest and received several compliments.","The silhouette is very classy and great for a formal occasion.","Im taking a star away because while I liked the material of the top (it was stretchy and had some give), the blue skirt portion is made of a cheaper-looking material (although not noticeable from a distance).","Additionally, the waistband is not sewn to the skirt (it is only attached to the waist at the sides), so the front of the band would shift around throughout the evening and I had to keep adjusting it to make sure it stayed centered between the top and the skirt.","As for the length, Im 51 and the back did drag a bit on the floor (I wore 3 heels) and it was occasionally stepped on by people walking right behind me, but the higher cut front made it easy for me to walk around in the dress.","Seems to fit true to size; sized up only because my usual size wasnt available."
"wedding","Fit fabulously & focus for once was not on my 40DDD chest.","Tons of compliments from wedding guests of all ages & such a confidence booster :)"
"wedding","I adored wearing this dress so much, I didnt want to take it off!","I got non-stop compliments all night long & had so much fun dancing in it.","The dress is very comfortable and easy to wear, not a ton of accessories are needed because of the great floral lace texture and detail of the dress.","I didnt have to wear a bra with it either, since the straps can be tied to pull it up and keep you in (might be good to wear some sort of petal though).","My ONLY complaint would have to be the lining - the bottom was thick and itchy and kept riding up."
"wedding","Very comfortable, the top is stretchy and fits perfectly.","This also has pockets which is one of my favorite things."
"wedding","Wore it with burnt orange suede pumps, very cute."
"wedding","I loved the color of this dress.","It is hard to tell in pictures because sometimes it looks different, but it is a bright neon pink.","It is perfect for a summer event.","I got so many compliments and it fit really well.","I actually just bought this dress in the blue for a wedding coming up next month.","The length is perfect, not to short, or too long- and the side holes are cute, but not too revealing or risque."
"wedding","Loooooved this rental.","The dress was made well and the color was gorgeous.","I am curvy so dresses tend to be a little shorter on me which is why I went with the 12.","The sleeves were a little tight on the 12, but the Sz 10 were actually stretched out already.","I loved it so much and my mom is going to rent it next month!"
"wedding","The dress was classy but sexy, and I got a ton of compliments!","The only issue was the side zipper was a little tough to get up, but once you got it the dress fit great.","Highly recommended!"
"wedding","The fit was great!","It was very comfortable and I love the pockets!"
"wedding","I loved this dress but unfortunately couldnt wear it.","While the past reviews are spot on, the fabric is super thin and shows EVERYTHING, that was not my biggest problem.","Im only 411 so even with my highest heels, this dress was still too long for me.","I tried to show the extra length in the second picture I uploaded.","If I were about 5 inches taller this dress would have definitely been for me!"
"wedding","I received so many compliments wearing this dress to an outdoor DC wedding.","The color is a showstopper.","Its such a hard color to describe since it looked different colors in different lights.","So inside while getting ready, it was more of an olive green/mustard yellow.","Then out in the sunshine, it was more of a goldenrod yellow/hint of green.","Awesome color that you can pair with any color accessories (I went with navy accessories, and nude/gold shoes).","Very comfortable, even in the 95 degree heat/humidity of DC in August.","The beading and detail is amazing.","The sheer section on top is very sheer, so youll have to wear a strapless bra.","I tried the see-through bra straps and you could still see them.","The cap sleeves were a little annoying since you couldnt move as well, but they were still comfortable.","Definitely not a dress you could wear to a reception, as there was no give in it at all.","Overall, a wonderful dress for any occasion."
"wedding","I rented both the xs and sm both fit almost identical!","I ended up wearing the xs because the hem on the sm was just not laying right!","I paired this dress with all rose gold accessories and received complements on how beautiful my dress was!","This dress was so comfortable, elegant and did not make me hot at all with all the dancing I did"
"wedding","fitted in all the right places"
"wedding","This dress was a hit!","I loved everything about it!","I received so many compliments on it.","Before I chose it I was a little weary about renting it for a wedding, but it turned out perfect!","I decided to pair it with lace up booties and dark lipstick to give it sort of an edgy look.","Such a fun rental!","The grandma of the groom could not get over the dress and kept saying if she were my age and looked like me she would have picked the same thing.","The overall fit is great besides the waist area... it is really baggy so you just have to be conscious about that when posing for pictures, especially if its from the side.","I have legs and a butt so it hugged my curves in that way.","Overall, baggy in the waist but everything else is perfect!"
"wedding","This was a last minute backup option that I had over-nighted when my original option didnt work out.","I knew this dress was a sure-thing as I had already rented it in white a few months prior.","This color was a knockout and the fit was perfect."
"wedding","What a great dress!","I got so many compliments!","I typically wear a 4 and the 4L did fit, but the semi stretchy fabric clung to curves and bumps.","The 6L was a much better fit and gave a much more slim and smooth appearance.","I did wear a regular plunge cut bra, however I used two pieces of fashion tape to secure the dress at the bust line and had no issues.","I also wore shapewear that came to mind thigh, and I had no issues with it showing through the spot in the dress.","I would rent this again with no hesitation."
"wedding","I was super impressed by the dress as soon as I put it on.","I couldnt stop looking at the birds and flowers and pointing them out to everyone who saw me try it on.","The neck area could irritate a bit, so I rubbed on some anti-chaffing stick.","The chest area is very flattering as the shape eliminates side boobs.","I usually wear a 0 or 2, and ended up wearing size 0 to the wedding.","The dress falls to knee length for me, my fiance, parents, cousins, relatives, and strangers all complimented on the dress.","You look hot.","This dress is suitable for you.","I really like this dress... you rented it?","You should definitely buy it.","I felt great in teh dress & would definitely rent again."
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress it looks so nice on and it was a show stopper.","Everyone loved it.","I wore a size 2 but I wouldve preferred a size 4 as it was tighter then I hope it would be area my ribs."
"wedding","I wore this dress to my friends wedding rehearsal and dinner.","The dress is very tight but completely covered.","I felt sexy but did not feel inappropriately dressed for the event.","The dress is tight but it stretches a lot.","I would recommend you size up because of the slit.","I am a 32DD and had no issue wearing a strapless bra.","This dress is a showstopper.","I highly recommend renting it."
"wedding","I loved this dress, but didnt love it on me that much (because I just had a baby- so the extra weight was a horrible look in my opinion).","Id say if you are concerned about your stomach area, this isnt the dress to rent.","It is very beautiful, colorful, & fit great.","I received a lot of compliments on the dress all night.","For shoes, I lucked up and bought a pair last year which matched this dress perfectly."
"wedding","This dress was lovely.","It was also very comfortable.","It was just a little big for me but a narrow belt around the waist helped a lot.","The fabric was a little lighter than I expected, but that allowed it to drape and flow."
"wedding","As the other reviews said, the sequins do scratch your arms.","The length is great for those of us with long legs but I think it would hit at an odd place on a shorter girl.","Overall, the dress was amazing!","Just rent it, youll be glad you did!"
"wedding","This dress fit beautifully and I got so many compliments on it!","The fabric is stretchy and form fitting but the lace makes it a little more forgivable.","For me there wasnt a huge difference in fit between the 6 and 8, but I have a bigger bust so I went with the 8 because it was a little less snug around the top.","The dress is long!!","I know Im short (hence the joke in the picture lol), but I wore tall heels and the dress still was just a tiny bit too long so I had to make sure to hold it up a bit when I walked.","Also the lace straps were a little too loose, so at times I had to hoist up the top a bit, some fashion tape could probably fix that problem though.","All in all I loved this dress and everyone who saw it told me how fantastic it looked.","Thanks RTR!","!"
"wedding","I wore the Large, even though the Medium fit, I think they forgot some of us have a bigger top half.","I could zip the Medium, but with any sudden movements my chest would have been someones dinner!","I felt more comfortable in the larger size, even though it was a little too big, it was still fit!","I really enjoyed the fabric, it was not itchy, uncomfortable or anything that we all hate.","The slits with the mesh on the side gave it a sexy yet refined look!","This is definitely a perfect LBD!"
"wedding","Overall I was in love with this dress and would definitely consider renting it again!!","This is my second experience with rent the runway and Ive been very happy both times with my dresses.","I ordered the 0 and the 2 and ended up wearing the 2.","The 0 fit perfectly all-around and would have been just right for a night out for a bachelorette or NYE event, etc, but was a little short for a wedding, which is why I went with the 2.","Since the back was open it felt a little loose on top, but I didnt have any issues with it falling off my shoulders (I suggest dress tape, I just didnt have any).","The sparkle on the dress was beautiful and it was very comfortable to dance around in all night!","I got a lot of compliments throughout the night and felt great wearing it!","I highly recommend this dress :)"
"wedding","Im 56, 120 lb, and the 2R fit perfectly.","It was extremely comfortable and I loved the low back.","My chest is 36B and the top provided enough support that it wasnt a problem without a bra.","My only con is that I like to wear at least 2 inch heels and the dress almost wasnt long enough.","It fit my height perfectly at 56, so if you are taller at all then you should order the L version.","Or if you want to wear big heels at 55 or 56 then you should even try the L."
"wedding","This dress was way too big for me.","The length was excellent.","If a 14 had been available, I would have tried that size."
"wedding"," I usually vary between 2 & 4.","I was nervous since clothes fit me a little different post-baby, but this size 4 was perfect!","A very nice length for a catholic wedding, comfortable to dance in all night and loved the color and raw lace edges.","Got lots of compliments!"
"wedding","Dress fit true to size.","The material is on the thicker, heavier side.","Very comfortable to wear and the pockets are a great bonus.","I felt a bit like a princess, as it is a little poofy, and it was perfect for the black tie optional wedding."
"wedding","Cute and comfortable dress that has a very flattering fit."
"wedding","I love this dress!!","The color was gorgeous and the fit was sexy but elegant.","I thought this ran pretty true to size.","The 0R was a bit long for me at 51 but not terrible.","I had also rented a 2P but it was pretty large and the ruching gave me the appearance of a flabby belly.","Id recommend ordering your true size and sizing down for a back up.","The ruching on the 0R hide any imperfections and accentuated my hourglass shape.","The back is open but the high neckline balances out how much skin you show.","There is a built in shelf bra but there isnt any padding.","I ended up going braless due to lack of time to purchase a backless bra and it was fine but it would have been nice to have a little extra support and some padding.","Again, not a deal breaker but if you rent this dress (which you definitely should!)","Id recommend purchasing/using a backless, slightly padded bra - especially in colder months.","I love this dress & will probably rent again!"
"wedding","Love the fit!","It was a bit loose so it left some room for my 8 month pregnant belly (I did size up to plan for this accommodation though).","Very comfortable and numerous compliments.","I would definitely wear this dress again."
"wedding","Loved the fit, very flattering!!","Comfortable to wear.","Positioning of the cut-out made it fun and interesting while the length of the dress kept it sophisticated and appropriate.","Got many compliments & I loved the color!"
"wedding","The dress is awesome!","The only complaint I had was its very hard to zipper and I wish I had bigger boobs.","Yes, you need a chest for this dress.","I wore a nu-bra and pads to enhance me.","Runs kinda small thru the hips also.","Loved it!","!"
"wedding","Want this for my wardrobe!","This dress was a thicker material.","Fit snug in the hips & thighs, baggier on top, creating a dolman sleeve type top.","Wore for a rehearsal dinner with nude shoes."
"wedding",":)"
"wedding","This dress is beautiful!","It fit me great except the top was a little big, and Im fairly busty (C cup).","But I just pinned it and it was fine.","I got a lot of compliments!","It was super comfortable!"
"wedding","This dress blew away my expectations.","The lace is gorgeous in person and I received so many compliments.","I was nervous about the bra situation, but I didnt need one.","The dress, specifically the bust, is so well made it gives you great shape and support without smashing your chest.","The dress was a bit longer on me than it is on the model, but it was still a flattering length.","I would rent this dress again in a heartbeat!"
"wedding","The waist is snug but it didnt bother me much throughout the night.","I got so many compliments and I loved it.","The fabric is thick which makes all the stitching at the waist minorly irritating if your moving a lot.","It was perfect and airy for this summer wedding.","LOVE LOVE the length.","Im glad I read reviews and bought a small slip on Amazon.","It was very much needed.","You could tell if you were looking for it, but I dont think anyone did.","I am usually a 6.","So happy about this one.","Photo wouldnt load."
"wedding","Loved this dress so much!","I have wider shoulders than hips, so not every dress works on me.","This dress was extremely flattering and created the illusion of curves, though.","I felt so confident and comfortable in it, and received compliments all night!","The dress did not fall down, even when I was dancing up a storm.","It is so well-made and the lining did not show how sweaty I got in a 100 degree ceremony under the sun (very grateful for this).","A warning — the dress runs small so I had to size up, and the 4R was a little too long even in 3 heels, and was a tad loose on the hips.","That aside, highly recommend and I wish I could have kept it!","I rented a House of Harlow necklace to go with it."
"wedding","The dress was beautiful quality, not a single snag anywhere.","However, the entire dress AND sleeves are lined with a thick, satin-like material.","The skirt has 4 separate layers!","Not for warmer weather at all, and the arms/chest are very tight.","I am broad-shouldered but do not have a large bust, and this was very difficult to move my arms and be comfortable in.","I would only suggest this if you have smaller arms & shoulders.","Otherwise, it was a beautiful color & quality, and the material itself was soft and comfortable."
"wedding","This dress fit great and I liked the length.","I had a baby 9 months ago and I felt like this dress was flattering on me.","I wore a nude color heal which went perfectly fine with it.","I wore a gold statement necklace which complimented it well.","I received many compliments and I am so happy I choose this dress."
"wedding","Loved the dress, it was perfect for a black tie wedding.","The dress fit great everywhere accept the top which ran a little big on the straps.","I used a safety pin to help tighten a bit."
"wedding","Stretchy and great for dancing!"
"wedding","Color is amazing!","Fabric is heavy like living room curtains so I was hot during the beach wedding ceremony but really comfortable dancing outside as the night grew colder.","Hips hit a little high on me (and Ive never had that in a dress before) and it could raise my arms past my shoulders.","Paired it with bylizlaw.com earrings that matched the swirly pattern.","Got tons of compliments."
"wedding","The top is great, however there is no give in the darting near your bust.","It is heavy fabric that is gorgeous with the detailing and colors.","The bottom of the dress is stretchy and made of a damask type fabric.","Great for women will full hips."
"wedding","Def a little snug in the arms but I preferred that for this lace sheath overlay and lace arms.","I am busty and I still found the 4 to be true to size.","If you are extremely busty and or just like extra arm room, size up.","Beautiful dress!"
"wedding","i opted to not wear this dress because it ran too large.","also the length of the long was entirely way too long for my height even in 5 inch heels.","57 should be able to wear the regular without any issues"
"wedding","I usually wear a size 4 but my shoulders are broad and my hips are wide.","The cut was tight around my chest on the top and scrunched way too much under my hips at the bottom.","The 6 fit well enough and gave me a little more room to dance!","It still scrunched at the bottom so I would need to readjust before photos, but overall this dress was very flattering in style and absolutely love the vibrant color!","Sidenote: my boyfriend did consider changing out of his uniform and he bought a cobalt pocket square and tie to match me for his grey suit, the dress is definitely royal blue not cobalt."
"wedding","Felt great in the dress, very comfortable.","Im short, so it was a little long.","Shoulders kept riding up, but it wasnt a huge problem."
"wedding","Fit is very big.","Size down one or two sizes.","Strapless, backless bra worked best for me."
"wedding","The dress fits perfectly.","Ive never had so many compliments on a dress.","And it was incredibly comfortable!","Im in love.","I wish I had gotten better pictures to showcase the asymmetrical cut.","I have never been one to wear dresses, let alone feel comfortable in one.","You will not regret wearing this dress!"
"wedding","Absolutely beautiful!","Amazing fit!","Was complemented all night!"
"wedding","Id normally order a 0 and a 2 but based on other reviews, I opted for a 2 and a 4.","Didnt even try on the 4, as the 2 was a perfect fit.","Was able to wear with just sticky bra cups since the top was comfortably snug, but not tight, and the opening in the back would have shown anything else.","Length hit just above my knee, and fabric was thick without being heavy.","Pockets added a playful touch.","Felt glamorous all night and never had to worry about readjusting all night despite dancing for hours.","Would highly recommend."
"wedding","I wore this for a wedding reception.","It was perfect!","However, please note that if you are like me when it comes to dresses and do not like your armpit to be smothered or have clothes to tight underneath--you will need to go up a size in the dress.","I am usually a size 4 but wore the 6."
"wedding","Scratches under arms"
"wedding","I loved this romper.","It fit perfectly and was extremely comfortable.","The bright red color is amazing, and the lace made it feel dressy enough to wear to a wedding.","The back is sheer lace so I chose to go bra-less, but it was form fitting enough to be okay.","Overall great romper - I highly recommend!"
"wedding","The fit was form fitting but the material was thick and forgiving.","You can wear spanx but you dont necessarily need them!","The length was perfect for 3inch heels, it just skimmed the ground.","Got tons of compliments and felt amazing all night!"
"wedding","I usually wear a 2 or 4 but this was difficult to zip up."
"wedding","Comfy, airy, and playful.","Runs large and would have been more flattering with a belt but I still loved it!"
"wedding","I love this dress!","It runs large as I normally wear a 4 and I ended up wearing the 2 because it was more flattering in my waist area.","Its very comfortable, classy, and sexy.","I would rent again in another color!"
"wedding","Back is opaque.","very comfortable and pretty."
"wedding","It is sparkly and flattering."
"wedding","This dress was AMAZING.","It fit very nicely.","I wore the medium but I could also fit into the small.","The medium was a bit more comfortable as the small was a little more snug-- though they both looked similar when worn.","Im typically a solid 6 and have an hourglass shape.","I felt this dress accentuated all of the right areas.","I wore the shoulder straps lower, I will say the shoulder straps on the small stayed in place better, but the medium was sufficient.","I did have to adjust a few times during the night, but nothing major.","Over all, this was an awesome choice!"
"wedding","Usually a size 4 (58, 130lbs) but wore the 2R for the event, which fit perfectly through the bust and hips but was a bit tight in the underarms.","Got so many compliments on this dress.","Classy and comfortable.","Would definitely recommend it!"
"wedding","All things considered - my height & weight as compared to my 36 bra band - the LelaRose Monet Garden Dress fit very true to size.","It hit me at the narrow part of the leg just under the knee and I thought it was a flattering & demure length; of course, you could shorten it w/hem tape if you prefer.","There are terrific little bra strap holders and I taped the neckline of the dress to my bra - my normal everyday bra - so it wouldnt show if  I leaned forward.","Perfect.","The colors shown are accurate.","I reached a little beyond my comfort zone and, for a noon wedding luncheon at a restaurant, I was perfectly dressed.","I wore it with smashing purple suede pumps - the black in the dress is not quite black enough to match with other blacks - and the Ella Carter Kai earrings; a fine wool crepe blazer took care of the chill and it worked nicely with the ruched sheath.","I gave the dress only four stars because it was a bit frayed around the cap sleeves - loved the cap sleeves - and there were lots of long threads.","Needless to say, thanks again to the two brilliant women who created RTR, so we can all dress and feel like a million bucks!"
"wedding","Dress runs short and small.","Very elegant and great for a black tie event.","I was worried the sequins would look cheap in person, but that was not an issue at all.","I would have been happy if I had just ordered a size larger than my usual size."
"wedding","After reading reviews about the fit of the top, I was really nervous that I didnt order the right size since I have big boobs.","However, the 4 fit pretty well with some adjusting from the bottom.","The top was snug and stayed in place, the boning was helpful but I didnt find that it dug into me at all.","The length was perfect with 5 heels and the color really popped!","I didnt find the fabric to be too thick as some reviews had mentioned, which was appreciated.","I loved wearing this dress and the pockets were especially helpful.","Overall, this dress was a huge hit."
"wedding","I usually wear a size 6, but I found the 4 fit me better.","It was comfortable, and I could move in it easily.","The sequins became slightly scratchy after dancing.","This may not be the case if the sleeves fit my arms a little more snug, and had I not been dancing for a long period of time.","I 100% recommend this dress as well as Rent the Runway for their superb customer service when one of the bridesmaids needed a new size overnight-ed."
"wedding","Fits fairly true to size.Im usually a 10/12 and wore an xl for added comfort."
"wedding","Work this for a black tie wedding in Florida.","The color was perfect and the dress fit better than I could have expected."
"wedding","Pretty true to size--just a bit too big, especially in the chest area."
"wedding","I wore this dress for my wedding reception.","I absolutely loved this dress.","I received SO many compliments.","My husband loved it on me.","I rented the size 0 and 2.","Both dresses fit just fine, but I went with the 2 because the 0 was just a tad too short (I didnt want my ass hanging out).","Its my favorite RTR dress, hands down.","If I could buy it, I would in a heartbeat!","I love this dress so much, Im renting it again for my brothers wedding."
"wedding","Both size 10 and 12 fit however I went with the larger size so that I can move around comfortably.","Great color.","the cutout was in the perfect place, it was just sexy enough."
"wedding","Id been looking for a reason to rent this dress for a while and grabbed my chance for a wedding.","The color and cut were good.","The 10 would have fit, but I decided that the skirt hung a little better in the bigger size.","And since I decided to go with a bra, the girls were at full attention and the 12 seemed to be a better bet.","At some point (right after I walked into the wedding) I got very self-conscious that I was showing so much cleavage, which isnt like me.","I was worried that I looked trashy.","I chalk all that up to a conversation with my mother about another dress that I wore recently and her judgement because I got nothing but compliments all night.","I stopped counting after the 6th or 7th person stopped me at cocktail hour.",":)"
"wedding","Im usually a size for but can swing a size 2 as well.","Went with the smaller size because since there is so much material on this dress and Im glad I did.","Loved it; its so beautiful and was sad to have to give it back."
"wedding","Beautiful, heavy fabric.","I have very wide shoulders so the top was pretty snug and I had to forgo a bra, which was fine for me and made the fit more comfortable."
"wedding","I really felt pretty in this dress.","The only qualm I had was that the lining was uneven on one side.","Im glad I went up a size because the 8 was a little too snug for comfort, and the 10 added length.","I wore this for a wedding shower and I received endless compliments."
"wedding","Loved this dress.","The color is amazing.","It fit like a glove."
"wedding","This dress fit great and is a stand out.","Conservative neckline with great sleeve and leg length for a winter wedding.","Unique patter and great fluid movement."
"wedding","I wore this for a rehearsal dinner in a Northern Woods weddings, which fit perfectly with the rustic style.","The fit, overall, was right on.","My only complaint was that the slip (built in) was too short and rode up when sitting down for dinner."
"wedding","The color is really like a jewel blue but it depends on the lighting, I wore gold shoes and a statement necklace to dress it up more.","The 12 fit perfectly and had nice room in the hips (my problem area).","The fabric was of good quality but not stretchy, which I was happy about."
"wedding","This dress is just a bright and beautiful in person as it is in the picture.","There is a nice layer of padding across the chest so you dont have to wear a bra.","The only negative about this dress, which most people have said before, is the arms are a bit restricting while dancing, etc.","This is not the end of the world though.","I still danced and had a great time and felt great while doing so."
"wedding","The dress was not only flattering, but comfortable throughout the night.","Got lots of compliments!"
"wedding","I received this dress overnight after renting another which did not work for me.","Fortunately, having rented Badgley Mischka dresses of this style previously, I knew it would work!","Because the dress comes in a bit at the straps, I wore a racerback in lieu of a regular-strap bra.","Im 56 and wore the 8R with 2 heels and it worked fine.","Ive also worn before with flats and while I had a bit more drag to the dress behind me, I didnt see my shoes every time I took a step.","Overall, this dress is super classy and great for a formal affair!"
"wedding","As a newbie to RTR, I was slightly skeptical.","But THIS dress truly exceeded my expectations and I received tons of compliments.","TONS!","Not only that, but the fit was very flattering(especially for us curvy girls) so you can dance, twirl, and eat that extra piece of cake til your hearts content.","The skirt isnt sheer enough to be see through or tight but if you have a slight tummy, I would suggest some sort of shapewear.","I will for sure rent from RTR again and was so sad to send this Beautiful dress back!","Do it ladies - thank me later!","Pros:-very flattering fit-beautiful color-nice sweetheart like neckline - I suggest warning minimal to no jewelry on the neck and Just accent with earrings and/or bracelet.","-nice and secure around the waist and not see through in the skirt Cons:-the straps - I had the size 12 and 10 and the size 12 had slightly more room in the waist but the 10 was more secure in the should strap area and chest.","So I ended up with the smaller size and just wore spanx.","But even with the 10 I was still adjusting the straps more often than Id like.","-the skirt material is bee thin so be careful with beverages while wearing it or if its a slightly cooler/windy day."
"wedding","I loved the dress, couldve sized down to a 6L but only a 6 was available and I was wearing 3.5 inch heels.","The 8L was a loose in the chest area, and a bit loose at my midsection but didnt stop me from wearing it.","Some signs of wear to the dress--stitching was split at the slit so I safety pinned it to not have any more issues, and the neckline had some pilling likely due to someone else wearing a necklace that caught on the fabric.","Nothing that anyone else noticed, but of course it is a rented dress a little wear is to be expected.","Overall loved it, even though the sizing wasnt perfect--really the main reason I didnt give 5 stars.","Definitely recommend it!"
"wedding","Loved it!"
"wedding","Im usually either a 4 or 6 in dresses like these.","Im a little wider in the chest and back area, so even though a 4 fit my body, a 6 fit my chest and back; which in the end was perfect because it gave me wiggle room without being too loose.","The best part was the floral on the bottom.","In the picture, you can only see the front side with floral, but its also in the back.","It was also a thicker material where a bra isnt necessarily needed.","The dress held everything in place.","I definitely recommend it for a special event any time of the year.","Really, navy blue works for any season!"
"wedding","This dress was perfect for the Iowa summer wedding I was an usher in.","The color fit in with the garden at a mansion and it wasnt too flashy where I stuck out.","I received many compliments.","The fit was perfect on the 2 but I received the size two dress with a red wine stain on it.","I ended up wearing the four I ordered as a backup and it was a little loose in the bust (im a B) but it actually allowed more room for eating and dancing.","No one would have noticed it was a tad big.","Id definitely rent again."
"wedding","loose fit - great to hide my baby bump"
"wedding","The dress is not forgiving so if you are insecure about belly/butt I would not recommend.","Gorgeous dress!"
"wedding","The size 4 fit perfectly, so I didnt try on the 6, Im 510 and 140.","It was my first British wedding.","I found a hat that matched perfectly, and accented with red purse and shoes.","Extremely comfortable for an all day event, and fun to dance in.","I got a lot of compliments, and just loved the lace detail.","I didnt want to take it off!"
"wedding","Ordered the size 4P with a 2P as back up.","I always wear a size 4, but the bust was too large in this.","Couldve maybe worn a bra to make it work, but decided to try the 2P instead.","The zipper kept getting stuck and it was definitely tight in the chest, but it was more flattering than the larger size.","The boning under the arm was sticking out when I received, but I didnt notice when I was trying on.","Unfortunately, this scratched under my arm all night and was very uncomfortable.","I couldnt wait to get the dress off, but I received tons of compliments on it."
"wedding","Fit was good overall.","The sequins were a little scratchy under the arms but I soon forgot about them.","I received lots of compliments.","The wedding was outside at dusk and at one time I lit up like a disco ball!","Lots of fun and definitely a stand out dress."
"wedding","Absolutely fell in love with this dress.","I received so many compliments that I didnt want to take it off at the end of the night.","I paired this dress with nude peep toe pumps and rented turquoise kate spade earrings."
"wedding","I got loads of compliments on this dress.","I did have to buy some serious stick on silcone to fill up the top, and that wasnt enough.","The top puckers oddly if you dont have enough bust to fill it out, definitely better for the larger chested set.","Otherwise, lovely, comfortable, really enjoyed wearing it."
"wedding","I wore this to a winter wedding and felt gorgeous!","The fabric is heavy and had just enough sparkle to be dressy and flattering.","Read reviews for the correct sizing, as it is tricky.","The fit is very slim and smushed down my bust a little, but overall I loved the shape and the gorgeous fabric."
"wedding","The 0R was the perfect length with 4 inch heels.","Received many compliments for wedding attendees!"
"wedding","very comfortable and easy to dance in because so stretchy!","Definitely need a bra, as the material flattened me out without one.","I wore 4 inch heels, and the length was perfect on my 53.5 frame.","I danced all night!"
"wedding","I loved how form fitting it was on top, so I didnt necessarily need a bra.","The dress is also sexy yet really classy."
"wedding","Perfect fit, comfortable."
"wedding","The top runs very true to size.","The pockets are the best part; you will feel like a princess in this dress dancing around all night.","It does run long in the back so make sure that your shoes are tall enough if you dont want the dress to be on the floor."
"wedding","I rented both the 6R and 8R and fit into both (the fabric is stretchy and there is give) but the length on the 8R (when paired with 5 inch heels) was just much better.","Overall, the dress fit like a glove, showed off my curves, and was very comfortable and easy to dance in.","I honestly received compliments all night with multiple people asking me where I got the dress.","This was my first RTR experience, but I think Im hooked now!"
"wedding","For those with a bit of  a beer belly, this is super flattering that flares out at just the right area.","Additionally, the fabric is thick, which also adds to the flattering fit.","Would rent again."
"wedding","This dress was not my first option, but the one I rented was damaged.","RTR customer service over nighted me this one.","OMG!","It is stunning in person.","It fit great and has a built-in bra.","Im a 34A and it fit fine in the bust area.","My guess is that a B cup would fit it fine but a C in the size 2 may be a stretch.","The zipper: You may have problems zipping this w/out help.","I found a way around it though by zipping it w/the dress backwards and then turning it around when the zipper was passed the waistline.","Im short and it came right above my quads so if you are tall, look at the model photo to see how short this is.","I wore this to a spring, afternoon wedding and  got so many compliments.","I also felt great in it and was able to move just fine.","I paired it w/gold sandals."
"wedding","As others have mentioned, the dress was SUPER low-cut.","Nothing that wasnt fixed by a strategically placed safety pin.","The straps were also a bit loose, but they never fell down and I never felt uncomfortable.","The dress was very comfortable and light weight.","I had it on from about 4pm-2am and the sparkles didnt irritate under my arms until the very end of the night.","I received so many compliments - I felt like a rock star and a princess.","I was rent this dress again in a heartbeat."
"wedding","I have a small chest/upper body, but a big booty and hip region.","I went for this dress because it seemed like it would accommodate those needs with the stretchy fabric, and I like showing off the shoulders.","It was very flattering, and while it was stretchy, it also held everything in.","And another plus, it was an appropriate length for a girl who is 511!","Thanks RTR, for making me feel beautiful and confident in my own skin."
"wedding","I loved the fit.","For me the size 10 fits like a glove hugging all my curves...which could be good or bad depending on your preference.","I opted to wear the size 12 to give me more room to eat, drink, dance and be merry and comfortable :-)"
"wedding","True to size.","I recommend going a size up if you want a not very form fitting look.","Airy even for a hot summer wedding.","looks good on pale and tanned skin."
"wedding","This was a rushed delivered backup dress after the first dress didnt fit, but I couldnt be more pleased.","I ordered both the 14R and 16R, and although both fit, I ended up wearing the 16R as the 14R was a little tight in the shoulders.","The 16R gave me just a little more room, and I was comfortable for the entire evening, which doesnt happen often.","I was also pleasantly surprised that the length of the dress was perfect with 2.5 heels!","Best of all, I felt beautiful.","I got several compliments and people asking where I got my dress.","Overall, a perfect dress for a wedding!","If I could, I would buy this dress."
"wedding","This fit true-to-size on me and was comfortable to wear.","I loved the lace detail on it and the tulle skirt.","The color was also very flattery.","I ended up pairing it with nude high heels."
"wedding","I loved this dress.","The cut outs are stretchy which makes them super comfortable.","The length was perfect for a wedding, not too short!","I wore the 6 because I felt like the area around the rib cage fit better even though the 4 zipped up just fine, Im so glad I sized up here.","The area in the bust felt a tad big but if I stood up straight it felt a lot better."
"wedding","Figure flattering, i typically wear a 4 or 2 and went with the 2 this time because it fit me perfectly.","Its simple and sophisticated at the same time and i got a lot of compliments on this one!"
"wedding","This dress was super comfortable and photographed beautifully.","Couldnt be happier with my 1st RTR experience.","You have gained a customer for life!","I dont think I will ever buy another dress!","!"
"wedding","Fit was amazing and very flattering.","Ran true to size.","Sexy and classy!"
"wedding","I didnt end up wearing this dress for the wedding.","I received this dress as a backup dress that was picked by the stylist.","I didnt care for it when I pulled it out of the box BUT when I put it on...AMAZING!!!","It was so gorgeous and the slit was just perfect.","I didnt end up wearing it because it was for fitting, had a slit and a little low cut in the front so I didnt want to offend my soon to be sister in law.","This dress is breath taking tho"
"wedding","Fits a little large (and longer than I thought it would be) but I think its supposed to be a bit billow-y.","Super comfy and great for a beach wedding!"
"wedding","This dress was fabulous; the full skirt was so fun to dance in, and I received a ton of compliments.","I read other reviews about it running big so I ordered a size down as my back up but ended up going with my normal size.","The top was a bit gappy on the sides but looked fine on me.","This might be problematic for smaller chested ladies.","The dress was also longer than it looked on the model.","I wore it with slightly wedged sandals and the back almost touched the ground.","Its probably meant to be worn with heels."
"wedding","The longer model had the perfect length for me.","Perfect fit around waist and hips."
"wedding","The dress is beautiful.","I loved the high-low hem and the top was very comfortable and well fitted.","I was not pulling it up all day long, like some strapless styles.","It stayed put.","Actually, the dress was so nice that I had to dress it down with a boring belt."
"wedding","The sleeves and neckline were very fitted, given theyre lace, so I size up in this.","The overall fit was great and so comfortable, but I felt like I need more room up top so I could move and not be worried about pulling the lace.","Super comfortable and I loved the pockets!"
"wedding","Runs true to size"
"wedding","Fit very well - the material is forgiving as it has the right amount of support and the style helped to hide my big belly (ruching in the right places).","Needed 3-inch heels.","Material heavier and worked well for fall, rainy evening wedding ceremony (indoors)."
"wedding","Perfect for garden wedding."
"wedding","Loved the dress !","Im usually an 8 or 10, but ended up wearing a 10 b/c it fit better.","It was comfortable throughout the night with dancing and all!","Someone asked if I got this from RTR b/c theyve seen it on here, which I guess could be considered a con....","Overall Im very pleased with the dress!"
"wedding","Loved the fit of this dress.","I received complements all night and felt great.","It was easy to spend the entire evening in this dress."
"wedding","This dress was perfect for a fall wedding.","Conservative enough to wear around co-workers, and so flattering that Im not sure Ive ever received more compliments on a dress.","Im short, so if I owned this, I would have taken an inch or two off the length.","Also, since the v-neck is not quite deep enough, it was a little tight in the bust, but not enough to be uncomfortable.","The color is beautiful and the pockets are a nice bonus!","I got the 0 and 2, and wore the 0."
"wedding","This is the second wedding that I wore this dress too in the same season (oops)!","I showed a picture of it to the bride of the second wedding (my new SIL) and she absolutely loved the dress for hers so how could I say no!","The dress is super comfortable and I got tons of compliments on it at both weddings."
"wedding","I liked wearing this dress.","Glad I rented both the 2 and the 4, because I needed the 4 for the bust.","Dress was in terrible shape inside - tons of strings everywhere!","Loved the dark navy color and shape of the dress."
"wedding","This dress wasnt very long, so you may need shorter heels depending on how it fits you!"
"wedding","Dress fits great and is comfortable.","Fabric was a little thicker than I was expecting it to be and therefore was a little warm at the summer wedding I wore it too.","The pockets are a nice touch and I received several compliments on this dress."
"wedding","The dress fit like a glove and didnt slip once.","I was able to dance the night away."
"wedding","The fabric is a very unique stretch linen.","The floral pattern is beautiful and fit perfectly for the island wedding.","It was comfortable and very flattering, loved it!"
"wedding","When RtR didnt have my back-up size for my original dress, I was a little disappointed...but since they are awesome at Customer Service, I got to choose another dress...and they surprised me by sending this beautiful number!","I loved everything about this dress.","It fit like a glove and I got compliments all night.","The material is comfortable enough to dance in but was formal enough for a pretty fancy wedding.","The back cut-out gives just a peek of sexy, while the print stuns.","I felt beautiful in this dress!","I didnt end up wearing a nu-bra because I like to live dangerously, but I wasnt self-conscious about the girls all evening.","Dont hestiate--rent this dress!"
"wedding","Loved the dress.","Thick, nice material and great color for a fall/end of summer outdoor wedding.","Could of fit into the 8 but liked the extra room.","I would buy this dress!"
"wedding","I just want to start off saying that this wasnt even my first choice pick.","But after what I originally wanted ran out of my size, I went for this.","And let me tell you, I am so glad I did!","It flows beautifully with its light and airy fabric.","In 4 inch heels (to my 5 foot tall body) the back of the dress only grazed the floor slightly.","It was so fun to dance in and felt great to strut around in.","I received so many compliments from my friends and the staff of the venue.","Between the 0R & 2R I ordered, the 0R for perfectly.","I do t have a big chest (A cup) so I didnt even need to wear a bra (the extra fabric helped to cover any nip slips.)","I would absolutely recommend this dress!"
"wedding","The first thing that surprised me was actually the fabric.","I was expecting something more structured but it was comfortable so I was fine with that.","The 6 fit great in the body and bust but was wayyyy too short, so I went with the 8.","You cant really wear a bra with this so if you have to size up, make sure you have enough shoulders/chest to hold it up.","All in all I loved the dress and got a lot of compliments on it."
"wedding","This dress was a great fit, very flattering for an hour glass body type, and was super comfortable.","I wore it to a destination wedding in Florida and it was perfect for dancing the night away!","The colors are pretty and vibrant - I got many compliments.","The regular length was perfect for me - I wore the dress with wedges and it did not drag on the floor."
"wedding","The bow was an adorable touch.","The dress fit well and was comfortable for a winter wedding!","The colors are even more vivid in person."
"wedding","I loved this dress!!","The color and lace were super pretty.","I was so surprised how comfortable it was, too!","You never know with long sleeved lace, but this dress had plenty of movement and I was very stretchy and comfy.","I wore this to an October Catholic wedding and thought it was perfect!","It was modest, but not too much so.","I was able to dance the night away without every feeling restricted.","The only small issue I had is Im very self-conscious about my tummy, and this wasnt the most flattering for that insecurity (but thats also just the style of the dress!).","However, it was a beautiful dress, Im very glad I rented it, and I would definitely recommend!"
"wedding","It fit well, but its stretchy so could fit someone up to a size 4.","My girlfriend is a size 4, I am a two and it still fit her perfectly.","Love everything about this dress and I felt so glamorous!"
"wedding","Great for any special occasion."
"wedding","This dress received so many compliments.","It was tight in the arms.","The fabric was thick enough it worked for a spring wedding and didnt need a cover up jacket.","The tan in the dress works well for any skin tone."
"wedding","I usually get a 4 or a 6, the 2 fit great.","I had to fix the top to accommodate for my small chest size.","Overall I loved the dress and it was FUN to wear it."
"wedding","The dress runs a little tight, as a result the liner rode up a lot throughout the night.","Otherwise the dress is very comfortable.","I wish that I had a picture of the full dress!"
"wedding","I received a lot of compliments on this one!","It was perfect for an early Spring wedding as it was light and airy.","The ruching also prevented any unflattering bumps from showing through!"
"wedding","Unfortunately, this has been my least favorite rental.","I got compliments on the dress because the color and lace are pretty, but I didnt feel very good in it.","I feel as if the lace around the neck and sleeves just didnt fit right, it started out a bit baggy on me and by the end of the night the lace ended up getting much more stretched out.","There are many other great RTR options, overall this isnt one of them."
"wedding","It fits very well and there is no need to wear a bra.","It is cut very low so make sure to use fashion tape so nothing slips out.","Overall, the fit was true to size, it was comfortable and I love the pockets.","I felt HOT in this dress and got a lot of compliments that night!"
"wedding","This dress was amazing and the fit was perfect !","I knew as soon as I put it on.","The quality and the style are amazing.","I wore it for a friends wedding and got so many compliments.","I definitely recommend it!"
"wedding","Great dress!","A little loose in some areas but overall - awesome!"
"wedding","It fit well everywhere except the chest.","I wore a size 10 and normally i am a 36 B.","It was a little constricting but not super uncomfortable."
"wedding","It has pockets!!!","!"
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress--I found it to be very comfortable and wearable--and VERY sparkly!","I went up a size in the dress because it can bunch and pull oddly around the hips/butt in a way that makes you look bigger than you are.","Also note, I rented this dress thinking it was gold-gold--that is not the case!","It is a rose-gold color with definite pink tones--absolutely beautiful, but not what you should get if youre looking for true gold.","I got a million and one compliments on the dress (I wore it to a wedding I was in) and absolutely loved it!"
"wedding","I wish I could do 6 stars in the rating--this was such a special dress for a wedding I was in.","I highly recommend sizing down for your backup--especially if you have a smaller bust.","And it had pockets--bonus!"
"wedding","Definitely low cut but incredibly flattering.","Plan for a little wardrobe tape to avoid showing too much :)"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a summer wedding and despite it being just a tad big in the waist area it was a great dress.","I tried to see if I could have a smaller size overnighted to me(FYI customer service was so easy and accommodating to work with) but unfortunately they were all out of it so I stuck with wearing the 10.","I received tons of compliments on it and the color was very popping!!","I wish I could have kept this dress!","!"
"wedding","I️ rented this for my best friends rehearsal dinner and Im so happy I️ did!","The dress was perfect and fit great.","The wedding party went out after dinner and the dress was still cute with a black leather jacket over it.","It can be formal or casual, whichever you prefer.","Highly recommend!","!"
"wedding","This dress is really beautiful!","I got compliments all night!","As other reviewers said, the zipper is really tricky and definitely requires a second person to zip it up.","I had to go braless because I just could not find a bra that wouldnt show with the cut of the dress.","The dress was definitely tight - if you have hips, size up!","Because it was pretty tight in the hips, it kept puckering on the lower back so I had to keep pulling it down.","Annoying to me, but not noticeable to anyone else.","This wasnt the most comfortable dress, but it is really beautiful."
"wedding","Overall I loved this dress and how comfortable it was!!!","The wedding I went was originally said to be formal, but I soon realized it was going to be much more casual.","Since I had already rented the dress I just went with it and was so happy I did.","I got a 10 and a 12 and the 12 ended up fitting best in the bust.","It was very slimming throughout and hit me at a great point on my waist.","I wore flat Jack Rogers sandals with the dress because the heels I had brought were too tall, but that ended up being great for me because people couldnt really see them and I was more able to dance the night away!","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!"
"wedding","Great convenient first experience with RTR.","Rented this for a wedding Rehearsal and it worked out.","The dress is great quality and the color is stunning on.","However, this probably wasnt the right style/cut for my body type.","I was hoping to hide my post-baby belly, but this ended up clinging in the wrong places.","Probably not best for people with bigger bottoms, or larger hips.","It was a bit short, but that didnt bother me too much.","When I dressed it up with a statement necklace, bracelet, and nude heels it was more flattering.","I wouldnt rent this again, but I would recommend it for a different body type since the color is amazing."
"wedding","The dress was bluer than in the picture which was nice.","It fit very well and was very flattering.","The only thing I didnt love was that you couldnt wear a bra and I felt like my chest looked smaller than usual.","The back was very pretty!"
"wedding","Considered wearing the larger size because of fit around waist, but wore spanx and decided to rock the tight fit.","Got lots of compliments."
"wedding","This dress is more beautiful in person (hard to see details in pics) and was very flattering and smoothing but had a few flaws.","The main flaw was that the straps were too long and loose.","I am 57 and have a long waist/torso and semi-broad shoulders, so if its long and loose on me, I cant imagine how it would fit on someone shorter or with a different figure.","Because of this, it did not support my boobs at all, and I felt like it did nothing to make them look good (I am a 32D - DD @ VS).","I actually think it might be better on someone with a smaller chest, or maybe if you are lucky to get one that doesnt have stretched out straps.","For that reason, I would not rent this dress again, which is disappointing because I had been super excited to rent it!!","However, I still give it 4 stars because WOW the quality is amazing and fits like a glove everywhere else!"
"wedding","I had to wear the bigger of the two sizes, and the dress was a little short, but still fit well.","I was comfortable, and felt bright during a summer wedding.","Would rent again for sure."
"wedding","Comfy and Fit beautifully to the curves...Just be cautious - lots of chest landscape on display!","Regular bra works great."
"wedding","Pictures dont do this dress justice.","I got so many compliments, and it was sexy yet appropriate for a black-tie wedding.","Beautiful color, stunning back, and it was the perfect length for my height with 3 heels.","Fashion tape a must for this dress so youre not hanging out!","The dress looks so good on that the front opening doesnt look inappropriate at all."
"wedding","This dress was perfect for a March wedding."
"wedding","Beautiful dress, great color!","Runs a little bit small (but not much).","I usually wear 4 or 6 (more often 4), but the 6R fit perfectly."
"wedding","I wore the 8 which is my normal dress size.","The shoulder straps seemed a little long and therefore I had some gaping at the bust.","I tried fashion tape but it didnt help much.","Also, the zipper was difficult to get up once the dress was on.","Those things being said, it was very comfortable , flattering and I received compliments on it from everyone, even the bride!","Wasnt too heavy either which i was worried about with the sequins."
"wedding","I really loved this dress, and I got many compliments on it.","The 4 fit well, except, with a size 34C chest, it was quite tight up top.","However, it wasnt uncomfortable, and didnt bother me.","I was very happy to see that the pink  material was stretchy and very flattering.","It was perfect for dancing.","The only other con, was really my height, as the length of the dress fell nearly right at my knees.","It wasnt ideal, but it also didnt look terribly awkward.","I really loved the dress, and would definitely recommend it for a formal wedding!"
"wedding","This is a fantastic dress!","I love the fit & flare silhouette, and the pockets were a cute touch.","I agree with other reviewers in that the dress was a bit tight in the bust - the fabric is quite substantial though and offers enough support to go bra-less.","And, it was plenty long enough for dancing!"
"wedding","This was actually one of the back up dressed Id selected and received when the originally dressed I picked out became unavailable.","I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order.","The dress fit perfectly and wasnt too long when can happen since I am on the shorter side.","As other ladies have mentioned, I did not need to wear a bra and I was comfortable through out the evening with lots of dancing at an outdoor Southern California wedding.","I received lots and lots of compliments on the dress!"
"wedding","I really liked the look of this dress and was pretty comfortable.","However, the dress fits a little tight on me than my usual size.","If you have bigger boobs/butt you may need to go up a size.","Also, be wary of the mermaid silhouette because it can be tight around your legs and you are not able to take long strides."
"wedding","The fit overall was gorgeous, but I did need to use shape wear for the first time ever to smooth out bumps.","I got many compliments on the color and overall fit.","I loved the neckline.","By the end of the night, a piece of boning had popped out of the bodice."
"wedding","Fit really well, tighter in the top.","Usually a size 6 but went up in size to make sure it fit perfect!","Loved how comfortable I was all night.","It has a lot of sparkle in person which was perfect for optional black tie!"
"wedding","This dress was beautiful, fun, and easy to wear!","It felt looser around the ribcage when I wore a smaller bra, but with a more padded bra, it filled out the dress nicely.","I ended up wearing the 4, but there was not much size difference compared to the 6.","The dress has a subtle trumpet shape, which I did not realize, and was a little longer than I would have liked for my shorter frame.","But overall, it was a great dress for a fall wedding.","The color was a lot of fun and the loose skirt made it very comfortable to wear all evening."
"wedding","Very light and comfortable dress and I was able to wear strapless bra with it."
"wedding","Like other reviews have mentioned, this was big in the bust for me (as well as the shoulders).","I may have needed to get a size down, but Im quite pear shaped and would have been nervous the 18W would have been too snug in the hips.","I easily safety-pinned the front to keep my ladies from popping out, and put some double stick tape on the back shoulders to help keep it pulled back.","This was my first time renting and I will definitely do it again."
"wedding","Fabric is a bit thicker which was great for a beach wedding.","I have a long torso, so sometimes rompers/pantsuits ride up my crotch, but this had plenty of room and I remained 🐪 free the entire evening.","Pant length was perfect for my 55 height.","Highly recommend nude or rose gold for shoe color."
"wedding","Hugged my body perfectly in all the right places.","Super elegant!"
"wedding","The fit was true to size, however to definitively shows off the girls I ended up pinning the dress after cocktail hour.","I felt more comfortable after that and was able to dance the night away and not worry about a wardrobe malfunction:),"
"wedding","The dress was beautiful and I received lots of compliments.","It does run small so I am glad I read the rest of the reviews and ordered 2 sizes up.","The sequins made it a bit scratchy towards the end of the night, but overall I was very happy with the dress!"
"wedding","Amazing!","I was a little nervous because a lot of people said it ran big.","But it fit perfectly.","I usually wear a 0 and the 0 fit in all the right places.","Guys below the knee in a midi style and the slit is the perfect height.","The color is to die for!","Its a very bright canary yellow.","Got compliments the whole night.","Rent this dress!","!"
"wedding","I had been eyeing this dress for a while, seen it worn by other women at events in DC and finally decided to rent for a wedding in New Orleans.","I really enjoyed wearing the dress and like that its a little different and the bold color.","Some members of my family did think it was too tight."
"wedding","It was easy to nurse my 6 month old in this dress because of the gaping neckline.","I did use a safety pin to make sure I didnt show too much cleavage.","It also disguised my postpartum belly very well!","Slightly long with my three inch heels."
"wedding","Im 57 and about 115lbs.","I was planning to wear 4 heels so the 2L sounded like a good fit.","I was planning to order the 0L as a backup but it was unavailable.","Im glad I ordered another style with size options because I was swimming in the 2L."
"wedding","I rented this dress and wore it 4.5 months pregnant - although my belly was still pretty small.","The dress was gorgeous.","Similar to some other reviewers, I did have to tie the straps in the back or else they would have been falling off all night.","I used a broach to keep them together.","The color in the skirt is almost a pale pink which doesnt completely come through in photos.","I absolutely loved this dress and highly recommend it!"
"wedding","I wore this to a winter Black Tie wedding in Texas.","This dress worked really well for my body shape: Im tall, a bit small-chested, with muscular legs/glutes.","I normally wear a 4 and the 4L fit like a glove.","I suggest wearing a statement necklace (and shoes!)","as this is a simple dress meant for accessorizing!","I did not wear a bra.","Although the dress has rubberized material on the inside of the bodice, I had some minor issues with the dress slipping down by the end of the night...I mostly attribute that to my wild dance moves!"
"wedding","I received SO many compliments from people I didnt even know.","I felt good in it and it was fun to wear.","The bottom kept getting caught in my heel from dance floor maneuvers but it was fine.","The pockets were great.","The dress stayed up pretty well.","I could not wear a bra as it was a bit tight.","I normally wear a 2/4, sometimes leaning on the 2 side.","I had to wear the 4.","I am"
"wedding","This was my backup dress for a blacktie wedding in Chicago this weekend.","I was upset I wasnt getting my original dress but this one turned out better than expected!","The color was great and it wasnt very heavy like I imagined.","The back sits higher than the pictures show which was a relief.","Pockets were a nice feature of course, and the slit in the skirt was great for cooling off from heat (ha!)","Definitely a tighter fit under the bust than above/on- I got the 4R and 6R and the 6 fit better in that area but the bust was way too loose.","(This seems to be a common review for most).","Otherwise I would say that at 57 the dress just touched the floor and I would of rather had the long had I of known, I wasnt able to wear heels with the dress which was a bummer.","Overall great fit and lots of compliments!","Would recommend!"
"wedding","Give a nice shape and great for long legs."
"wedding","I was so excited when this dress arrived!","The detail is so pretty and the lace is very feminine.","When I tried it on, I noticed that the shoulder area is looser and fashion tape is needed in the back to make the dress flat against your back.","The hip area is a big snug.","I tried on the size 2 and that was practically falling off my shoulders, but a much better fit in the hip area.","I ended up going with the 0 and wearing some Spanx!","I didnt find the dress to be too short and it was still easy to dance in.","I received many compliments!"
"wedding","Great fit.","Excellent coverage around the arms.","Not too revealing."
"wedding","This dress was a hit.","It was comfortable and perfect for dancing.","The wedding was in February in Atlanta so it was appropriate for winter but with the perfect amount of color (and Im a neutrals fan).","The skirt hem hit perfectly at my calves and I liked the fullness of the skirt.","The tea length hit was perfect for my height.","The top had the right amount of deep V although, I didnt wear a bra (and didnt need to).","The waistband was a bit tight per reviews, but I got used to it.","Overall, the dress was sophisticated and chic, and I felt comfortable all night."
"wedding","The dress was great!","I received so many compliments and ladies were even saying they were going to rent it for their next event.","It was a little roomy in the chest area but it worked out because I didnt have to worry about any undergarments, tape, etc.","The dress was a little brighter then the pictures online but it was a great color and not a bright obnoxious color.","I highly recommend this to anyone!","The back detail was great and just added that extra umph to the outfit!"
"wedding","Great nonblack option for a 7:00 wedding.","Thick material, best for fall or winter.","I didnt go  w/ a necklace b/c the neckline was so elegant.","Just added statement earrings."
"wedding","I was in awe of this dress.","You absolutely must rent this dress!","The color is bright and beautiful, the length is perfect.","I want to buy this dress.","I tried to order the size 2, because thats what I usually wear, but the one they were going to send me was either lost or damaged so they sent me my back up size 4, as well as two other dresses to make up for the inconvenience (super amazing gesture by the way).","The size 4 fit like a glove so I would recommend ordering a size up for your back up size, but I have no reference how my actual size wouldve fit, my guess is a bit snug in the chest.","I cannot recommend this dress enough!"
"wedding","I loved the fit of this dress - tight in the bust and tummy area but with enough room to dance on the bottom.","I wore 1 heels and it was the perfect length but with any higher heels I would recommend the long.","I dont have much in the boob area so I chose not to wear a bra but the stick on bra would work really well for this dress.","I felt like you could see my underwear line so I wore Spanx with the dress to smooth it out a little."
"wedding","This dress fit like a glove!","Tight fitting at waist but not too tight."
"wedding","I felt really shapely in this dress, despite my pear shape!","Trina Turk knows how to define the waistline and accentuate the positives.","I received so many compliments on this dress...wish I took a picture!","The only watch out on this dress is the neckline.","I am a full D up top and had to wear a cami underneath to keep this dress PG!","On the positive side...I was able to wear an everyday nude bra!"
"wedding","The dress fit great.","It was a little short but standing and dancing it wasnt a problem.","Overall the dress was true to size and I received complements all night long.","People couldnt believe it was a rented dress"
"wedding","Everything is true to size, color and size.","Highly recommend this for any occasion!"
"wedding","I am 52, 112lbs, small chest, and no curves.","This dress fit me perfectly!","I was originally nervous about the length, but I wore 4 inch heels, and it didnt drag at all.","It was very light weight and absolutely comfortable.","The picture looks as if it could be silver, but it is gold with some bronze tints.","If you are worried about renting this dress, dont, it is a FUN gown to sparkle in :)"
"wedding","I wore this dress for a wedding.","It definitely runs small; I was happy I had two sizes to choose from.","With said, there is some stretch in the dress.","So, even though its very fitted, its also very comfortable.","I loved the cutouts on the shoulder.","I paired it with opaque black tights to make it a little more conservative.","Overall, great rental!"
"wedding","It fit so well, and was perfect for the slightly vintage-y theme of the wedding I attended.","Only con was that it has absolutely no stretch and got really hot (outdoor wedding, was about 80 degrees).","That made it hard to dance in but I didnt really care because I felt great in it!"
"wedding","Opting out of a floor length gown, I rented this for a friends black tie wedding.","It was a good choice and I still felt very dressy and festive among the floor length gowns.","The dress was very comfortable and the pleating in the front is very forgiving.","I wore it with nude shoes to keep the focus on the dress and minimal jewelry.","The dress says it all -- no need to overdo it.","The only negatives about the dress is that the zipper in the back was really hard to pull up and I needed help getting it on and off.","The dress is also very revealing in the front and you will have to pin it."
"wedding","I loved everything about this dress!","Amazing color, perfect size, length, and LOVED the sleeves.","I would love to rent this again - possibly in another color!","?"
"wedding","Loved this dress so much!","I was worried the 0 would be too small but it was absolutely perfect.","The size 2 would have been way too big.","I wish I had more opportunities to dress up, I cant wait to get into another Elizabeth and James dress!"
"wedding","I felt so comfortable and glamorous in this dress.","Im broader in the shoulders and chest than most women, and this dress was relatively stretchy and fit like a glove.","The sequins didnt bother my underarms, and the back draping came up just enough on the sides to keep me from feeling over-exposed.","I ordered the dress in a petite, however I probably could have worn the regular length so the dress would have covered my shoes a bit more (I wore 3 inch heels).","I would definitely rent this dress again in another color."
"wedding","I had originally rented a different dress, but received an emailed from RTR the week it was supposed to arrive stating that I had to rent a different dress due to my dress being unavailable.","I picked this one and it arrived right when it was supposed to, so thank you to RTR for being super quick and helpful with everything.","This dress is different with the cheetah print, but it is still cute and classy for a wedding event.","I rented my normal size, a 2, and it fit well.","Around my arms was a tad tight and started to get uncomfortable after wearing the dress for a few hours.","It does poof out a tad more than I would have liked, but overall, I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"wedding","Be prepared for a lot of compliments in this nearly perfect ensemble.","Not only was it super comfortable, but the fit was flawless - I didnt even need to wear a bra!","(Bonus!).","As with any strapless item, I was a little worried about having to pull it up throughout the night, but it really wasnt much of an issue.","I did where a little fashion tape just in case since i didnt wear a bra with it (i think with the extra padding form a bra there would be no problem at all).","Oh!","and how could I forget..it has pockets!","!"
"wedding","comfortable to dress in - good length with short heels; tight but true to size"
"wedding","Im between 51-52 and ordered the 0P and wore 3-4 heels and was perfect length!","Im 113 lbs and 32dd and didnt wear a bra because this dress was lined very well and didnt need it!","Dont hesitate to order this dress, I got so many compliments that I lost count!"
"wedding","This dress was perfect for the fall wedding I attended in Cancun.","It was modest and pretty.","It was a little baggy up top, but Im rather petite.","I fabric is so nice and super comfortable and the color really does something for a blue-eyed girl.","I paired it with some rented gold accessories."
"wedding","Super comfy but too tight around the armpits/shoulders."
"wedding","Dress fit great, but the sleeves were way too tight.","I ordered a 2 and 4, and ended up going with the 4, even though the 2 fit my body better, because the 4s sleeves were a tiny bit wider."
"wedding","This dress is beautifully made but there is a lot of fabric, so it swallowed me and made me look larger than I am.","The front also seemed loose so I didnt wear the dress because I was scared my chest would pop out."
"wedding","I ordered a 4L with a 6L as the backup size.","Unfortunately, something happened at the last minute with the 4L, so they sent me the 6L with a different backup style in a 4.","It was unfortunate because while the 6 fit ok, the 4 would have been pefect.","I wear a DD bra, but Im narrow, so I had to continuously pull it up all night.","I loved that it came in long.","Im 59 and I was still able to wear 4 heels with it, which was AWESOME.","It was also long enough in the torso that it didnt creep up on me all night.","Because of the back closures, you cant get away with a strapless bra... but with the thickness of the material and having two layers across the chest I didnt need one.","I got compliments ALL night.","I wish could buy this outfit!!","Also, for anyone wondering... that adorable necklace is from target ;)"
"wedding","I was lucky enough to be the first person to wear this dress, as it came with the tags still on!","First off, it runs VERY small.","I have a petite frame up top (32D), and I normally order size 0 or 2 in tops at most stores.","I did some research before ordering since there were no reviews, and I read that when ordering Elizabeth & James, you should order a size up.","I decided to order size 2 - size 4 was my backup, but so glad I ordered the backup!","Also note that it is short - I included extra full length photos from when I first tried it on.","I liked the length, though.","Overall, very flattering dress.","I received lots of compliments!"
"wedding","I feel like the photos dont do it justice.","This is a great, light, modern dress, perfect for an evening, summer wedding.","The highest sheer line is high enough to give a hint of sexy.","I felt so pretty.","Note I have a small chest.","There was room for more there, but it stayed up well enough I wasnt pulling all night."
"wedding","True to size!","I am in my late 50s, 57 123 lbs....wore a 6L.","Let me tell you, no one would believe my age, especially in this dress....   My decision was based on a customers picture and comment, Rent this Dress!","I can now truly say the same thing....Stop wasting time, rent this dress...it is beautiful...a show stopper!","A lot of the comments from just the picture of us was It looked like an actress showed up to the wedding!...","Everyone and I mean everyone commented on how beautiful this dress looked...And, you feel so beautiful in this gown!","I am convinced and will definitely use Rent the Runway for every event I attend!","Well worth it!","The service is great too!"
"wedding","I ordered the size 4 and 6, and wore the 4 for the wedding.","Fits great on top.","It was a little low on the knees for me, but I am a short person.","I just paired it with a pair of stilettos and it worked!","You cant tell from the pictures, but there is tulle underneath the skirt which keeps it full and bouncy.","I was concerned about the lace panel on the sides.","I am not comfortable going braless so I purchased a nude sheer bra.","I highly recommend this dress!"
"wedding","I typically wear a size 6 and ordered a size 6 and 8 for a backup.","The 6 arrived and there was a bit of damage on the dress such as no clasp on the back and lace hanging off the edges.","The 8 fit much better for someone with a figure and was not as damaged.I did not feel as constricted and think that the 8 was a much better fit.","I liked the dress overall but it is tight in the waist, right under the bust line."
"wedding","I thought this dress looked much prettier on the model.","As the other reviews have mentioned, the sleeves are small and it takes some careful effort to put your arms through.","Its especially harder because of the lace.","My dress actually had a hole in the sleeve lace but it didnt matter because I pulled the sleeves up past my elbow.","The dress is very form fitting so you must be comfortable with your body.","I have wide hips and I actually felt really self-conscious about myself.","I did receive compliments though.","Also, this dress (in this size) was clearly worn many many times.","The lace was lifting and was getting linty.","My backup size 4 was in pretty mint condition, however, I didnt wear this one."
"wedding","This is a beautiful dress.","The color and the lace is gorgeous!","I usually wear between a six and an eight – definitely had to go with the eight in this one.","The lace in the arms was a tiny bit snug (my arms are a bit full and athletic), but not too bad.","Because I am short the length did fall below my knees.","I think this dress would look better on someone a bit taller, or if you are my height, a bit thinner.","I think with my height and weight it made me look a little boxy.","All that being said, it really is a beautiful dress and I would recommend it!"
"wedding","The bodice really has no give so be careful on your measurements.","Very flattering dress.","loved wearing it"
"wedding","Overall a very beautiful dress—got a ton of compliments!","The silhouette and fabric were perfect for a semi-formal wedding.","The fit was very comfortable but, a little big in the bust—I could have possibly went with a size 0.","It was also a bit longer than expected but, was by no means dowdy.","I paired it with simple black suede pumps, studded crystal statement earrings and a minimal diamond necklace.","This dress gets a 8.5-9/10 for me!"
"wedding","This dress fits in all the right ways, and the color in the RTR model photo is just as vibrant in-person.","The material is heavy, so I went without a bra and had no trouble.","Super comfortable and didnt have to futz with it all night.","It does hug your form, so be careful to find seamless underwear or spanx if you are planning on wearing any.","I wore this with 4 inch heels, and the regular was just the right height!","Its a great/versatile option to dress up or down with jewelry."
"wedding","Beautiful dress, received many compliments.","Fit well although I could have worn the 6  I went with the 8 since the top  was fitted.","My only thing with the dress was the hem kept flipping up and would not stay down so in pictures and when I would move around i had to keep fixing it.","It could have been the way it was pressed and maybe just the one I had.","The back was gorgeous, definitely cant wear a bra with the dress.","Length was at my knee."
"wedding","The fit is true to size.","I rented this but didnt end up wearing it.","But with that said, Id probably wear it for the next wedding event.","It has little sequins sewn into the fabric and the beautiful pink lace overlay is absolutely gorgeous.","The only weird thing about this dress was the strange inside zipper.","I couldnt really figure out what purpose that was serving because it just hung there on its own.","ALSO...","I am 57 and even in 4 inch heels, this dress was LONG.","I will go with the regular next time."
"wedding","Between the dress, hair and makeup, I felt like I was on the red carpet all night.","Worn for a black tie wedding and reception, this dress was a great fit.","Im usually a 2 in day to day wear, but tend toward a size 4 with designer dresses.","The 2 fit like a glove, so Id say it runs a little large.","Im a 34C, and was able to wear and dance comfortably without a bra.","The hi-lo hem was a beautiful and unique touch, and perfect for girls on the short side who may trip over long gowns."
"wedding","This dress was amazing!","The only issue was the bow snaps were very easily undone, and near impossible to re-snap on your own.","My husband had to re-snap them a couple times throughout the night."
"wedding","It was a little tight in the sleeves and the material a little thick.","I did a lot of dancing and was in southern humidity, so I was a little hot.","But I dont regret wearing the dress.","It was a little short on me, so I had it hemmed to make it a more fun length."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a friend who absolutely loved it!","It hugged her curves and hid all unflattering areas.","She said she got so many compliments.","She rented the 8R and 10R and found the 10R to be more comfortable (even though shes normally a size 8) because the sleeves were tighter on the 8.","If you have bigger/broader shoulders go for a size up.","The fabric was stretchy and although full of sequins it didnt irritate her.","Shes 53 and 150 lbs with an hourglass shape and the size 10 fit her perfect."
"wedding","This is my first experience renting with RTR.","The dress fits like a dream -- it minimizes my problem areas and maximizes my assets!","Im 59, 150 pounds but I imagine itd be very flattering on most body types.","I got compliments all night long, and felt amazing.","Great dress for dancing, medium-heavy material might not be best suited for a hot outdoor wedding but perfect for an indoor fall celebration!"
"wedding","Received a ton of compliments on this dress!","And absolutely loved how it photographed for the wedding I was in!","Like most of the Nicole Miller dresses Ive worn, the fabric is thin / dress is form fitting.","Spanx are definitely recommended under the dress to help give a smooth finish in the middle region (be careful though as you could possibly see the lining of the spanx through the dress).","However, the little bit of ruching in the front helps hide to some extent.","The 8L was a bit short for my height + 2.5 inch heels.","The back was beautiful.","Definitely recommend!"
"wedding","I LOVED this dress.","The colors are bright and fun and all I needed was a clutch and earrings to accessorize.","Im 59 and lotsa leg so yes, it was pretty short as many reviews have said.","I sized up from my usual 4 to a 6 for just that little bit of length.","But I managed and just had to be really mindful of how I moved.","Great great dress."
"wedding","I did not end up wearing this dress, unfortunately.","I got it as a backup to another dress in hopes that it would work.","It was very pretty, had great detail, and the color was amazing; however I just didnt have the right undergarments for the occasion.","It is very low cut, so stickies are a must.","Also, while the back is lace, it is see-through.","I needed to wear spanx, but didnt have the right kind with me that was low enough.","A bigger size may have worked, but all there was available was a small.","Great dress - maybe for another time!"
"wedding","This dress is absolutely gorgeous.","I received compliments all night and the next day.","I agree with the other posts that the fit is a bit awkward at first, but you get used to it and I had no trouble dancing all night.","I will most definitely rent this again.","As far as size goes- my true size is between an 8 and a 10 and the 8 fit perfectly.","And shoutout to customer service- I had ordered two other dresses that had flaws and they rushed me two additional dresses within two days so I would have them for the event- they rock, thank you!"
"wedding","This dress is absolutely perfect for a fall wedding.","I was worried it was going to be a little heavy, but it was totally fine.","I did have to wear the backup size, the 10 was a little too tight across my chest.","If you are considering renting this dress, do it.","You will not be disappointed!"
"wedding","Its a super pretty dress!!","I rented this with my unlimited subscription since Im on the hunt for a dress to wear to my brother in laws wedding.","This dress wouldve fit the bill but Im very large busted (34DDD).","and it was just too tight.","I could zip it up all the way, but it looked tight unfortunately.","I rated it as true to size since it really did fit everywhere else perfectly and I think someone with a slightly smaller chest would definitely fit.","I wouldve loved to wear this dress."
"wedding","I typically wear a 2, but they were all sold out by the time I went to rent this dress so I took a risk and rented a 0 and 4.","I just squeezed into the 0, so it didnt fit me perfectly, but I loved it anyway.","I wore it to a Spring wedding and got lots of compliments, highly recommend."
"wedding","Gorgeous dress.","Runs true to size.","I am 58 size 12."
"wedding","I was initially afraid to order this because it was a white dress but there was enough blue and enough of a patter where I wasnt uncomfortable to wear it to a wedding.","The neck area certainly runs small as I had read on other reviews, I was nervous because of my chest size.. my normal dress size made me feel squished, Im glad I ordered the size up because it was much more comfortable.","Great dress!"
"wedding","I am a small female and loved every detail about the dress with the exception of the fit in the shoulders.","The 0 was a little to large across the shoulders.","A little fashion tape probably could have helped due to the back detail, but I was constantly pulling at it all night.","Other than that, what a fantastic and amazing dress!"
"wedding","I got a million compliments on this dress.","It was super flowy and it has a ton of fabric so its a bit more dressy than a maxi dress.","The only cons were that the dress was a bit long.","Im 54 and wore 4.5 inch heels and I stepped on the bottom a few times.","I also had to constantly pull it up on the dance floor.","Other than that I loved it."
"wedding","Both sizes fit very well but the 8 was just a little more snug when I say down so I wore the 10.","The 10 was just a little big in the  chest but an over all good fit."
"wedding","If there will be dancing - DO NOT WEAR THIS DRESS.","Other people mentioned it water stains and that is so true.","A cooler dripped on me on my way to the ceremony and it stained the dress.","Its also a concern if other people on the dance floor have drinks in their hand because it will stain!","Other than that I have broad shoulders and this style really emphasized that.","I wasnt crazy about it but I wore the dress regardless!"
"wedding","I would give this dress 4.5 stars if I could because, while I didnt absolutely head over heels love it, overall it was really great, especially for a fall wedding.","The color is much brighter and bolder than in the picture of the model.","The fit is flattering but definitely runs on the larger size.","I typically wear an 8 and wore the backup size 6 and it was still a bit roomy (which I think is partially by design).","The dress has pockets, which is an added plus, and the fabric feels expensive.","It was very comfortable and great for dancing.","Overall, a really great dress!"
"wedding","The Regular size was too short on me with heels.","The Long size was basically perfect!"
"wedding","Fit true to size"
"wedding","Im a 510 , A-cup.","I think this would work best for a small bust because you cant wear a bra and support is minimal.","Additionally, works better for tall women (with a long torso) because the straps, which are NOT adjustable, are VERY long.","I needed to pin each strap with a safety pin, 1 inch on both sides to make it work.","Easy enough, but someone shorter would have to pin a LOT more and Im not sure what that would do to the overall fit.","Got a lot of compliments though and loved the dress, strap issues aside."
"wedding","The dress is beautiful and fit very well on me.","The arms are a bit snug but other than that I got A LOT of  praise and compliments on this dress."
"wedding","I wore this to my bridal shower and received lots of compliments.","It was a good length - not too short, but not dowdy, and the lace gave it a sweetness.","There is some puffiness to the skirt so it doesnt lay flat - it would be fun to dance in.","It was perfect for my daytime shower!"
"wedding","I ordered this dress in an 8 and 10 based on reviews.","Since I have a 38B bust Ive had trouble with 8s being a little snug around the ribcage.","I probably could have worn either comfortably, but the 8 was just a little shorter (which looked better when I changed out of my heels to get on the dance floor).","I was complemented all night long and felt beautiful!"
"wedding","Its definetly a show stopper.","If you have curves they will be nicely accentuated..."
"wedding","The dress itself is beautiful!","The material is thick, so it doesnt show your imperfections.","The fit is really weird though.","I fit in the XS, but the band around the waist was so tight I thought I may bust if I ate anything.","I went with the small.","There was a lot of extra material in the hips, and it was a couple inches too long for my taste (Im about 54).","The V is also really low.","I am a 34C and felt very inappropriate going to a wedding, so I used some safety pins.","I tried using fashion tape but didnt feel it would be secure."
"wedding","Runs large.","Im typically a size 6-8 jeans and a small top (roughly 150 lbs) and I ended up wearing a size 4."
"wedding","Fit just right, not too tight in the hips."
"wedding","I have rented this dress a total of 3 times now (work function, the Kentucky Derby, and a wedding).","It is the perfect dress for anyone with a curvy figure.","The lace really makes it look sophisticated, but the fit is super comfortable and non-fuss (you can wear regular undergarments).","BONUS: It has pockets!","The only negative is it is super tight in the chest and sleeves.","I ordered a size 12 (height 5 10, 180 pounds, 36D chest)."
"wedding","It was big through the chest (but I am small chested) and the back was too low to wear a strapless bra."
"wedding","Loved this dress - definitely could not wear a bra, but did ok without one"
"wedding","I wore this dress 22 weeks pregnant with a little bump and found it to be very comfortable and forgiving.","The tight part hit right above my bump, which meant I was able to wear my normal size so the straps/top fit perfectly.","With a lot of sequin dresses, you get some rubbing under the arms, but I was in this for 6+ hours and didnt have that happen at all.","Definitely recommend, especially for the price!"
"wedding","This dress is gorgeous.","It is very tight with little-no give, but beauty is pain and it was worth it.","I was a little worried it would be too hot for an outdoor wedding (length and fabric), but I wasnt overheated at all.I would absolutely rent this dress again."
"wedding","LOVED this dress!!","It was so cute, details of the neckline were gorgeous, and the back was super fun.","I am only 52, so the length was perfect.","The color really pops, it is a great red.","I was able to dance in it all night!","Such a comfy dress.","Received compliments all night long.","Will absolutely rent again."
"wedding","I wore this to a friends wedding that was Woodstock themed.","While I realize I may not entirely fit the theme, I was looking for a bohemian/laid back style.","The material is silky soft and beautiful quality.","The dress is fancier than it appears in the picture, not an everyday lounging dress.","This can definitely be dressed up.","I am very flat chested and it did not slip on me at all.","The only issue I had was with the length.","Im about 52 and it was incredibly long.","I wore wedges as I knew Id be in grass and didnt want to wear heels.","It still dragged quite a bit so I tied up the side for a portion of the night so I could walk around more comfortably.","I would tell anyone to rent this.","So many compliments!"
"wedding","Very comfortable and flattering dress.","Loved the subtle animal print pattern.","Conservative length, looked great with some nude pumps.","Fit true to size for me.","I also loved that you can wear a regular bra with this dress."
"wedding","I rented this in a size 8 and 10.","The size 8 was perfect around the bust, too tight around the hips.","The size 10, which is what I wore to the wedding, was a perfect fit around the hips, but the chest was too big.","I battle the sleeves falling and the top just being too big throughout the wedding and reception.","I changed for the after party into my own little black dress, and felt so much more comfortable."
"wedding"," The dress was stunning.","I was a little nervous about the fit, but a medium was perfect.","The dress is definitely low cut, but nothing a little fashion tape couldn’t solve.","As other people said the zipper is a little hard to zip up.","The material is a little heavy, which was great during a November ceremony and while dancing!","I would definitely rent again!"
"wedding","Overall fit was good.","Its a little heavy, I was warm for a summer wedding but that wasnt a great  concern.","I wore a chunky necklace with it."
"wedding","This dress fit great...was snug but not too tight.","I however disagreed with the length...I am 56 and wore2 1/2 heels so I got the long as recommended, but it was definitely too long.","I had to pay close attention all night so as not to trip over the dress, which wasnt ideal.","Otherwise, I loved it and it fit true to size!"
"wedding","Perfect fit!","No complaints.","Nice stretch to the fabric.","Loved the slit for more sex appeal."
"wedding","Beautiful dress but it was a little too tight in the midsection.","The length was perfect and the quality was good."
"wedding","form fitting, but not tight - the material is stretchy enough that it is not uncomfortable to wear."
"wedding","This dress was a showstopper, I felt beautiful and sexy in it!","I was a little nervous about the cutouts and not being able to wear spanx under the dress, but it hits your curves in all the right places and is super slimming.","Being full busted I am always cautious about the dresses I wear, but because I could wear a regular bra, the dress fit amazing.","The material is very comfortable and stretchy, I honestly could have probably sized down from the size I normally wear.","I got soooo many compliments on this dress and would rent it again in a heartbeat.","PERFECT for the black tie optional wedding I went to in New Orleans."
"wedding","It definitely fits tighter in the hips, but I was still able to wear my usual size.","Agree that you should size up though for your back-up.","Its a classic dress that doesnt come across as too light for a wedding guest."
"wedding","I was an actual smokeshow.","The length was perfect for wearing with high heels.","Cant wear a bra with this so I opted for nude pasties.","I was flawless all night.","I wish I could wear this dress everywhere."
"wedding"," It looked outstanding in person.","I was hesitant about the dress being ankle length but that was not an issue, it was adorable.","I wore this a wedding and so so many people commented on how cute it was.","I did not find the cut out to be annoying or too excessive.","I was able to wear a regular bra with this dress which is a bonus.","I rented a 2 and 4 and ended up wearing the 2.","I am a true 4 so maybe size down on your extra dress."
"wedding","Great black tie wedding dress.","Received tons of compliments all night.","Easy to wear dress.","Can not wear regular bra..low back."
"wedding","Was forgiving for a lace dress!"
"wedding","You will need to make sure that (if you size up) that the top doesnt look too loose.","Overall a great dress."
"wedding","This dress was so great!","This was my first time using Rent the Runway, and the whole experience was wonderful.","I received many compliments on the dress, and I felt very comfortable in it.","It definitely hid my belly, which is usually a problem for me.","The dress is not form fitting, so if youre looking for something to highlight your figure, you might want to pick a different style, but I enjoyed feeling comfortable and pretty at the same time (rather than having to choose one or the other!).","I usually wear a size 16, and I ordered 16W with the 14W as backup.","I ended up wearing the size 16 for the underlayer and the size 14 for the sparkly top layer (the 14 would have fit for both, but the dress was a tiny bit short on my 511 self and the size 16 underlayer was a little longer).","I would absolutely recommend this dress, and as others have suggested, would suggest ordering your regular size with the next-smaller size as backup."
"wedding","Very cute.","Runs small around chest."
"wedding","This would have to be the best dress I have ever rented.","I have never received so many compliments on a dress before.","It was stunning and fit perfectly."
"wedding","This dress was stunning!","I didnt have a backup size because the dress was in such high demand but the dress fit perfectly.","I received a small refund because it came with a small stain, but my hair covered it up so I decided to wear the dress anyway.","So many compliments!","Great first RTR experience."
"wedding","The fit was perfect!","True to size.","Im short, so it was really long, but it was still manageable.","The zipper is TOUGH.","It was a 3 person job (me holding the dress up, mom holding the top of the zipper and stretching it out, and dads strength to pull it up).","Other than that very small snag (um.. pun not intended), it felt wonderful, no poking boning or anything, and it was so fun to wear.","And the color is so gorgeous!"
"wedding","The got was perfect and nice color.","This was my back up dress though, and  I chose my first choice."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a rehearsal dinner and loved it.","It fit really well, and looked great.","I will say that the fabric is thicker than expected and would probably be better worn in the spring or fall when the weather is a bit cooler."
"wedding","Fits pretty true to size.","I recommend pairing it with a belt to cinch in your waist.","I wore a nude colored belt with nude shoes :)"
"wedding","This dress is beautiful and fit perfectly!"
"wedding","Didnt need a bra.","Lined with a nice satin.","Good structure.","Fun mermaid shape and sexy sophisticated back detailing."
"wedding","The dress fit really well and was very flattering.","I appreciated the clasps in the straps to hide bra straps!","The color was great and the sparkle really gave it something extra cute."
"wedding","The color is amazing and definitely stands out.","The fit was true to my usual dress size and was easily worn with a strapless bra.","I got a ton of compliments and was so sad to return it!"
"wedding","Dress was just short enough to wear sandals with for me but wouldve also been perfect with wedges.","I found the neck to be a little tight at first but after awhile, I got used to it.","The sheer parts of the skirt made this perfect for a hot outdoor July wedding and I would definitely rent again!"
"wedding","Fit was perfect!","So many people loved it!"
"wedding","The dress is made of a gorgeous material.","The waist was just too small for me.","I usually wear an 8/M, however my size is in the waist.","Lovely dress, wish it fit."
"wedding","I loved this dress!","A high neck line usually makes me feel like Im choking, but this didnt, very comfortable.","Bump friendly for sure!","I got so many compliments."
"wedding","It fit really well in the waist and hips (which usually doesnt happen because I have hourglass shape and hips usually run a size larger than waist).","However, it was too big on top.","I wore strapless bra and it was ok.","Otherwise loved it, super comfy!","I got the regular length and wore it with 2.5-inch heels and that was perfect.","If you are tall and want to wear higher heels I would definitely go for the long."
"wedding","Showstopper!","Love this unique dress.","This dress runs true to size and is very stretchy.","This is great for any cup size and has comfortable room for hips.","This may be worn with a standard bra.","My favorite feature is that the slit is adjustable, so you can make it either long or short!","Pair this with simple earrings!"
"wedding","Beautiful color, love the fit and the heft of this dress; just made me look a bit broad-shouldered and wide.","Really gorgeous and modest for a daytime wedding or luncheon sort of thing."
"wedding","Lord how I loved this dress.","I was looking for something unusual for my wedding, but as I live in Vegas I had to concede that it was just too heavy/hot for 116 degrees outdoors.","But it looked beautiful, and I moaned so much to the new hubby that I would never have need to wear such a stunner again that I decided to just wear it around the house.","It made the vaccuming feel a bit more glamorous and when I went out to get the mail the neighbors were quite rightly awed.","Either that or they thought I was some kind of high end call girl.","I dont care...","If I am ever in need of a fabulous gown that will be my go to dress."
"wedding","This dress fit well in all the right places.","I am more self conscious about the tummy/hip area and this dress was perfect in hiding that.","I got a 6 and 8.","I could have worn the 6 but opted for the 8 for a bit more comfort.","It was super comfortable and fun to dance in.","This was my first time using RTR and this dress makes me want to do this for every event I have!"
"wedding","Fit is great.","I did have to wear heels, which I was going to wear anyway."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding and it was perfect.","I ordered the 4R and 6R because the reviews were about 50/50 for people my size.","The 4 fit, tightly in the chest and arm/shoulder area.","I decided to wear the 6 because it was slightly longer and had more room in the arm/shoulder area...which made me feel more comfortable dancing in.","The 4 is definitely wearable, its just tighter if thats what you like!","I also really liked how this dress barely touched the floor -- great for dancing in..."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a California October wedding and it was perfect!","This dress fit amazingly, and the straps in the back were not loose at all!","The skirt part was very flared and the material helped hold the shape throughout the night.","Overall, super fun, classy, and beautiful.","Rent this dress!"
"wedding","The dress is pretty but would not be a dress I would by.","As other reviewers have said, it is tight on the bottom.","Because of this I felt it bunched a little in my belly area, and really did nothing to shape my boobs....However, that being said, I did like the dress, and I liked it overall.","Just not may favorite."
"wedding","Super long...be prepared to hold it up - even with heels.","It will drag!"
"wedding","it complimented my figure nicely, the only interesting part is the back flap that looks like a bra strap but other than that was awesome!"
"wedding","The dark navy color was amazing and the flow of the dress was beautiful.","The dress ran a little large.","I would have wanted it to hug me a little tighter.","The back was a little loose but it didnt bother me too much throughout the night.","It was a great selection for the event!","I got the 0L and with 6 inch heels, there was still some fabric on the ground."
"wedding","Fit great, a little tight in the arms, but I was still able to move and dance just fine.","Elegant but still fun dress"
"wedding","I wore this beautiful dress to a formal wedding.","I received many compliments.","Im 55 and the dress was a little long for me, so I wore 4 inch heels to get the dress a little off the floor."
"wedding","As other reviewers have said, this dress is beautiful and you will gets many compliments.","The colors are beautiful and bright but you definitely cannot be afraid to stand out!","The bottom is more red than I was anticipating.","As others have said, the neck is rather tight.","I went with the 6P just for comfort in the neck although the 4P fit fine everywhere else.","I am only 51 so I loved that it came in petite size.","I wore 4 heals and the dress was just brushing the ground.","Overall, one of my favorite rentals - would definitely recommend!"
"wedding","This is my first time ordering from RTR and it was a great experience.","I picked this dress for a friends wedding.","I ordered two sizes.","The dresses arrived in time for the event and were in like new condition.","They were both pressed and ready to be worn.","Im 54 and 115 lbs.","The size 2 fit.","It was a little snug but not uncomfortable.","Typically, size 2 fits fine but I was a little bloated, so in hindsight I could have picked a size 4 as my backup but that was just poor planning on my part.","The dress hit just above my knees.","I think gold jewelry and nude heels looked best with this dress.","I loved the pattern and the style!","I got many compliments at the wedding.","Definitely recommend this dress for a wedding or any formal event."
"wedding","I am normally a 4.","I am not super large busted so I went for the 2R.","The 2 was also a better length for me.","(Im 54).","It is really difficult to zip and unzip on your own so make sure you have help!","I would totally get this dress again.","I wish they had a petite size because I had to wear super tall shoes to make it fit."
"wedding","So comfortable and the color is gorgeous!"
"wedding","I coordinated well with the Vermont foliage!","Nothing too fancy about this dress, just a well-fitting and flattering piece.","Note that the zipper can definitely get stuck, resulting in some pre-ceremony panic... take it slow and youll be fine!"
"wedding","I love this dress and received a lot of compliments on it.","I wanted to be sure it would fit so I went to the DvF store before it arrived and tried it on in the sizes I ordered through rent the runway.","I usually wear a 2 but I wore a 4.","The 2 wouldve worked if I were going out or something because it was tight in a sexy way that wasnt quite right for my bridal shower.","The 4 was still form fitting so was perfect and comfortable.","The one thing I was most disappointed in which was my own error was the color.","When I tried on the white at DvF I liked it a lot more than the ivory available through RTR.","I didnt realize there were both ivory and white options so it didnt even occur to me but still worked out well."
"wedding","Fit perfectly!","Wasnt too tight in the tummy and the off the shoulder straps were actually comfortable.","I did wear a strapless bra with this dress and had to make sure it didnt show through the cut out in the front but overall, the fit was great and it was a comfortable dress!"
"wedding","Great fit!","I love the way the dress is longer in the back, and the design is lovely.","Perfect for a winter wedding."
"wedding","Very fitted through the rib cage and bust, with a very difficult zipper!!","(not you MUST have a 2nd persons zip you up!)","Loved the color and the flowy (is that a word?)","fabric!!","Again RTR didnt disappoint- this dress was amazing and I felt beautiful and was comfortable all night .","This was for a wedding in CA and I paired with the BM earrings and gold flip flops.","Im 56 and the regular length was perfect.","Just rent this dress... You will not be disappointed."
"wedding","I wore this pretty yellow dress to a wedding in Asheville in May.","This dress is very flattering and comfortable.","The fabric has some stretch so I could still move around comfortably in the 90 degree weather.","It was a tad long, but I am more than a tad short, so no complaints.","I definitely recommend this dress."
"wedding","Majority of the dress fit fine, except the straps kept falling down.","Also felt like I was showing a lot of cleavage having larger girls.","Would probably look great on someone with a B-C size chest."
"wedding","I wore this dress to an Oct outdoor wedding.","The main reason I picked it was because it has long sleeves, something I dont usually wear in dresses.","As soon as I tried it on I fell in love with the fit.","It hits all the right places just right and flares out a tiny bit after the waist which helps hide larger hips.","Almost everyone at the event commented on it (all compliments), would definitely recommend!"
"wedding","Fit:  True to size.","Im usually a 2, a 0 on a good day, and the 0 was way too tight for my imperfect hips/waist.","5 lbs ago I could probably have fit in the 0.","Short girls - order the P (petite sizes) if you dont plan on wearing more than a 3 inch heel.","I wore 5.3 inch YSLs so those worked for my 52 height.","It was a very good length.","I think this dress will work whether you are busty or not - because the material is stretchy and somewhat forgiving, you will fit just right if you are small, and if you are larger, you will fill it out nicely.","The top fits a little bit large.","Pros:  Stretchy and forgiving fit, elastic material.","Very elegant, very classy, the thigh slight hits perfectly on the leg, super versatile, no necklace needed if you do earrings and a bracelet on the strapless arm side.","It really is like getting 2 looks in 1.","It is a very unique and stylish dress.","You will no doubt receive compliments on it.","Cons:  SEE THROUGH!!","Beware, if you are wearing a strapless bra, wear a BLACK one.","No nude, no white.","I wore a nude strapless bra first and thank goodness I had taken a picture before leaving the house.","With the flash, you could see the bra through the dress.","Solution for me was throwing a black bandeau over my bra since I dont have a black strapless.","I also hooked the strap on the convertible bra under the covered shoulder for extra support.","Other than it being slightly sheer under the flash of a camera, the flap thing can be annoying if you are particular.","Also noticed the long sleeve/shoulder area on the covered side was a little baggy, even with my broad shoulders.","Lastly, the material seems a bit thin/elastic I think I would have liked something a tiny bit thicker or sturdier."
"wedding","It has a pretty high waist line.","I ended up wearing a size smaller than normal because I have a smaller chest and since it wasnt fitted around the stomach it worked well.","The fabric is very thick.","Very flattering dress."
"wedding","The dress was wonderful.","I saw it on a friend - she rented it for OUR wedding, but that whole day was a blur.","I rented it for a wedding and got the 6 and the 8.","The 6 fit like a glove.","Though I will say if you work out and youre pretty developed in the shoulder area, the dress may be tight along the shoulders.","Other than that, it fit perfectly, and people were obsessed and kept asking me where I got it."
"wedding","This dress runs VERY true to size.","Once its zipped up, there is very little wiggle room in the rib cage area.","The material, which looks just like leather, doesnt have much give but looks so great on.","I received compliments all night.","The dress is very heavy (short, but weighed like 6 pounds!)","so I wouldnt recommend it for a hot outdoor affair."
"wedding","Fit well!"
"wedding","was a little tight, spanx solved the problem"
"wedding","Edgy and classy, only up close do you notice the style is slightly masochistic with the overlay being black mesh.","The empire waist sits slightly lower than I preferred (long torso) so it cut into me a little bit throughout the night, but you couldnt see that and I wore spanx to prevent the bulge where it would have protruded (slightly visible in try on pic but smooth w/ spanx).","I am somewhere between an 8-10 and chose the 8 because it fit nicer and was better for a Miami wedding."
"wedding","Good fit but not the most flattering if you are pear shaped."
"wedding","I wore this dress for an early September wedding, and it was perfect!","I was worried that green was going to be a deep/winter color, but the reviews were spot on; it was bright/vibrant/rich!","I loved the low-scooped back, and was able to get away with not wearing a bra.","I was on the dance floor all night, and it was comfortable.","The only con would have to be where the dress tightened, in the stomach/high hip area, which made it a little awkward when sitting.","BUT!!","Other than that, I got compliments on the dress all night, and even days to follow on all the photos!"
"wedding","I loved this dress!","It fit great and was definitely true to size.","I am 51 and usually wear a size 2.","The regular length is perfect if you are shorter.","I wore 3 inch heels and the dress just hit the floor.","The only downside was that it was VERY form fitting in the hips so tough to hide mid section if that is something that is concerning to you.","Def wear spanx.","All in all was perfect for me!!","!"
"wedding","Its a great dress and very flattering.","The top of the dress has a very open neckline and it is low.","Im busty so I feel like I was picking it up a lot.","I did receive a lot of complements, but another wedding guest had the same dress on!"
"wedding","Paired this with gold wedges for an outdoor late-summer wedding."
"wedding","I was worried that this dress would be a little heavy for august as the photos look like its a heavier material.","However, i was pleasantly surprised to find a lighter material which was perfect for an outdoor wedding.","The colors were vibrant and beautiful.","The cutout was classy yet fun.","Even my grandmother complimented me!","It had a vintage glam vibe to it.","I would definitely rent this one again!"
"wedding","I chose the 6L as 6R was not available.","I actually felt like I could have got away ordering 4R .","I think the 6L was a bit long but my shoes was high enough to pull it.","Surprisingly the dress doesnt look as vibrant in person and initially thought they sent me the wrong color but once I took the picture I just realized it pictures differently."
"wedding","I wore this to my engagement party.","I rented the 8 and the 10 and ended up going with the 10.","The 8 was just a  little too snug in the middle where the seam is for me to feel comfortable.","Thats often a problem for me because I have a short waist where Im the thinnest naturally doesnt usually match up with where dresses are cut to be the smallest.","I belted it with a thin gold sparkly belt and wore brown shoes and a white cardigan.","Felt like the dress was a nice balance for the event I wore it to.","I didnt want to be too casual or too formal, but I did want to have some white in there because, duh...bride.","I would rent again."
"wedding","Fit was true to size, others said it was on the large end.","I didnt find that to be true.","Comfortable all night.","Im a C36 and no need for a bra.","A little warm for a 85 degree day but elegant and I felt beautiful.","Also- a little long if you plan to get down on the dance floor but I held it up and it wasnt a second thought."
"wedding","My original RTR dress did not work out.","Customer service was excellent and my stylist Bobby, suggested this dress.","This dress was perfect - I received compliments all night.","The fit was great and the dress looked amazing.","Love RTR."
"wedding","Received many compliments on this dress and absolutely loved the pockets.","Did not need to bring a purse as the were able to carry all of my belongings.","My only complaint is that the mesh at the top was itchy and caused a minor rash on my sensitive skin.","Overall, perfect for the occasion."
"wedding","The quality and style of this dress are amazing.","So far one of my favorite dresses Ive rented.","It was lightweight and the fabric was comfortable.","I originally ordered the 36 and I couldnt zip it up (I have broad shoulders), so I re-ordered the 38 and it was perfect.","Will definitely rent again."
"wedding","Im normally between a 4 and a 6.","The 4 was a little tight in the chest so I went with the 6 for comfort.","The dress was very comfortable and love the pockets!"
"wedding","I was worried about wearing this dress to my family wedding.","I wanted to make sure I could still dance and eat without feeling like everyone could see my food baby in this tight little dress.","Fortunately, this dress is so well made and the fabric is so thick that it hides any and all imperfections.","I loved the simplicity because I wanted to wear wild earrings and the lil cutout was just enough to make it more than your typical plain jane dress.","Not too much skin for the fam either, which was another concern of mine.","It was classy and amazing and I didnt want to return it.","Definitely a little long on me, but I am short and it just made it look classier.","I went braless because it was relatively tight.","Received compliments all night!"
"wedding","I wore this dress to a summer wedding.","The ceremony was in a church and reception was all night dancing and this dress managed to keep up in all aspects.","The lace overlay and length made this dress classic and perfect for the church and the side slits and back gave it just enough spunk for the dance party.","The material of the dress was very comfortable I didnt find myself adjusting or tugging at any point during the day and I was definitely able to bust a move!"
"wedding","Im usually a size 6 to 8.","The medium fit perfectly.","It wasnt too tight and I felt very comfortable.","The color is very bright which I loved.","The lace detail is very pretty."
"wedding","I ordered a size 2 and 4.","At home I only tried on the 4, and it fit, but I decided to bring the 2 with me just in case.","I tried on the 2 at the hotel and realized it actually fit better.","The major difference was that the bust was tighter, which I actually preferred because I was not wearing a bra.","The 2 was also slightly longer for some reason, which was perfect for my shoes.","Added bonus...it was very comfortable for dancing!","I would definitely recommend."
"wedding","I am in love with this dress!!!","The color and fit was AMAZING!!!","I think I might get a 2 next time because my boobs felt a little squished, but not bad at all.","I highly recommend this dress!!","!"
"wedding","I am usually a Medium but I ordered a small as back up and it fit perfectly.","I was able to wear a strapless bra, it was super light and comfortable"
"wedding","Im 57, 34A-28-35, and long-waisted.","Dress was big on top and a bit stretched.","The sticky and elastic didnt hold great, so the over the shoulder hold was very helpful.","Tight on the hips, so Im glad I went with a 4 instead of smaller to fit chest."
"wedding","Received lots of compliments and although I totally loved this dress, it definitely runs small in the rib cage area and its pretty short..especially when worn with heels.","The quality of the material is great but again, Id definitely recommend ordering a size up!"
"wedding","This was a great dress.","The fit and flare shape is super flattering.","I also loved the color, material (which was thicker than expected), and pockets.","Although I had to pin the straps on the dress because they were a bit too long for me,  everything else was perfect.","Highly recommended."
"wedding","#glamorous"
"wedding","I ordered a S & M.  While the M felt comfortably at the chest area, I opted to wear the S even though it was a bit snug.","The S gave me a figure flattering look while the M was a bit boxy.","This is a conservative dress, but paired with accessories its perfect for a wedding.","The material kept me warm enough on a cold fall night."
"wedding","I consistently wear a zero but this dress wouldnt zip around my ribcage/waist!","Sadly, I had to return it without wearing it."
"wedding","This dress comes in S, M or L rather than the 2,4,6,8 etc that is advertised on RTR.","I ordered the 6 (M) and 8 (L) and ended up wearing the L. The difference in the two sizes was in the strap length but the body fit exactly the same.","Great dress for someone with an athletic shape.","The color was stunning and I would definitely rent this dress again.","I wish I could keep it!"
"wedding","I love love love this dress!","I wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments!","A couple girls even saying I was the best dressed guest there!","I paired it with nude heels to match the lace underlay.","I only wish I had a picture of me in it to show how beautiful it really is."
"wedding","Earlier this year I also rented the long sleeve version of this dress and absolutely loved it.","The cut is flattering and since my legs are long I always appreciate a dress that isnt too short.","My boyfriend even said he overheard other guests talking about my dress.","The color is a bit more pink than it looks in photos, but as someone who usually wears black or gray I was actually glad about that.","This dress definitely benefitted from wearing some shapewear underneath just to make sure everything stayed looking smooth.","The only con is that it wrinkles pretty easily and I did have to iron it once I got it in the mail."
"wedding","This dress was pretty true to size, I wear a 6 and it was a tad big in waist so if you have a smaller waste/hourglass figure I would get your normal size and a size down.","The color is way more brilliant than is pictured on the model and I got compliments all night, its a attention getter for sure.","The scalloping on the neckline and the bottom was such an elegant touch and the dress looked very expensive.","I am a 34D so it was a little too chesty with a bra, so I didnt wear one but its nice to know you have the option to go either way.","I would 100% rent it again and when I put photos on facebook, I had 3 people ask me the first day where I got that dress!!!","Dont hesitate, this dress is a winner!"
"wedding","Hard to zip, needed a friends help.","But once I got it on I loved it.","Sucks you in in all the best ways.","Very comfortable.","So many compliments."
"wedding","I am normally a 4 and I went with the small over the medium.","The small was a little tight but I have a small bust and the medium was too big and you cant wear a bra.","It is a little stretchy so I was still comfortable.","I received a lot of compliments and really enjoyed this dress.","There was some minor wear which is why I only gave it 4 stars but i think that was only noticeable to me."
"wedding","This dress was great.","The only thing I wasnt quite prepared for is that the neckline is very wide on your shoulders (i.e.","requires strapless bra, which I hate) however the rest of the dress was awesome and so I went with it and received so many compliments :)"
"wedding","It was great to see family that I havent seen in years to tell me how great I looked in my dress.","The dress hugged in all the right places."
"wedding","A bit too low cut for my normal taste but it was otherwise beautiful and fierce.","The ruching helps hide bumps and imperfections.","The length was formal and demure.","Some of sequins were coming off though."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a vineyard wedding in the Hamptons that was outside in the summer and it was perfect for the occasion.","From the other reviewers, I was a little worried about the fit but the 4R fit perfectly up top...","I could wear a regular bra and it didnt move at all, so no tape required.","The bottom could have been a little longer as I wore 4 heels and I am 57 so maybe should have gone with the 4L, but I still almost stepped on the back of the dress all night so I think that would have been too long.","Overall, beautiful and got compliments all night."
"wedding","I love love love this dress!","I would buy if it ever went on sale.","The halter part was a little tricky with my bra, but nothing a little fashion tape couldnt fix.","Perfect for the summer outdoor LA wedding I wore the dress to; it was comfortable and breezy and surprisingly light weight.","The high-low part of the skirt made me feel cooler and I felt like a princess walking with the back on it (almost like it had a mini train.","Would rent again!"
"work","Loved the bottom of the dress and I adored the menswear inspiration—but the waist is very small (with no give/stretch) compared to the rest of the cut and I couldnt zip it up.","My fault for not ordering a backup size!","The overall quality and material is nicer/heavier in person than what I expected from the pictures."
"work","Lots of compliments on this skirt.","Perfect for work and then dinner and drinks out with a friend that night!"
"work","This dress was prefect to wear to work and also go out later without charming.","Im veey petite,  but even so the length was still pretty flattering.","It was not as tight as the picture,  but still flattering and very comfortable.","I liked the material."
"work","Loved this dress, really flattering cut"
"work","Great dress, nice length, very librarian, sophisticated.","Add a bun and glasses and you are ready to go.","Only complaint was that it is a little panty line revealing.","I wore another dress under it actually that is the same shape but light weight, like a slip almost which helped tremendously!","Great dress."
"work","Received compliments from strangers all day.","Love the unique fabric look and texture.","Pic on model doesnt do it justice."
"work","I styled this very similarly to the model photo.","I didnt look anything like the model, but I still felt very cool-girl.","Its such a unique coat - great for casual Friday.","The fit is pretty true, maybe runs a bit big.","I usually wear a 12 in dresses but can get away with 10s when its a boxier or looser cut.","I didnt snap it closed, but I could have without the pulling being too bad."
"work","The fit was a little large, especially at the waist/belt line.","Overall loved the dress."
"work","The fit is perfect for me.","I have broad shoulders and a large ribcage with a narrow waste.","The dress was very flattering and it wasnt too tight on top.","The color is also nice with my tan."
"work","True to size, good length for work."
"work","This dress looks great and I was excited about wearing it.","However, it cinched at the waist and made it very uncomfortable to wear.","The asymmetric overlay in the bottom would ride up (showing way too much leg for work) because it didnt allow for the waist to move for a more relaxed fit when sitting.","Of course I can only speak for the size I ordered, but Im sure there is no difference in the cut of the dresss symmetry."
"work","I usually wear a 4 but the 6 fit perfect.","I ended up buying this dress.","Its the perfect work dress and the color is amazing."
"work","fits great"
"work","Thin, stretchy crepe material makes for a super flattering fit, even for busty girls.","Fabric isnt super breathable so you may not want to wear it outside/in warm environments.","I didnt absolutely love the print, but its a nice way to work a less girl-y floral into the rotation.","I got lots of compliments about the dress."
"work","This chic dress is great for work or for date night, classy, sexy and very well made.","Its girly, yet edgy and I love that!"
"work","The fit on this is great.","It was a nice cropped length to show off some cute sandals.","The fabric is really comfy yet tailored looking.","I wore it with a belt to show off my waist.","The hardest part about this is how low cut the neckline is.","It was hard to find the right top to put with it.","I ended up going with a plain black cami."
"work","The fabric is thick and cozy, and the texture and side slit add something noteworthy to an otherwise uniform work outfit.","My only complaint is the stretch waistband; it just didnt work on me."
"work","This dress is adorable.","It is low-cut, so I chose to wear a tight black tank top underneath.","I absolutely loved the color, and it just looked perfect for my meeting.","I did notice the material was a little thin - not crazy, cheap thin - but it wasnt a super thick fabric.","That was actually perfect for me as it was very sunny and hot where I was."
"work","This dress is just my style, but unfortunately the hips were HUGE in this dress.","I have very straight and narrow hips so that didnt help, but I am normally a 4-6 in many dresses with no issue.","I found the top to smush my chest, while the hips had several inches of excess fabric.","As others noted, the fabric is VERY thick, I imagine it would be warm, think of a wet suit."
"work","This dress is amazing, I kept getting compliments from everyone.","The material was not as soft as I imagined but once youre wearing it, it is incredibly comfortable while still classy and sexy.","I normally wear a small or size 4, but Im grateful that I read the reviews and requested an MR size as back up.","It still highlighted all the right areas without making me feel too exposed.","Im a 58 height, 34B chest but I do have a behind and my stomach is not as flat as I would like it to be, so medium was the better and more comfortable choice.","Would definitely rent again!","To sum up, if you have an hourglass figure and a bigger chest/behind, definitely go for MR or larger (depending on the chest size).","Also very important, I highly recommend wearing a strapless or stick on bra with this, and a thong, or no lines panties."
"work","This was another dress that looks a lot better in person!","the pics do not do it justice.","The fabric is really colorful.","I paired it with gold jewelry and a bright orange scarf..."
"work","Awesome.","Comfortable.","Love it.","Nice stretchy fabric."
"work","Perfect fit."
"work","The dress has a great stretch to it, very comfortable.","I got so many compliments.","I would purchase this dress and keep it forever if I could."
"work","I really liked this top, the flowy material was just enough on the side.","It was a little small for my bust but still fit well."
"work","Rented an XS, as the reviews said it ran large.","Fit me perfectly; Im 52 and normally a size 4/6.","It was a bit low-cut for work, but the tie covered up the cleavage so it wasnt a problem.","Cute print and nice blue color."
"work","Got this with my Unlimited Subscription.","I received compliments all day.","It is feminine,  classy, and well made."
"work","Very fitted around wrists and neck.","The collar detail does not appear to be refined in person.","It has a light floral pattern.","I would have preferred a collar that was solid white.","The material is thick and stretchy, which really hugs my curves.","However, the weather was way too warm to truly enjoy the dress so I didnt wear it."
"work","I loved this jump suit so much!","The material was very high quality and it was SO comfortable.","Im 55 and it wasnt quite as cropped on me as the picture.","It hit right around my ankle.","Also, since I wore it to wore, I wore a cami underneath for modesty.","Definitely recommend!!","!"
"work","This top of this dress is not leather in the back so it was easier to move around in than other full leather tops.","It fit nicely and looked nice with a button down shirt under it.","Perfect for work, I would rent it again."
"work","I wore this to an outdoor work event and then out for dinner with my husband.","Got lots of compliments: its a fun and unique dress and I think it could work for a lot of occasions.","Nice if you want to dress up but not look too, too dressy.","I am usually a size four and wore the four.","The size two fit but was a bit snug in the ribcage and waist, and also the slip was hanging down past the hem so I would have needed to tape it if I wanted to wear it."
"work","This dress is super lightweight material, which means that you can easily wear tights and sweaters and jackets t layer it up.","There is a great little cut out over the left leg.","It gives it a bit of personality in the cut.","Lots of compliments on this dress."
"work","I really liked the fabric of this dress...its actually constructed with a bunch of triangular panels, which is a nice detail and elevates it from being a basic black lace dress.","My only complaint is that the neckline is slightly gappy...I had to use some double-sided dress tape to get it to stay down and not show my bra, which didnt hold up for the entire day."
"work","Dressy fabric and a little bit of a low back for a work dress.","Would have been perfect for an informal wedding.","Perfect length and I’m very short waisted, but it worked for me.","Color was a dark salmon.","Would seriously consider purchasing this dress.","So many compliments!"
"work","Fits perfectly, has a really nice, professional, structured look but with the sleeveless arms, feels youthful"
"work","This is a nice dress for work and seemed to be relatively good quality, but nothing particularly notable or special about it.","My one complaint is that the lining kind of rode up at one point, which lifted the flaps of the dress up in the back.","I had to pay attention throughout the day to make sure that didnt happen again."
"work","I wore this to my work Christmas party, which was also celebrating their 10 year anniversary so I had to have a formal dress.","The sleeves around the arms were not tight, which was nice with dancing and hugging people when greeting them.","Im taller than most girls but the length of the dress on me was perfect so I wasnt tripping over it all night."
"work","This dress was a dash big for me, but I was able to make it work.","The material is nice and thick, very structured, but comfortable.","I got lots of compliments on the print of this dress!","I wish the hemline was shorter, but I am pretty petite."
"work","I love the color of this dress.","Generally with these types of knit dresses, I worry that the skirt is too wide, but this one flowed nicely.","The chest was a bit tight and showed my bra lines which I had to cover with a blazer."
"work","Fit as expected.","Perfect for the office."
"work","I am a DVF girl inside and out, however, this dress just didnt do it for me.","It runs large, and since it is not a wrap dress, it was hard to make fit right.","The fabric is lovely, but this style is not for the every day wearer."
"work","Not a huge fan of the flare from  the waist.","It doesnt hug hips bu rather makes them look bigger.","if you have narrow hips - its a great way to add curves, but if your hips are on the bigger side to begin with  then its not flattering."
"work","This dress was ok.","Colors are pretty and the fit is comfortable but either you need to wear a tank under it or pin it at the chest.","I pinned it but then bust felt a bit tight then."
"work","I sized up one as its tough to have a wrap dress fit a large bust and be modest, but overall fit was great.","The cut is beautiful and its a great classic look for work or a party.","I would say in person the coloring is different than Id thought - background is the same hot pink as pictured but up close its red and yellow flowers on black lattice.","I didnt think the colors up close look great together which is the only reason I didnt rate it higher."
"work","I got a lot of compliments on this dress.","The dress is simple, but elegant.","I could see it being great for daytime and nighttime wear."
"work","This dress is really feminine and pretty.","I wore to work with brown heels and received a ton of compliments.","I was worried it wouldnt arrive with the belt as others who received before said they didnt receive it.","The dress is big and shapeless without the belt.","I will probably rent this dress again."
"work","I rented this dress for a work function and did not end up wearing it.","What the picture fails to show is that the top part of the dress is an overlay of thick cotton fabric from the neckline to bust.","It is a matching pattern, but different stiff fabric with a thick zipper in the back.","The best way to describe the fit is just odd, confusing and a contradiction of fashion elements.","Not the charming classic summer gingham dress I originally thought it would be."
"work","Beautiful dress that fit like a glove and received many compliments.","I liked it so much I wore it to both a meeting and a work event within 2 weeks."
"work","Couldnt wear this dress.","Didnt realize how tight the dress would fit on my athletic body."
"work","I am 53 and this skirt did not flatter my body type."
"work","It was professional, but with an edge.","I wore a blazer over it since I had a work meeting.","The dress fits snugly and cinches the waist nicely.","It could definitely also work for a nice dinner."
"work","I love how you can make the belt as tight as you want and I actually really enjoyed the low-cut neckline since Im not too busty.","Overall, a very chic dress."
"work","Perfect length and weight for a Fall day at work."
"work","I usually wear a medium in this style clothing, however, this size M was too large for me.","A nice piece tho."
"work","im typically a 2 in rebecca taylor but since this is fitted at the waist i went w the 4 and it was perfect and comfortable for wearing all day.","the sleeves are my fav part, flirty, but subtle.","i love the nude slip under and the details of this dress.","i didnt bother wearing a bra, but cldve easily worn a black one.","hit a touch above the knee, great w tights.","highly recommend!"
"work","I am a 4-6 in a dress and am REALLY glad I got this in a 6.","It was the correct size but is very structured; do not size down if in doubt.","Great color, great cut, not my favorite for photos sitting down since it rides up but great for any other scenario."
"work","Great dress if you want to step it up a bit for work!","It would be awesome for a night out as well.","I received many compliments on this dress.","Its clingy without being too revealing, and the rouching hides any little flaws.","Stretchy and comfortable, too."
"work","Fit very nicely since I have wide shoulders/upper torso and always find things to snug in underarm area.","Got a lot of compliments from family and coworkers."
"work","The rise was a little too short and the snap closure for the top was a bit precarious.","But it was stylish, in an 80s sort of way, and Id definitely wear it to a cocktail party or lounge setting.","Not really appropriate for a conservative workplace, though."
"work","The blazer does run big.","Id suggest ordering a size or two smaller.","I have broad shoulders and it was still big.","The blazer will go with just about anything and its light weight so perfect for spring/summer nights"
"work","This dress fits like a glove.","I put it on as my first unlimited delivery, and my partner said can you buy that?!","I felt wonderful and am thrilled to start off with Rent the Runway Unlimited on such a great note."
"work","Perfect black minimalist skirt for work and date night!","Im glad it arrived new with the tags still on as it made the RTR discount well worth it.","Id say the 8 is closer to non-vanity sizing, as many higher end lines adhere too.","I take a smaller size in some other brands so Im glad I decided to size up on this as a 6 wouldve been too small.","The length was good on me, longer than on the model since Im a shortie but still a great length.","The shorter piece is above the knee while the longer piece fell over my knee.","I was wearing it a little higher on the waist as Im probably between a 10 and an 8 but in the process of losing weight so the 8 will sit nicely higher for now and Ill let it hang lower as I lose and eventually will have a tailor nip it in.","Its such amazing quality, no VPL and a nice weight.","This will be a great skirt to rent either for you business attire needs or even for evening with a bare or glam top."
"work","Heavier fabric than it looks."
"work","Asymmetrical cut.","Beautiful silk.","I wore it with black pants, heels and a jacket for a presentation.","One important detail that I missed is that the print has womens legs coming out of the flowers...","It was fine for the group I was meeting with, but a more conservative crowd might not have loved that :)"
"work","I may have ordered the wrong size when I went with the 36, so it fit very snug in the shoulders and chest.","Size 36 is probably more like a true size 0 and I need 2 with room in the chest.","Just beware it has zero stretch.","The print and color is beautiful, fabric is thick and lined so definitely work appropriate, which is where I wore it."
"work","Colorful dress I tried out as part of RTR unlimited - the cutout at the front is lower than I expected and I had to layer with a cami.","Would I rent again: NoCompliments:0Styling: I wore it with hair down and a neutral lip, but think this would look good with a bold lip as well."
"work","It fits perfect!","I havent had it long but have worn it a few times already.","I plan to keep it awhile longer in thc closet or just buy it.",":)"
"work","This Cut 25 Brush of Burgundy dress in 6 is purple and has short sleeves with a crew neckline and is a full skirt.","This dress is for someone who has a larger brest.","This dress is  too heavy for me.","The body type that should wear this dress is someone who is tall.","This dress as a back zipper with an hook-eye closure."
"work","This jacket really brightened up a plain LBD.","Great for work.","Will rent again."
"work","Given the pattern, I believed this would be very slimming, but in fact it was not all that flattering.","It was nice, but I wouldnt rent it again."
"work","A little fancy for work, but with thick black tights it was fine.","The 4 fit nicely for the office.","If I was wearing it elsewhere I might have wanted a 2.","The material is really nice and its lined which is an added bonus.","I probably wouldnt recommend it for a warmer day.","The train is a little more dramatic than it looks in person but I loved it and would rent it again for a cocktail party."
"work","I adored this dress, one of my favorite rentals yet.","I am pear-shaped and found the 8 was form fitting and still had a little room to spare if I found myself feeling bloated after a long day (I rented this dress for a weekend-long training course in NYC, 8 hours straight working and no issues).","Perfect fabric for summer weather."
"work","nothing really special about this dress."
"work","I wore this for a work event luncheon and I fit in while still standing out.","Its a very unique pattern and generally speaking its very cute.","The con was that the fit was slightly off for me - tight in my arms and I had to be careful about the length because its very short."
"work","This shirt is extremely flattering.","Because I am petite (53) I am always having difficulty with the fit of clothing.","This shirt was perfect.","It was a great length (came just below my hips) and i got so many compliments at work.","I am usually a 6 or 8 (150lbs with my weight distributed everywhere.. my arms a little big) and the 6 was perfect."
"work","Perfect every day dress for work.","Subtle pattern dressed it up a bit.","This was too long, though (below the knee on me).","Slightly less awkward with high pumps but would have been nice in a petite.","Flattering fit and not too tight."
"work","So the blazer is very cute.","I love the back, and it looks great with a nice work dress.","My only concern was the front as the fit was quite loose.","And I suppose it would have to be loose with the open back.","I should have thought of that.","I honestly think this jacket would be great if I carried my weight in the waist.","Alas, I do not and that is not my style - so it didnt work for me.","When I am pregnant, though, I am running to the store to try to buy this jacket.","It would be absolutely perfect for a baby bump!","Thats the kind of loose Im talking about."
"work","One of my fave rentals.","Perf dress to go from office to a night out.","Super flattering.","Got tons of compliments."
"work","by design, its missing the last bottom at the bottom.","i often found my self flashing people.","quite embarrassing.","youll need to have a safety pin readily available for this one.","also, the buttons in general are set apart.","have another pin for your breast area, if you are large breasted, you will have a gap here, too."
"work","I rented this for work and wore it with black tights and heeled loafers.","I felt like it was just a smidge too short, and it might have been better with flats for work.","That said, it would be very cute with nude heels for a non-work event.","The ruffle in the front and back does give the illusion that the skirt is a bit longer than it really is.","The skirt under the ruffle was form-fitting, and I found the neck to pull a bit and felt tight when sitting, but there was plenty of stretch in the arms and chest.","The body-side of the skirt is lined with a silky material, so it tended to hike up a bit when I walked.","The color is gorgeous, and looked very nice with my complexion, so I would definitely rent again, but probably not for the office.","This piece would be better for a cocktail party or an event where I was going to be spending more time standing than sitting."
"work","I have no cons with this gem.","The material is fantastic, super smooth and comfortable.","The jacket moves well, looks good buttoned or open and the color is great.","Overall wonderful.","I would love to buy it."
"work","Well made, bright colors, very flattering.","Compliments galore."
"work","Work appropriate length, Im 411 and it hit right at my knee.","I knew it was a loose fitting dress so I gave it some shape with a belt.","The dress had a nice V neck but not too low for work."
"work","Im so glad I looked up this brands size charts before renting.","Its British, which tends to run smaller, so youll likely have to size up for the perfect fit.","The pattern is so pretty, and despite not being lined, not see through at all.","Loved wearing this to work on a warmer winter day with black tights and booties."
"work","This dress is definitely work-appropriate.","It looks short on the model, but I did not find the length troubling.","I feel that its true-r to size than some of the other rentals Ive had.","Do it!"
"work","It was too short for work without tights but it looked perfect with them!","The dress was a perfect fit for me.","The straps for the slip are really close to the shoulders though so that took a bit of getting used to."
"work","This dress is a very vibrant orange/red depending on what you pair it with.","I originally rented it for work but ending up wearing it to a christmas party because it was definitely not appropriate at my work setting.","If you have any curve then it is several inches shorter than it shows on the model.","The V neck was a little high and did not show off a ton a cleavage which I liked.","The material was very stretchy and comfortable."
"work","This dream is so versatile.","I wore it for an important work meeting but also wore it to an engagement party.","The ruffle detail on the bottom of the dress is so feminine and fun.","It ran true to size and fit really well."
"work","Wore it to work - cute dress!"
"work","I wore it for the exhibition with the pair of high heels and it looked simple but elegant."
"work","Good, classic black sweater with a little funkiness with the front pockets.","Its VERY warm, that high right turtleneck keeps the heat in, but its comfortable to wear.","Make sure youre not going through the change if youre going to wear it, the only way to escape the heat is to pull it up under your chin (NSFW)."
"work","Longer than expected and wool - definitely not meant to be worn during summer months."
"work","interesting texture; tight in the arms"
"work","Fit nice.","Was a little long but heals helped a lot.","The collar started getting annoying when I put my phone in my pocket.","I suppose it drags the dress in a funny way.","Very comfortable on a hot night.","Could wear a bra with black straps and it was well hidden.","Overall very happy with this dress and would rent again."
"work","im typically a 4, but ordered a 2 thinking it was more of a shift dress, but it is actually fitted at the waist.","i can wear the dress, but it is def tighter than i prefer so when i order again i will opt for a 4. it does hit almost mid thigh for me so tall gals beware.","easy to wear with any undergarment.","highly recommend for spring/summer, very very cute"
"work","Fit was great; not too tight but hugged in the right spots.","Conservative with length, sleeves, chest = great work attire."
"work","im typically btwn 2 and 4, usually a 4 in bcbg.","the 4 fit great, very comfortable and room for dinner and a show.","loved the delicate lace on the shoulder and the slightly open back.","its very flowy and beautiful, has pockets, and is very light.","im rather short so it hit right below the knee.","wld be better for someone taller, but i wore heels and didnt mind.","i didnt end up wearing a bra, but you cldve worn a thin strapped bra without taking away from the look.","i highly highly recommend this dress!"
"work","I had to buy this dress.","The scuba material was slimming and smoothed my figured - making me look long and lean.","Its a gorgeous dress and perfect to wear from day to night.","I threw a turtleneck on for the office and peeled if off for happy hour.","Lovely."
"work","I loved the color, the cut.","Had to wear with a cami underneath."
"work","Nothing negative to write about the fit--fit perfectly.","Fabric is light, and even though the dress is pretty simple, the color adds an X factor.","I got compliments all day and I would rent again!"
"work","This dress had more of stretch jean look to it that I was not expecting, my husband really liked it on me but at the end of the day I wasnt feeling it so I sent it back.","Its true to size and that wasnt an issue at all, just wasnt me."
"work","It ran incredibly large, was unflattering and the pants had such a wide leg it looked clownish."
"work","I took this photo after I removed my spanx for the night, so its a little less flattering ;), but overall this dress was great.","It was mod and cute for work, with bell sleeves.","It was a perfect fit (with the spanx) for my curvy 14 figure, and I liked the length - short enough to be sexy, but just (barely) long enough to wear to work.","I wore it to work (Im an interior decorator), and to two happy hour events after work, and then to my in-laws 40th wedding anniversary at their dance studio.","It stood up all all those busy events in one day, and was fine for dancing in."
"work","I love these pants.","First, I received all of the compliments.","Second, I received ALL of the compliments.","The fit is very true to size but if you are thinking between two, grab the larger ones.","Great for warm weather but with fall coloring.","A great transition piece."
"work","Absolutely loved this piece.","When I wore it with jeans, it looked sporty.","When I wore it with black trousers for work it looked professional.","Absolutely love and will be renting again."
"work","I wore this to work, and received compliments all day.","Currently I am between a size 8 and 10, and I went with a size  10 in this style because of the skirt.","I had plenty of room up top, and was very comfortable with the fit of the bottom as well.","A size 8 may have been snug on the bottom since I have hips and thighs.","I do recommend fashion tape for the top, especially if you are fuller busted, as the top can gape open without a little help.","Really unique and cool style!"
"work","This dress is really comfortable.","Its simple but the pattern gives it a little something extra."
"work","This is such a unique piece from ADEAM!","The style is a LBD with flare.","The back folds and then ties to create an awesome structured train.","It runs true to size and I would recommend sizing up for your back up.","It is fitted at the natural waste and flared at the bottom which give comfortable room at the hips.","The fabric has no stretch and at 510 the lowest part was above my knees.","Dress this style up or down!"
"work","A twist on a simple silhouette because of the texture!","This dress is definitely versatile for most body types because it is comfortable in the bust, the material is stretchy, and roomy in the hips!","On top of that, you can wear this with a standard bra.","Not only is it easy to wear, but the fit is slimming and can be worn to work, a wedding, or any event where you dont want to wear anything too bright!"
"work","A flattering style for smaller torsos and wider hips.","An attention grabber.","Just a wee tight in the chest for 34C and maybe the length a bit too long past the knee (and I am 510).","But, overall, I felt very confident in the dress, a classic shape, and would rent again, even buy it.","Received many compliments."
"work","Beautiful!","Felt so pretty walking down the street in this flowing dress.","Warning it is sheer and best with a slip for work."
"work","Fit is great, dress is warm, and the dress kept its shape the whole day.","Would definitely rent again!"
"work","I liked this dress because it was a bit different than what I normally wear and I really enjoyed it.","I got a ton of compliments.","I would recommend this for work or a trade show - which is what I wore it to."
"work","So pretty but I couldnt get the slip on over my 2nd trimester belly."
"work","Not a show-stopper but a worthy work dress.","Great material: heavy and wrinkle-free.","Flattering fit, with flexibility on the waist line due to tie-back feature.","Color pops, I recommend this dress for all my red-headed friends out there :)"
"work","Overall, its a cute jacket that can be worn both inside and outside.","The fit was just too large on me, and it was much longer on me than on the model.","It hit my lower to mid-thigh.","From the picture, I assumed the jacket was green, white, and navy, but it is actually green, white, and black.","Overall, its cute and fun, but rent a size down!"
"work","Highly recommend!","I would rent this again for a spring work event."
"work","Super cute - ruffle details do not continue onto back of dress; runs slightly smaller -- wear 6/8 and the large was form fitting"
"work","This was a fun dress to wear with a flirty hem.","The cut and shape was not what I would usually wear but it fit well and I received a lot of compliments.","I wore this with a black blazer over it."
"work","I wasnt sure about this dress at first but it has grown on me.","It is not a slimming design, however, the color is very pretty, the shoulder details are super cute, it hides tummy issues, it is so comfy and it has pockets!","I would say it runs large.","Definitely size down 1 size.","My chest is 36 DDD and I had lots of room so big chested girls this dress will surely work for you.","I wore a racer back bra which is perfect in the front but did show in the back.","It was okay because my long hair hid it.","The fabric has a nice weight to it and it is lined with a built in slip.","I would say you can dress this up or down.","It would look great with sandals for brunch or heels for a reception or party."
"work","Not sure why this top has so many negative reviews.","Sure, its not form-fitting, but it is flowy and feminine.","I liked it and wore it to work.","The colors are pretty and the fit was great with pencil pants.","Was great for everyday."
"work","Loved this jacket!","Beautiful fabric and drape.","Will definitely rent again."
"work","Fits true to size.","Love the stretchy pieces on the inside of the arm which makes the jacket more form fitting yet comfortable."
"work","Im 52 and this was pretty short on me - Im usually a 00 and i got a size 8 which fit perfect - i suggest sizing up."
"work","A little loose."
"work","Im short so the sleeves were a tad long, but not so that I felt awkward wearing the jacket.","I have broad shoulders and typically where a size 6 in work jackets/blazers.","I wore w/jeans for work and I received compliments on the outfit.","I would order this jacket again and wear to work.","You could also dress it up."
"work","cute skirt"
"work","I always wear a 12 in DVF, but this dress runs big.","Luckily its thick but quite stretchy so it still fits fairly well even though I would have gone down a size if I had time.","Im large chested and was worried but this dress is very flattering.","Id wear it again."
"work","I rented this dress to tape the national pledge breaks for Downton Abbey on PBS, so I had very specific needs--I couldnt have anything low cut, white or black or patterned.","I needed a way that a microphone could be clipped on, so nothing backless, and I wanted sleeves because of personal preference.","To say that this was limiting would be an understatement!","This dress fit the bill--I sized up because I had a 1-inch thick microphone pack on my back, but otherwise, the 4R would probably have worked.","The only thing that I would have changed was that the ruching across the tummy, while flattering when standing around, looked wrinkled on camera.","I, and more importantly, my producer, was happy with this dress!"
"work","True to size.","The material is thick and is noticeably worn so the pockets, which are usually a plus for me, sagged.","The liner of the dress peeps out from under the dress (as seen in the pic) so I was constantly pulling up the liner.","Not the best experience but still overall was an excellent outfit that looked pulled together and professional.","I wore a silk ivory blouse underneath the dress for that pulled together look."
"work","I wore this to 2 job interviews, one work meeting and on a casual date night with jeans.","I love that it is lightweight and Chanel-esque - comes across as both playful and professional.","If I ordered it again I *might* go a size up to the 6 but thats because I like to be able to close a jacket completely when I wear it so I dont feel like Im stuffed into it.","It looked totally fine in the current size Im wearing which is a 4."
"work","I LOVED this piece!","I kept it for a while so that I could mix it into my summer wardrobe.","I loved it over a shortsleeved white scoop neck tee and denim of any color really.","So stylish with the belted waist.","I didnt wear it alone as a dress, as there is a stitched detail that is actually see through, and not quite long enough to be appropriate.","But if you are on the shorter side, you may be able to pull that off."
"work","The fit was great.","I was afraid the chest area would be a little restrictive but the sizing worked out well.","The dress has such playful details (pussycat bow and piping) but is still polished enough for work.","Will definitely rent again!"
"work","Great print for summer!","Fit was nice and great for work!"
"work","Can go serious for work with a more conservative blazer, or for a night out with a fun top- very versatile"
"work","Cute dress, but I felt it did run small.","I had the XS and may have felt more comfortable in a S.  Heavy weight knit.","Would easily work with tights in the fall.","Got several compliments.","Would rent again."
"work","This is an adorable classic and simple dress.","Plan to pair it with a statement necklace or a fun blazer.","It runs a bit small, but not enough to merit ordering a size up.","A few things to caution: 1) its a bit on the short side (and thats coming from someone whos 52) and 2) the material causes it to wrinkle big time.","After wearing for a few hours, youll have some heavy wrinkles in the front area from sitting.","The navy color makes it less noticeable, but still something to be aware of."
"work","Perfect for a step above daily work clothes- Worn for a presentation and dinner and drinks after- felt stellar in this!"
"work","Lots of compliments when wearing."
"work","Loved it.","Small through the chest...","I was unable to button it all the way so I wore a tan cami under with a cool long necklace!","It was super cute!","Wish I would have taken a picture!"
"work","Can definitely size down.","Very roomy and waist is stretchy."
"work","Nice puffy sleeves add a bit of details to the loose shift shape.","I wore with booties and kept it simple"
"work","This dress is very professional looking and polished.","Fit is a little boxy - snug in the bust and roomy in the waist."
"work","I loved the color and fit of the dress.","Super flattering for an athletic build and long enough to wear to work (with a sweater over it, because the front cuts in a bit).","Would be more fun to wear to an event thats not super dressy.","But ORDER UP A SIZE!","Im pretty much always a 2, and even though I could get it on, it was super tight, particularly up top (and I have a tiny ribcage).","Also, I know a few other folks have complained about the zipper, but it was so bad that I actually couldnt close the last few inches (and it wasnt because I didnt have room to).","Both my boyfriend and I tried.","I would love trying to rent again in a size 4, but am weary considering I couldnt get the zipper closed last time..."
"work","Very flattering.","I have broad shoulders that I feel make me look heavier than I am.","This dress with the perfect neckline and sleeve combination is slimming."
"work","Material is so comfortable, felt great all day."
"work","a bit baggy as other reviews say, had to pin them"
"work","It is SUPER thin.","But a cute work dress with tights and a sweater.","I was just surprised how thin the material was."
"work","I rented this for a work event and it fit like a glove.","It was sophisticated and the peplum gave it such a fun twist.","Lots of compliments with this one and will rent again!"
"work","I wore this dress to work.","The pattern is very pretty and the cut is work appropriate.","The material is thinner so it is great for warmer weather, but if you have a cold office you might need a jacket or sweater.","I would definitely consider re-renting in the summer."
"work","So flattering.","The picture makes the top look almost grey, but it is a very thin blue and white stripe.","Fit is amazing and there is a fun ruffle at the bottom."
"work","By design, its intended to be loose so I recommend going down a size.","I loved this - the color was vibrant and fun, great for work.","I wore a tank top underneath it.","I have a long torso and my belly was showing anytime I moved around."
"work","I loved this dress.","I thought it was just black and white but it has little hints of pink in it which made it fun!","I love the bow in the back.","Several individuals said that it was tight in the arms...","I didnt think it was but then again I am really flat chested so it probably made it easier for it to fit on top.","The dress was of a heavier material so i would suggest not wearing it to an outside summer time affair.","I would order this dress again!"
"work","Nothing short of OBSESSED with this top.","It was nice and fitted in the rib cage, but then flared out a bit at the tummy, so ultimately was really comfortable while looking super high fashion and chic.","Dont be intimidated by the sleeves and tuxedo-like longer hem in the back - it feels just like wearing a tailored shirt, just with a bit more flair, for those days when you want to spice it up a bit (perfect for transitioning from a work to date b/c its both strong and beautiful).","I wound up wearing  it with leather pants (like it was shown on the runway) to mix a bit of edge with the sweet pattern."
"work","Fitted over the hips so pear shaped women should size up and realize that the pockets fall over the hips, so the dress does not really slim you."
"work","Lots of complements.","Wore for presentation at work...stunning.","Will rent again"
"work","Loved the fit and color.","Perfect for the Kick it up a notch work day."
"work","I wore this dress to the office for casual office wear.","Cute, comfy, and the material was soft on the skin.","I got compliment on the dress which is always a plus!","The large pockets held my Galaxy 7 Edge so that was great because I get sick of carrying around my phone or having to have a purse.","Note: under the armpits was a bit big on me (probably due to smaller chest and/or pear shaped body bottom an 8 and tops a 6) so I wore a jean jacket over the top to hide the gap in space between the material and my body."
"work","Received as a backup for a dress I wore to a shower so I wore this to work that week instead.","Wore a white cardigan over the arms, as the square shape of the top showed my bra (maybe could have gone with a strapless, but it was also chilly out).","Was nervous about how the cut at the waist would look on me (I cant wear pepulm or anything fun like that) but it actually looked good!"
"work","It was very comfortable... not bodycon, but not baggy or oversized.","Loved the print, very festive.","I wore it to work and then out.","Would definitely rent again."
"work","Received many compliments.","Dress runs a bit large.","The structure of dress is divine, stylish and professional with a flair of sophistication."
"work","Simple black dress for casual work event."
"work","Wore with a half cardigan for work.","Very comfortable and flattering.","I love the watercolor look of the pattern."
"work","The cut of this dress is perfect and the detail on the neckline is very beautiful.","My only complaint is this is a jean wash linen fabric and it wrinkles the second you put it on.","So if you will be doing a lot of sitting I wouldnt recommend as it will not look crisp throughout the day/night."
"work","Would definitely order the 0 if it were available.","Think this would look better on a taller lady!"
"work","Perfect dress for work, got compliments all day.","Loved the feminine tiered skirt that hit right at the knee.","Size 10 worked great for me in the bust area (I always need to size up when there are buttons...and Im a nursing mom), but Im normally a size 8.","I wouldnt hesitate to rent this dress again or to buy it."
"work","This dress fit great and was perfect for work.","I love the fun pink color too!"
"work","Cute and easy to wear.","Dressier than it appears online with satin finishes on the bottom.","The zipper is a silver color on the back but its sturdy and holds up."
"work","great fit."
"work","Love it.","A little tight at the hips but the cape at the back makes it less obvious.","Would rent again but probably go a size up."
"work","Fits great, super comfortable and chic"
"work","Didnt realize that the tank would be in a separate hanger and ended up wearing my own black tank.","Fit well and was loose enough in the right place.","Wore it to work and can easily wear this out to a dinner of for drinks.","Will definitely rent this again."
"work","so cute!","im 58 so it was a little short on me but perfect with tights.","would not have been able to wear without tights however."
"work","Great cut and material.","Loved it."
"work","It fits great, is put together very well, and is sophisticated."
"work","The skirt was a great,  business appropriate length, and the fun details made it a little less formal.","Be aware that this is quite form-hugging, although very flattering"
"work","The dress didnt stay closed enough at the top or bottom.","My arms back and waist are quite small so a size up would have been too big and likely too long.","The fit of the 4 seemed to be made for a longer torso and small breasts.","The bottom poked out significantly over my lower half and didnt wrap as much as i would have liked in the front.","Be warned: this is dress is also easily caught by wind.","Could be fun...?"
"work","Very cute!","But the bottom was all black, not periwinkle."
"work","Didnt love this dress at first but grew to as the day wore on and the compliments piled up.","Runs small so it was tight around the only fitted part, slightly above the waist.","The wrap has a button on the inside, a snap outside, and a belt to tie it together.","The snap kept coming undone but the button and belt held it in place well enough.","Had to wear it with a cami because it was so open at the chest that theres no way you could wear it without something underneath.","All those issues might have been resolved by sizing up.","That said, still a modern twist on a beautiful classic-style dress.","Very unique and got lots of compliments from compete strangers."
"work","This dress was not one of my favorites but still did the job.","Its quite body con so it molds to you (which can be appealing or not depending on your body shape!).","The colors are bright, which is also a personal preference thing.","Overall a good choice and would recommend i"
"work","Dress fits like a dream.","I love DVF wrap dresses.","Im a true size 0 for DVF and these fit slightly tighter than other size 0s.","The top was a little snug, although it still worked well for me and the sleeves were quite narrow.","You would also want to wear a full slip with this dress as the split in the skirt can get quite wide when you sit or walk."
"work","The print and styling are awesome.","I wore it to work and received many compliments.","Beware, the dress does open up in odd places.","I actually had to put small stitches at the bust and at the hem from keeping it from bursting open.","I also work a pair of shorts underneath since the dress is quite short.","Despite all this, I loved wearing it."
"work","Fit is perfect.","Flows and comfortable- short and cute but not too short for the office.","Thought the float sleeves would get on the way but not at all."
"work","Really pretty and flattering dress.","The blue is so nice in person.","I wore it to work with a chunky necklace."
"work","This jacket has a unstructured cut - I wore it with a loose button down and form fitting pants.","It looked good"
"work","I paired with white culotte trousers and a brown leather hobo bag for a very chic work look.","I received lots of compliments on this top!","The only complaint I have is the bow was not on the blouse.","It was kinda tucked away in black bag in the garment bag.","So I didnt see it till later and didnt have it for my look.","I wish they would have put it through the belt loops.","If you are rushing to get dressed, you can easily miss it the way they pack it.","Would have been much more cute with it!"
"work","It was nice and short the way I like my dresses, sort of boxy in the middle but I like that!"
"work","This did not fit on me like it looks on the model.","It was large and the slit much higher then I thought it would be.","It had a boxy look to it.","I did not end up wearing it."
"work","This jumpsuit is just perfection.","It is great to wear in the office since it gets a bit chilly and lets face it, it looks pretty cool.","It fits so nicely and comfortably.","This is something I would rent again."
"work","Great dress for women with smaller waist and larger hips"
"work","I read all the reviews and knew this would run a large on me, but rented it anyway for a conference when I knew Id be on the move and need to be comfortable.","The color is a beautiful pop of blue.","The top definitely served the purpose, but the fit was no ideal on my (somewhat) petite frame.","Recommend it, but probably would not rent again."
"work","Beautiful dress for work but I felt self conscious all day and wore a cardigan the majority of the day, even when it was warm out.","If I rent it again I would size up."
"work","This dress is absolutely wonderful.","Its tight in the ribcage area, but otherwise perfect.","The asymmetrical cut gives it a very unique look.","I received so many compliments.","I paired it with navy pantyhose and boots just below the knee.","I buttoned it the entire way, but I think you could definitely have a more casual look with a few buttons undone and still look sophisticated.","I highly recommend this dress and will rent it again."
"work","Super soft and very pretty!"
"work","I wore this shirt four times before returning.","Absolutely loved the draped cut, open back, and wider sleeves.","I wore this both to a work conference, out to drinks and dinner, and again for brunch.","Would absolutely purchase this to own."
"work","WOW so I ordered this on a whim (its not really my style) and I got SO many compliments on it.","The picture does not do it justice.","It cinches in the back and hugged my figure so well.","I was constantly stopped and asked if I was wearing 2 different dresses, and when I told them it was one I was always asked where I got it.","I just styled it with big hoops and sandals for work, it was breezy and fun.","Definitely want to rent again!"
"work","I would have preferred a size smaller as it felt a bit baggy in the waist area."
"work","The color was nice, and the fit was comfortable and flattering."
"work","This is a great dress!"
"work","Wore this to work on two occassions, both times with black tights and black flat boots, and some sort of black cardigan (either drapey or normal fit) over it.","Fit true to size, although if you want more of the baggy shift dress look Id size up, especially if you are very curvy.","Im a 36A with average size hips and I had a comfortable amount of room in the 10, but if I was any bigger at either of my curves it would have been snug, and not very shift like."
"work","Great quality, style, and color, just longer than pictured.","It went to on the knee."
"work","Im  returning this without wearing it.","Im a size 10/12 in clothes but ordered the 14 because I figured the dress would run small.","Small is an understatement.","There is no way this is a 14.","Maybe a small 12.","It was snug all over & the bust wouldnt even close.","It looked a little worn & there was some kind of whitish stain on the front of the dress.","Disappointing for my very first Unlimited Rental."
"work","The arms were a little snug, and the side that is cut straight was a little too short, it kept creeping up a little past work appropriate when I was sitting down (and Im short)!"
"work","Because pretty much every gal freaks for a dress with pockets - this dress is a winner.","I was worried it would look too western but its super cute on.","I got tons of compliments - wish I could buy it!","Very comfortable and appropriate for a huge work conference.","Dressed up yet laid back.","My only gripe was I felt like it was well worn and the fabric a little faded.","For all you (new) working moms - I was able to figure out how to pump in this dress (in private mind you).","Not super easy but not as impossible as with other dresses, so thats a huge win."
"work","Pros: Looks great, feels well made and so comfortable.","Cons: Runs a little big, arms are a bit too short for my frameThis blazer is not white!","It is more of a cream color, just FYI.","I loved the feel of this blazer and felt it was a great rental!","Its so on-trend that you could wear it to work, but also to happy hour after and not look stuffy."
"work","I love DVF -- her wrap dresses are very flattering for pear shapes like myself.","Its a very comfortable material and great to wear for a long day.","I wore it with leggings and ankle boots.","Very true to size, and a stretchy material."
"work","The color is very nice, but ran very big.","Especially in the full skirt and arm holes.","I shouldve ordered the 6."
"work","Loved this dress!","Super comfy & it had pockets!","True to size with  extra room around the waist."
"work","Found this to be an awkward length with the added flare/volume in the skirt.","It just made my shape not look great despite fitting well."
"work","this top fit perfectly, and is very high quality.","I will definitely rent again."
"work","Pros: beautiful colors, figure flattering, perfect for a woman confident with her curves Con- much too showy for work or even a date with my husband, if you are well endowed youll need fashion tape or a cami Wish I could wear it, perfect for someone a little more brave"
"work","I did pull the tabs tighter on the sides of the dress and that did give a little emphasis to my waist / figure.","I feel like this is the perfect work dress and I may not return it!"
"work","I will rent this guy again.","A great standard work dress with a little flare at the bottom.","Just enough curves to make you feel human, but not work inappropriate."
"work","Like most Equipment shirts, this one runs big.","I normally would wear a Small, but I know that Equipment fits me best in XS.","I wore this shirt with slim black pants, but its definitely versatile and would look great with a lot of different outfits."
"work","Hangs very well and material is thick and perfect for fall.","The sleeves add a lot of interest and the dress shows off an appropriate amount of leg./"
"work","Fit great, I was afraid it might be boxy, but very cute!"
"work","One of the favorites I have rented!","Its made out of very thick material but not uncomfortably heavy.","I loved the Trapeze cut because although its forgiving, its also structured enough not to be a mumu (nothing wrong with mumus).","I also like the flowery details because it adds a little pizzaz!","Highly recommend this dress, looks expensive as well.","It runs true to size.","Im between 8-10 and the size 44 (UK size-US 10) was perfect since I dont like clothes that are restrictive or tight!"
"work","I love the material especially the cuffs really made the sweater stand out."
"work","Im obsessed with this cobalt blue color- looks great in person!","Im typically a size 4 and I felt it fit a bit bigger than Id like: Id recommend sizing down or pairing with a belt.","The lower back is open by the way...I like this versatile dress paired w/ a jacket or cardigan for work, and then you can remove it for after-work drinks or a date!","Easy fit, and wore normal undergarments.","Im petite (52) and it fell to a conservative knee length on me."
"work","Great dress but unflattering.","I wore 12 and person to right is wearing an 8.","Considering that I could have fit into a 10 if I had not worn a bra, dress shouldn’t be so loose.","I still had plenty of room after several beverages and eating at a buffet."
"work","I received this dress a bit late, so I didnt get the chance to take a photo in it, but it was perfect for my work event!","The material was nice and thick, perfect for October with a light jacket.","The bodice is not very forgiving, especially right below the bust.","The 0 fit well, but wouldnt move around my ribs.","It would have been fine for a shorter event, but knowing Id be wearing it for 10+ hours, I decided to wear the 2, which fit well except the skirt, which was slightly too wide on me, but still looked great!","The colors are even better in person - theres some blue in the dress thats hard to see in the photo.","Great dress!"
"work","Great top for work or play!"
"work","Perfect fit - color was exactly how shown.","I am 53 and the length was perfect for me to wear to work - not too short or too long!"
"work","This dress was so fun to wear to work, and went straight from that to happy hour with friends.","The fit was true to size, but the belted waist doesnt  give so was more comfortable before eating.","I liked the print and contrasting pattern assembly-- that detail, the interesting waist and split front with ruffle made it a striking dress workable for many different occasions.","It can easily be paired with a jacket or sweater for cooler temperatures.","Definitely a winner, and Id rent it again."
"work","super cute skirt for work - received compliments from coworkers would definitely rent again"
"work","Fit was great, modern shape and great fabric."
"work","This is a very body con dress.","It runs SNUG and I could definitely wear it for a night out but not for work as planned.","If you are really slip (particularly in then chest and hips), it might look more conservative on you.","But it was very vampy for a day at the office.","I opted to return it and might try a larger size for the office."
"work","Wonderful fit, not too short, and comfortable to wear to the office."
"work","I wore this to a work event with black shorts and thought it was very cute.","Its sort of a bit oversized, but not overwhelming, even on a small frame.","It was heavier than I expected, but not in a bad way.","Just substantial.","Its a bit of a boxy fit, but not cropped.","I really liked it!"
"work","Fit well.","I wore it with leggings which was pretty"
"work","lining sticks out a little in the front of the skirt"
"work","Wore it for work, great light material."
"work","Really fun and unique top but definitely runs small.","I have broad athletic shoulders and usually wear a size 10 in shirts due to them.","It was a feat to get into this 44 (US 12),  it ended up being too small to wear comfortably."
"work","Super cute and comfy.","I paired it with tights and boots to make it work appropriate since its a smidge shorter than I expected.","Would be a fun spring and summer dress!"
"work","Fit was fantastic"
"work","this was fancier than I wanted.","The shiny pleated skirt made me think wedding, so I didnt wear it."
"work","The dress is very cute, appropriate for work, adorable little black cutouts fabric at the bottom.","Slightly itchy,  but fine once I added nylons.","Work appropriate length for someone 510.","I would say it ever so slightly runs large.","Im a straight 6 in everything and it was totally wearable, but the bodice had the tiniest bit of extra fabric.","If you are truly in between sizes I would size down.","Because the dress is very sweet looking I would say its totally appropriate for it to be ever so slightly large on top."
"work","the dress pulls in the bust.","I tried sitting different ways and it still would open, even the the dress had plenty of room and wasnt too small.","Otherwise its a great dress!"
"work","Youll need a safety pin."
"work","This jacket was absolutely one of my favorite pieces - perfect length for work, two styles of pockets made this piece not only fun to wear but dynamic.","I wish there were more jacket sin other fabrics and colors cut just like this one."
"work","Very nice and professional looking dress.","The fabric is stretchy but you should still size up for your back up size.","This dress is great for any cup size.","A standard bra also works!","I would rent again."
"work","I am pear-shaped and while it fit well below the waist, it was far looser up top than in the models photo."
"work","The color of this dress is actually much more of a bright neon cobalt blue in person so if youre looking for a bold statement color, look no further.","I wanted to love this piece, but it was definitely made for a smaller cup size than 34C.","The neckline has a hook closure and it would buckle the fabric when clasped.","Also the length wasnt flattering on my 53 frame.","This would look stunning on someone who is closer in shape and size to the figure in the RTR pictures of this dress."
"work","I wore this on a work trip with black pumps and red lipstick.","I was in a warm climate so it was perfect for warm workday and client dinner afterwards.","My dress arrived with tags still on so I was first to wear.","Loved it."
"work","I wore this dress to a work event with a business dress code.","I added a white blazer during the meeting (as the room was cold).","I found this dress ran true to size (to maybe a tiny bit small).","I wore the 4, but would have preferred the 6 (53, 125lbs, 34D) if it had been available.","I found that since the dress was a tiny bit too small the zipper in the back did not lay flat.","This dress was very flattering, incredible comfortable (wore for 11 hours) and would work in a variety of situations (work event, wedding, shower, etc).","The lace overlay helps to hide any figure flaws and I found the shave of the pattern creates the illusion of an hourglass figure.","Would definitely recommend!"
"work","Which I do not.","The fabric is great - good drape and good structure.","The print is deceptively complex.","The fit is flattering.","Unless you have broad shoulders that dont look great in a raglan sleeve."
"work","I put a black tank underneath in hopes of making it more professional but it was still too dressy and sexy for the workplace.","Would be an awesome dress for a cocktail party or wedding!","Runs small like all the Le Petite Robe styles do."
"work","Color is amazing.","This runs small though.","Glad I read this in another reviewer.","Size up one size.","Great forgiving fabric.","Slit ruffle makes this typical cut unique."
"work","This Marni dress is true to size/ slightly large.","The fabric feels almost like a light cotton canvas.","It is a bit boxy but in a chic way.","I love that it is very stylish and not typical (aka very Marni) and is completely appropriate for work and dinners out.","My husband, who usually does not remark on such things, said that he thought the dress looked really nice and fit well.","I love this dress!"
"work","the material is on the thicker side, but still fine for warmer weather.","the blue is really nice.","very deep and rich.","however, the sizing was crazy.","Im between a 10 and 12, and i got the large.","I probably could have gotten the medium (which is unheard of ) and it would have been fine."
"work","Fit well and comfortable.","Arrived pressed and ready to wear.","It was a good experience and received many compliments."
"work","Terrific dress, but ordered it for work and the neckline was too low cut for the office.","Would be great for a dinner date though!"
"work","I really liked this top the pretty red really makes it unique.","I received several compliments on it.","I dont tuck shirts in and I know the model wearing the shirt had it tucked in for the picture but I thought it looked great untucked too.","There is no way I could have pulled the shirt up onto my shoulders it is definitely an off the shoulder top.","Loved it!"
"work","Very flattering for all sizes.","It stretches and is very forgiving and slimming.","I didnt want to give it back!"
"work","The pattern on this dress was beautiful and I couldnt wait to try it on but the fit was just off.","It was baggy and loose up top and too tight in the hips.","It also had a very low waist (almost a drop waist) that I didnt find flattering."
"work","Perfect for work...Lots of compliments...Unique, modern style.","Would love to own it..."
"work","I am in love with this dress.","I would keep it and wear it again, but its such a memorable dress that Ill send it back and rent it again in a month or so when enough time has passed.","I rented a 10 instead of an 8 since I was going to have a large dinner meeting with clients and wanted to leave room for my food baby - it was perfect.","I got lots of compliments and it was super cute.","My only watch out is that the neck of the dress includes a little plunge in the center with a lace up bit, if youre worried about work appropriateness, just tie that really tight to make sure youre not showing off a lot of bra or cleavage."
"work","Long loose body, pattern and ties at the arms make it unique!"
"work","A fun pattern for the classic DVF wrap dress!","This wrap dress would be perfect for the spring and summer months.","The dress fit true to size as I usually wear a size 4 in dresses.","I would recommend sizing up as the backup size or for women who are curvier.","This style is stretchy however, it is fitted throughout.","At 56 it hit right at the knee.","This classic silhouette works perfectly on everyone!"
"work","The only con is the sleeves can get in the way of working and eating.","Be careful with them."
"work","Dress was a beautiful color and cut was slimming.","I received a lot of compliments on the interesting hem."
"work","I wore this for an important day of meetings, followed by dinner with a friend.","It was great - free-flowing and forgiving for nearly any body type, without being too boxy.","A little tight at the neck, but not too restricting."
"work","Beautiful dress, but the built in slip hung well below the hem so I couldnt wear it :("
"work","perfect length"
"work","great colors"
"work","Im 54 and it was pretty long and loose.","Usually wear a 0 but it felt like one or two sizes too big"
"work","I wore this alot and it was perfect for work to have as a just in case you need a jacket backup."
"work","I wore this dress to work and I absolutely loved it!","Its made of thick material so I felt really comfortable in it.","The top (bust) was tight and I am a small chested woman.","The rest of the dress fit perfectly."
"work","Very feminine, very sweet.","I got a lot of compliments."
"work","Cute, easy pick for work or any event - nice length for those who are taller!"
"work","Loved the black and olive combination on this dress and the shape all the detailing gave me.","I went up a size after reading some reviews that this could be tight through the bust, and the S was a perfect fit.","Very comfortable for work and will definitely be renting again!"
"work","Love this DVF dress, I have slowly made my way through every color that this wrap dress comes in.","If you have a small bust like me, you may need a safety pin for the front, but it was easy to hide.","So flattering"
"work","x"
"work","Im 57, so not too tall.","This dress probably wouldve been great for a date night, but not for a work event."
"work","I usually rent between a 6 and an 8 but went for the 10 after reading all the other reviews re: running small / tight arms and shoulders / etc.","The 10 was great for my upper body but left some major gaps in the waist... leaving me with a shape similar to a refrigerator.","Loved the pattern and fabric, though!"
"work","Oddly enough, I wore this both to work and to a wedding.","The difference was all in the heels and the accessories!","Rich, vibrant color.","Unique and classy cut with the pockets.","Very nice dress."
"work","This dress is easy to wear, fitting fairly loose.","It is a bit on the shorter side, Im 56 and it hit about 6 above the knee, but with tights it was demure enough for work.","I enjoyed wearing it, felt put together without much effort."
"work","I liked this dress a lot, in part because it was quite a bit different then what I would normally chose.","The hem was fun and swirly - a little bit longer on someone like me, whos only 52, but I didnt think the dress made me look too short (i.e.","on me it hit below the knees in the front, whereas I think its supposed to be knee length).","The waist is very tight, as many have pointed out, with no give so Id size up for a backup if you get one.","Its a very flattering dress, that really emphasizes your natural waistline.","As others remarked, mine had hanger dents in the shoulder of the sweater part.","It didnt keep me from wearing it, but when I got it I did just drape it over the hanger bar vs keeping it hung up normal (and further denting it).","Also - I didnt love the sweater material, felt a little acrylic and cheap (Ironic, given its a designer dress).","But not enough to not recommend it or anything!"
"work","Rented this for everyday wear/work.","Paired it with dark skinny jeans and it was a simple classic look.","The fit is loose and flowy, so it looked better with a half tuck to achieve some shape.","I did like the unique sleeve detail with the tab to give it a slight lift near the wrist, instead of like most shirts with a tab where you have to roll up the sleeve to elbow length to button it up."
"work","Absolutely stunning and easy to wear."
"work","Really nice cut and fabric, but it was much smaller than expected.","Couldnt wear it!"
"work","I rented this for work/weekend and was a little underwhelmed.","Its a cute piece, but both the sweater and the sleeves were a little itchy.","It was a bit short in the torso (and Im a short person, so thats saying a lot).","It was also tight around the waist so it was a bit unflattering on my stomach.","I give it four stars because it looks just like the picture, but I wouldnt rent again."
"work","Channel your inner Twiggy but keep it classy like Audrey Hepburn in this super cute frock of duo-colored daisies with red orange and white on a very deep, rich navy blue like the night sky.","I wore this to work today and it fits just slightly larger than I would like.","However, I am totally okay with a slightly larger fit than not being able to breathe in this dress.","Here in the South, we have hot and humid weather.","I, for one, sweat like Ive been sitting in a sauna if I wear a dress with the heaviest material possible.","However, here I am in roughly 80+ degrees and feeling comfortable.","How could this be?!","Its still a mystery to me.","I wore this dress with simple camel colored flats since I just moved to my new home and couldnt find my nude wedges I had bought for summertime work attire.","Highly recommend this fun dress if you want something different from your slacks and blouses."
"work","I am 58 and the arms on this dress were WAY too short.","It was a beautiful fabric and fit but with the puffed shoulders, the shorter sleeves just didnt look right on me.","I was bummed I couldnt wear it since it was super cute!"
"work","The dress was really cute and I got several compliments at the office.","It was true to size around the waist, but it gaped at the chest (Im a C/D), so I had to safety pin it together."
"work","This dress was perfect to throw on for work.","Its light weight, not see through and it fits conservatively (does not hug you).","The only area its a bit snug in is the arms.","Wrinkles semi-quickly but would definitely rent again!"
"work","It is especially flattering on curvier ladies."
"work","Ive worn this a couple times.","I wore it shopping and to work.","Such a soft silky rich feel.","The colors are pretty.","Love this top!"
"work","The dress runs a little wide in the hips, so I couldve worn a size down in this.","Nice stretchy material and it didnt wrinkle easily."
"work","I am normally a 6 but it was kind of baggy.","Still looked great but a 4 would have been a better curve hugging fit."
"work","Paired it with a white collared button down and green heels (on St. Pattys).","Loved the look and the fabric... but between the undershirt and the Irish-fare for lunch, it felt a smidge tight (especially through the chest and shoulders) and I probably would have been a bit more comfortable in the 8."
"work","I loved this top and probably should have held on to it for longer.","I wore it with a black pencil skirt but think it would have looked better with pants or jeans.","The only con about this top is that it is hard to move your arms.","I had to wait for a day at work where I knew I wouldnt be moving around too much."
"work","Great color - more neon than coral."
"work","The neckline runs low unless you really wrap it around you tightly, so keep that in mind if you want to wear it to work like me!","I got many compliments!"
"work","My favorite part of this dress is the fuchsia color and the cute cut of the sleeves.","Overall it fit true to size for me and I have a very hourglass figure.","Only problem was that it was a bit short for my comfort especially when sitting but it was perfect with tights for work and happy hour with friends."
"work","I usually wear a 2 or 4.","I went with the 38 but it was quite tight across the shoulders.","I would recommend sizing up if you have broad shoulders.","Otherwise the dress is great, a good length for work."
"work","I loved wearing this jumpsuit!","It required a little time time to get in and out during bathroom runs, but overall, it was really comfortable and flattering.","I found a way to wrap and tie the sash in the back that I liked."
"work","I rented this for a large press conference event I worked on for my job.","I loved it because it was professional, but still really stylish and I got a lot of compliments on it throughout the day.","A beautiful color and very well made.","Would rent again."
"work"," nice colors"
"work","fits loosely, but flattering"
"work","This piece is truly spectacular.","The level of detail is astounding.","I have a very hourglass figure and this dress accentuated it to a T. I actually had multiple people ask me if it was custom made for me.","Wish I could afford to keep this one!"
"work","This was my first jumpsuit to try.","It fit great and looked good.","Lots of people commented on how it fit and looked.","The fabric was high quality and laid nice all day.","The pants were only slightly cropped on me as I am short.","I had to pin the top to stay and not show too much, but the fabric is heavy enough that the pinning was not visible and stayed put all day.","I would love to rent this again."
"work","Loved this dress though it was bit worn looking.","The pattern is beautiful and the material is thick in a good way.","Highly recommend!","Size down."
"work","I got these to wear to work and they were ADORABLE.","I probably got 20 compliments on them throughout the day and all the women in my office wanted to know where I got them.","Bonus points for being so comfy.","Definitely will be renting them again!"
"work","Rans shorter than normal."
"work","The dress wasnt small in my case but I put in runs small because it fit quite nicely on me and Im supposed to be an xs.","It is a really cute dress!","Got many compliments.","The only thing I was worried about was the draping of the dress.","The fabric hangs off the body so my belly, which I dont have much of,  was visible in my opinion, but Im fairly sure that could be in my head and most people wouldnt notice.","All in all a great summer/work dress!"
"work","Dress was fine, but definitely runs small and short.","Im usually a 4-6 and the 8 still looked tight on me.","The material photographs better than it looks close up.","Didnt love, didnt hate."
"work","This coat looks great on everyone.","It fit me super well.","The sleeves were the perfect 3/4 length.","A number of women at work also wanted to try it on.","It also fit someone 5 inches shorter than me super well... AND it fit one of our pregnant coworkers really well too.","Truly versatile coat.","Super well made."
"work","very comfortable, easy to wear pattern, the slit on the side adds a little something, fit very well for someone btwn a 2 and 4. hem hit a touch above the knee, wore a reg bra.","this is a staple dress you can wear again and again.","it isnt the most exciting, but is very useful.","i liked the small touches.","would def  recommend for a work day"
"work","Super cute dress.","The front is a tad revealing/low, but still very cute."
"work","Listen to the reviews!","While the outer shell of the dress is gorgeous and drapes in a looser, more flattering manner, the inner sheath is disproportionately straight and restrictive.","If you have curvy hips or thighs, the inner lining WILL bunch up on you and disrupt the overall drape of the dress.","I was able to get away with it, but it required constantly readjustment.","That said, I received several compliments from my bf, coworkers, and strangers.","The navy and hot pink contrast work well."
"work","I would say the only down side to this dress was that the zipper on the side would slightly pinch on the side, so that I often had to pull it down to make it even.","Otherwise, the dress is beautiful.","The slits along the skirt move so nicely when you walk.","I highly recommend this sophisticated look."
"work","Fit very well."
"work","Great cut and fabric"
"work","This dress is bright.","It is a bright orange.","Not for the shy.","It is form fitted and the pockets are right are the hip.","You have to be comfortable with accentuating your hips and yourself.","I love this dress & have rented it twice."
"work","Great structureLoved it"
"work","This dress may have just been worn too many times at this point.","The neck is so stretched out that the inside lining is constantly coming out, and Im fixing it all day.","Its also incredibly low cut and saggy (again probably from being stretched out) on me, and Im between a C and D cup.","I gave it 4 stars because I think it would be cute if you got a newer dress."
"work","Big for a petite person like me."
"work","I love the pleats and movement with this dress.","I was worried that it would not fit right, since I have a shorter torso, but the waist band hid any extra gathers.","Such a pretty pattern, would rent again."
"work","Tight in all the right places and received many compliments everywhere I went!"
"work","Fantastic dress.","Lovely, classic navy that you can add color to with jewelry, accessories and shoes.","The flounce bottom gives it just a little extra something.","Loved it!"
"work","These pants are great, thick fabric with just enough stretch to keep them comfortable.","After reading other reviews I stuck with my normal size 2 and they fit well in the waist but I felt they were a bit tight in the thighs.","I love the waist band details with the two buttons and they make my butt look amazing!","Im pretty tempted to buy these despite the hefty price tag, theyre that good!"
"work","The fabric was so soft and the dress was overall super comfortable and stylish.","I got so many compliments at the office."
"work","The dress was a loose fit and a great color.","I styled it in several different ways.","With tights, booties and a vest.","Belted with pumps.","Oversized cardigan and tall boots.","Loved wearing this."
"work","Recommend high waist shaper nylons vs. pieces."
"work","Wore with black boots and patterned black tights and a suit jacket.","Fit perfectly.","I would have normally worn a small but this dress runs small."
"work","Great color.","Great fit, you can never go wrong with a wrap dress!","Gorgeous material,"
"work","Such a comfortable dress!","It fits true to size and it fitted at the natural waist.","For a back up size, I would size up just to be safe.","The fabric is very stretchy.","You will need a strapless bra because the top sections is see through.","Such a fun and comfy dress!!",":)"
"work","I LOVE these pants so much!","If you ever need to go to work but have a fun night out planned after, wear these with some strappy heels and you have the perfect day to night transition!","The material is so amazing and comfortable; I would never feel like the waistband is tight in the wrong places.","The high waist is perfect so you can definitely tuck in a tank top or even a blouse to pair with these pants.","The flared bottom works amazing for every body type and definitely makes a statement!","I cant wait to try these in an SR next!"
"work","I loved the idea of this dress, but it just wasnt made for us pear shaped gals.","The top was way too loose, and the lapels didnt lay correctly on me.","The waist was also too large.","The hip area was not tight, but didnt really lay correctly.","The pockets also laid strangely.","This dress needs a lining.","Also a vast improvement would be if the belt was not attached in the back!","Since it was attached, I couldnt make the belt tighter and simultaneously line up the buckle with the trench style opening.","I still wore it and it looked fine, but definitely not a special occasion dress."
"work","This is a cute top but is very flowy and runs large, even the XS.","The sides are also open so if you wanted to wear this to work you would need to wear a tank top underneath.","The color and concept is great, just wish the fit was better."
"work","Beautiful dress.","It is very form fitting all the way down to the hem.","The fabric is so high quality it works with girls with curves like me."
"work","this had the weirdest fit around the shoulders.","i actually have pretty defined shoulders from working out, but it was still large an sloppy looking.","i have a small bust (34A) and it fit fine there, just large in the shoulders.","i would actually buy this dress i liked it so much otherwise, but i would have to tailor it for sure."
"work","This jacket is awesome!","Super structured and silky with a beautiful floral print.","I paired it with a slimming black turtleneck and black high-waisted skinny jeans for a job interview - and killed it.","Highly recommend !"
"work","Got so much compliments!","I thought it would look like a potato sack on me but thank goodness I have curves even though I am very short :)"
"work","Looser fit than expected.","Very pretty fabric.","Perfect for the office"
"work","Fits true to size.","Im 34DDD so i needed to wear a L making the rest large a flowy but it worked nicely with the cut of the shirt."
"work","Cute dress.","Wore to the office on a casual Friday.","I wore in a 12 but could have gotten away with a 10.","Will rent again!"
"work","I wore this dress twice, once with flats and another time with heels.","The fabric is breathable but feels appropriate.","Overall, this look was versatile, great for after-work drinks, and super comfy."
"work","I originally got the S but exchanged it bc it was a little tight in the mid section.","The M worked great for work."
"work","This was a different silhouette than the fitted sheath type I usually go for, so it took a little getting used to, but that lasted about 10 minutes.","Three compliments later, I couldnt help but feel special and ladylike in this dress.","I wore it with a slip as a precaution for static cling, which someone else had mentioned in a review, and I had no problem whatsoever.","I did not try it without the slip so I cannot comment on that.","An inch longer would have made it ideal, but Im tall, so that wont affect everyone.","I would recommend pairing with sheer black hosiery as opposed to tights, since opaque tights would be a bit heavy looking for this filmy fabric.","Just my opinion."
"work","Beautiful jacket - I wore with a white thin blouse underneath.","The jacket is VERY thin and not lined at all, so its great for warmer weather especially."
"work","I love the color of this blazer!","It really adds a unique twist to the sea of black and navy in a typical office.","I also love how the zippers add a modern edge to an already classic look.","I typically wear a size four, but work a size 2 in this jacket.","I would have preferred my true size, but the two was not too tight.","I recommend sizing up if you plan on wearing this closed and sized down if you prefer to keep the blazer opened!","I wore this with the Theory Flash Maxi but would love to try out this blazer with dark skinny jeans and boots at night!"
"work","Its really cute but I found it to be tight through the upper arms and shoulders.","I ended up returning it before wearing it because I didnt think I would have a full range of motion during the day.","Its also pretty low cut.","You probably need a camisole underneath."
"work","I loved this dress when I first saw it and put it on but it is too big for me.","You can tell the waist should be fitted but I had to belt this one.","The bust is also kind of roomy which is not my usual problem.","It was mid-knee length on me.","It was still a cute dress when I wore it but I wouldnt rent this again."
"work","This is one of the Unlimited dresses that has been in my rotation this fall & winter.","Each time I ordered it, I kept it for about a month.","Its gone from work to showers to parties.","Perfect fit & flare dress in a versatile color palate."
"work","I generally wear a 4 and ordered a size 6 due to other reviews that said it ran big.","I think I could have gotten away with the 4 since the 6 fit a bit loose which was fine, but I think it may have looked a little better if it was more fitted.","Overall the fabric is lovely - nice and cool and I was very comfortable wearing it all day on a warm fall day."
"work","The fit was a little disappointing, it fit too tight in the hip area.","If you have hips, order one size up.","I will probably order this again in the next size.","I was constantly pulling it down.","Otherwise it is a beautiful color and love the hemline.","I wore it with black tights and boots, really cute!"
"work","Body con - but just enough room to breathe"
"work","Sleeves are a little short but otherwise dress is great."
"work","Renting this for work is because Im fundraising talent for PBS.","So I have particular requirements: dress needs to be modest enough that it can be on PBS, I need a place to hide a microphone, and it needs to be a solid color.","This dress was all of the above, and I would also wear this for a real life event!","I sized up a little to give myself extra room for the microphone pack, and it was really comfortable.","Some girlfriends also said that it gave my girls a little more oomph than in day to day life, which is not a bad thing!"
"work","For some reason I thought this brand ran small on me butI wish I would have selected a 6.","The 8was a bit lose all  over and definitely through lower half even more but I really liked the dress for work and wore it anyway.","Next time will just order a 6.","Length was fine for the office as well."
"work","I liked this dress but felt it kept getting shorter and shorter as the day went on due to the stretch material."
"work","I rented this dress as business attire for an event, and it fit the bid!","Comfortable, easy to move in, and it looks great!"
"work","Beautiful dress, very flattering.","Runs a bit large since the material is stretchy.","I would love to own this dress but dont know how often I will need to wear this."
"work","The dress is very comfortable - aside from the knot in the back.","To keep the dress fitted, you must tie a knot in the back.","The only difficult part about this is that the knot presses into your back while sitting.","The material is a bit thicker but is great for moving around in.","The color is also a rich Navy blue.","The sleeves also help make your arms look thinner."
"work","i love this jumpsuit.","im typically a 4, but usually a 2 in trina turk, opted for the 4 this time and it fit well!","plenty of room, but the belt cinched the waist so it didnt matter that there are room all around.","im short so even with 4 inch pointy pumps (that thats what this shld be worn with!","), it still touched the floor.","i would warn anyone shorter away from this.","i just made it.","the pockets, color, opening in the back, EVERYTHING was perfect.","the only only con, was the bathroom.","the belt and zipper makes it a little more work and there is a lot of fabric to wrangle, but worth it.","RENT THIS!","!"
"work","This dress has a classy print and fit very well.","Definitely true to size.","It doesnt have a slit on the back of the skirt and the fabric doesnt stretch much so wider hip ladies may need to go a size up to get the dress on.","My hips are much wider than my waist and I had to wiggle a little to get into this dress!","But one it was on, it looked great.","Also, for short ladies with a short torso, the V neck will be a bit low and you will show cleavage (you cant tell at all from the pic on the site).","I wore it to an after work function and got many compliments.","I wouldnt have worn it all day to work due to the cleavage situation but taller people wont have this issue."
"work","I received so my compliments.","It looks rich and feels good.","The material is heavy but not hot or weighted.","I wore it to work but had to keep worrying about my girls showing a bit, but you can arrange the top so that they dont show.","Overall its a very nice dress for work, weddings, parties or other events."
"work","pre-baby i was a size 6 and a size 10 in this five months post partum worked out nicely."
"work","These fit great, but the fabric showed every.","single.","dimple.","I clearly havent been hitting the gym enough lately and these really accentuated it.","I wanted to love them, but just not for me."
"work","I rented this dress for a conference for work and not only was it comfortable, I received a number of compliments.","I ended up wearing the smaller of the two sizes I rented.","My only complaints would be that the material is much thicker than I expected and that the fabric seemed to retain the smell from the drycleaning.","Loved that it had pockets."
"work","Such a chic dress.","I rented it for work, but it would look great for a holiday party as well."
"work","I returned this without wearing it.","I hated the fabric as soon as I took it out of the package."
"work"," its so fun, yet professional.","Looks great and grabs attention"
"work","The fit and color of this dress are great!","Its a little short, but not inappropriate.","I put a blazer on for work and took it off to go out.","Paired with nude heels for  a work appropriate look."
"work","I received the Alice dress as a backup option when my original dress was not available in the size that I ordered.","I ended up not needing it because the smaller size in my first dress worked fine.","However, the Alice dress is adorable, and I would definitely wear it for another occasion.","As others have noted the arms are a bit snug, but they are not so snug that I would avoid the dress altogether.","I like the length and shape of the dress.","I find it flattering and comfortable.","Thank you to RTR for quickly sending another dress so that I had options!"
"work","fit was great"
"work","There are no real surprises here.","its a Diane Von Furstenberg.","If you dont wear DVF regularly, you should know that they run smaller than normal.","It seems like they kept the sizing from the early 80s when the DVF wrap became a classic.","The only thing I would quibble about with the dress I wore is that the print was cut so that an unusually large patch of white ran across the top of my left breast and in the pictures from my speech, it looks like my bra is hanging out.","I know that it wasnt, because my bra was beige.","Its a great work dress overall."
"work","I received a ton of compliments on this dress.","It fit me well and was comfortable.","If you have wider hips or a large bust, err on the larger size."
"work","lovely fit... but shoulder padding needs some love"
"work","The skirt is true to size.","I could have worn a 4 but the 6 was only available to select for u limited!","The colors are bright and beautiful!","And the built in slip was perfect!","Received many compliments when I wore this for a business trip.","Definitely will be renting this again and ultimately trying to score this as a purchase!"
"work","I wore this for a work meeting with new Clients.","This jacket is flattering and professional without being bland."
"work","This is an absolute beauty of a top, the detail is beyond words but it is too short.","I did not have a high waisted pant at the time to pull it off and didnt feel like being worried about lifting my arms all day so I sent it back.","Sadly!","!"
"work","I LOVE this dress.","However, the belt was missing, so I had to scrounge to find one of my own, but I made it work.","The fabric is a thick denim-ish material.","I wore the size 40/US 4 and I typically wear a size 6 dress.","I thought this one fit me perfectly, with the exception of being slightly large on top (not unusual for me).","The armholes are cut pretty wide and the material IS really think--I wouldnt wear this without a top underneath--I think it would look strange sleeveless on me--my bra and too much armpit and surrounding area would show.","Plus, this dress seems more appropriate for fall and winter.","I wore this to lunch with a client and I also wore it to a play.","I plan to wear it again when I meet with clients.","Sorry, ladies--Im keeping this one for a while!","!"
"work","Perfect summer dress and you could wear this out for cocktails after work."
"work","Absolutely no cons with this dress.","I definitely recommend renting it...in fact, I may possibly buy it because it is very versatile and can be worn almost anywhere."
"work","I wore this to work one day and got at least 5 compliments.","Its not a flashy dress, but the cut and collar when paired with a fun necklace (I added heels and a big bag!)","is right on trend.","It is a thick material.","Chic piece, would definitely recommend trying!"
"work","This is a very flattering dress, beautiful color."
"work","This was a beautiful print and I received lots of compliments on it.","However, it does wrinkle pretty easily.","It also has a very boxy fit which is not the most figure flattering for a thinner person without a lot of curves."
"work","Fit like a dream.","Loved this top because its so well made and incredibly flattering.","I think I love Suno in general but this is kind of a wardrobe staple with a bit of fun with the front ruffle thingie.","Def a re-rent.",":)"
"work","the black part is a nice, stretchy material and very comfortable.","Almost like a thicker spandex."
"work","This was perfect!","Just the right amount of fluff, and a perfect length for me!"
"work","I liked (not loved) this look.","Length was perfect for work.","Fabric was a cottony type denim, which I wasnt expecting.","This made it a bit sportier than Id typically wear for work....but still got away with it.","I liked the fun a-line and how the hem spread out on the sides and dipped high in the center.","Fabric was comfy and forgiving.","But waist is tight, so Spanx might be needed.","Overall cute, and could work for daytime...but I MIGHT use for happy hour but not for any functions where you want to look dolled up or sophisticated.","Fun and functional."
"work","Pros: Gorgeous, vibrant color, great material, fun sleeves, good length.","Cons: Its a little tight, especially in the chest area and Im not large chested.","I am still rating it as true to size since Im between a 2 and 4, but ordered the 2 based on other reviews."
"work","Nice fit and not too long as it may look in the photo"
"work","Crisp white shift, easy to dress up or down!","Although this dress runs slightly large, it is still meant to have an oversized look to it.","I think if I rent again I will try the size XS, but I still liked how the small looked.","With room in the bust, waist, and hips this style will fit various body types.","At 57 the length hit at about mid thigh.","The shift bodice falls nicely and is super comfortable for work or walking around town.","Definitely recommend nude undergarments.","Looks great with sandals or heeled boots!"
"work","Very professional look, extremely true to size"
"work","Fits well.","Great, thick material.","Professional.","Zipper is actually black, not Gold as shown in photo.","(refer to my photo for true zipper color).","Received compliments.","Not my most favorite rent, but worked well."
"work","I had to wear a Nikibiki in black under this dress as it was very low cut for work.","I wore with black tights and boots and got lots of compliments of people loving the DVF wrap.","Didnt realize the dress was sweater material.","Didnt stretch and was a little tight in the arms."
"work","The fit was off on my body type.","Wish it would have worked - such a cute dress otherwise"
"work","Wrinkled a little while sitting."
"work","This dress was triple threat.","I had my eye on this dress and decided to rent it for work.","Glad I did!","I did have a little difficulty with getting it over my head, but otherwise the dress was a great fit.","Received tons of compliments on how fun the dress was."
"work","Need to size up slightly so that the fabric folds across the chest sit correctly on my curvy shorter body."
"work","Great look, very flattering...bunched up a little in the back when I walked but otherwise it is an excellent dress.","Will rent again."
"work","I wore this to work and received many compliments.","Loved the color and cut.","The material was flimsy and seemed a bit cheap, but it was definitely wearable."
"work","The fabric is really thick and nice!","No wrinkling.","The dress was a little roomy in the waste, so it was very comfortable."
"work","Wore this for the first day on a new job.","The dress is very business professional and the ruffle in front adds a little bit of spice!","Perfect choice!"
"work","Beautifully made.","Lined inside so was nice and warm.","Sophisticated look."
"work","I liked the color, which was a slightly deeper orange than I expected from the photo, and the material is quite heavy, making it a nice winter dress.","However, I was surprised by how the 6 hung off me as Im a very consistent size 6 in dresses - had to send it back without wearing."
"work","Perfect fit with a bit of stretch in the fabric.","Bright color to liven the office up!"
"work","This is an elegant yet simple dress.","I wore it all day and it did not wrinkle."
"work","Just like everyone said, the dress was HUGE and BEAUTIFUL.","I normally wear a 44 or 46...got this in a 38 and it still swallowed me.","I still wore it because of the beautiful pleating and amazing details."
"work","I gave this dress 5 stars even though I did not wear it.","Although it fit perfectly, its a bit too cool for me.","I felt as if I had four arms!","Its a beautiful dress, just takes a cool lady to wear it!"
"work","This dress definitely runs small and Im glad I ordered a 4 based on others reviews.","In the end, I loved it so much I ended up buying it in black directly from the designer!","Its fitted but a modest look because the fabric is sturdy enough to help shape you without hugging you too tight.","Its easy to dress up and down and Im excited to a have a staple black work dress in my closet now"
"work","This is my favorite dress Ive rented from unlimited.","I usually wear a size 4, but ordered a 2.","I would order a 0 in the future.","Its gorgeous & comfortable, not itchy at all.","Definitely would consider buying this one!"
"work","Wore this to work with a pencil skirt.","Cute summer basic."
