"date","I rented this for a first date with my now boyfriend.","We matched!","His shirt was the same color blue as this dress and we both wore white sneakers.","I was smitten pretty quickly, both with him and this dress.","This dress was brand new when it got to me, tag still on.","The pockets are great and the fabric quality is phenomenal.","Thick and structured, but soft and not heavy.","I rented an 8 to be careful because this was part of unlimited and only got one size, but I could have worn a 6 without a problem.","Im only sad that I dont own this.","If things with my boyfriend keep going well, I might buy this for the sentimental value."
"date","I was not a big fan of this dress and didnt end up wearing it.","It has a lot of pretty detail but runs short and tight.","Another issue I had was the lining, which is a grey heathered sweatshirt material.","It added a thickness to the dress.","My husband said it looked like a sorority party dress which wasnt what I was going for but it could be a cute dress for the right person/ occasion."
"date","I wore size 2.","I wore a strapless bra underneath.","The material is medium thickness.","Theres no lining but I didnt have any issues with underwear lines.","I wore this for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend.","He thought it was very sexy.","I really liked how it was below the knee length but then the silt made it extra sexy and it was functional to walk in.","My boyfriend hates it when my attire slows me down as hes already 14 inches above me.","Warning: if you wear this walking down the street you will get stared at.","If my tall, large, alpha male, boyfriend wasnt present Im sure I would have gotten unwanted catcalls.","That said I would wear it again for date night."
"date","I loved this dress!","I was a little surprised I fit in the 8 (I got a 10 as my back up); as I have previously worn Badgley Mischka dresses in 10s.","But there is plenty of room in the bust, and I think thats why I didnt have to go up a size.","Im a 36DD and didnt feel restricted by this dress.","Also loved that I could wear a normal bra with it.","I loved the low neckline, but it was too low for the bra I was wearing so I had to safety pin it shut a bit.","Im 6 feet tall, the dress hit about mid thigh and didnt feel uncomfortably short.","Fabric is heavy, but that was kind of nice on a chilly fall evening in LA.","The sequins didnt bother me at all.","I was told I looked beautiful yet comfortable - perfect way to sum up this dress!"
"date","The dress is super cute.","However, my hips are a little wider than your average person, so I felt like it made me look bigger on the bottom.","The dress does run a little big (in my opinion) so I was able to go down to a size 6 vs the size 8 that I had ordered."
"date","This would be cute on the right body type.","I have really big boobs and I felt like they would probably pop out if I started dancing or make any sudden movements.","The length worked well with 4 inch heels.","Needless to say I didnt end up wearing it.","I think it would work great for someone with small to maybe a large C cup boobs and very petite."
"date","This dress is gorgeous.","The color is more of a bright coral (vs. red as described).","The dress came new with tags on.","The cut of this dress is great for pear-shaped women and the fabric design was incredibly figure flattering.","The only challenge that I had was that the neckline kept coming down and revealing the top of my strapless bra.","The fabric is heavy so I felt like I was constantly tugging it back in to place.","Other than that, it was fantastic."
"date","I loved this dress!","The sleeves were fit but not too snug which is a big concern for most of the dresses on this site.","The lower part is stretchy but snug so I didnt need to wear my spanx.","You will need a strapless bra for sure.","I got so many compliments all night.","It really hugs your waist making an hourglass figure out of any body type.","Also the back is killer.","My fiance says he wishes I would have bought it!"
"date","I loved the color and the fabric on this dress.","I got it in a 44 and probably would have liked it a tad better in the 42, but even a little large this dress looked great on.","I wore it for a date night with my husband and it was definitely an eye-catcher.","I didnt receive any compliments (other than plenty from my husband!)","but overall I felt very sexy and confident.","It is a little too long for my height, even with 6 inch heels, as it went slightly below my knees.","Anyone shorter than 51 (even if wearing heels) should be warned that this will be a calf-length dress."
"date","Rented this for dinner with Friends for my 50th Birthday and felt fabulous.","The length through the torso and skirt were perfect; which is often difficult with Rent the Runway gowns.","Was a fun dress to wear for a summer night out and I received many compliments."
"date","Dress was a little short for my taste.","Went with the 6 so I could be more comfortable in the dress.","Also, if you want no panty lines...no panties.","I wore a regular bra with the dress.","Definitely comfortable and no risk of slipping out of the dress."
"date","I rented this for my 30th birthday where my husband surprised me with a trip to Chicago to see Hamilton.","I was antsy about the low back as Im not the thinnest in the world but felt comfortable, sexy, and confident in this all night.","I went braless which I wouldnt normally do but the front was tight enough to hold me in.","The lace hit right at my knee and the dress itself is pretty short but kept me covered.",";) The lacy was soft, not itchy.","Only thing to caution is to just be careful with the hook and eye closures that they dont snag on any of the lace."
"date","This dress fits very comfortably with elastic around the waist.","I love the open back.","Its very simple however and isnt something Id normally spend money to rent, but was my free birthday dress.","I was just going out to dinner so it was perfect for that.","The front is very simple, plain full coverage."
"date","Unfortunately, my preferred size (8) was not able to ship.","The size 10 was a bit big, which meant I had to keep hoiking it up, but it fit well enough.","The dress is very comfortable, especially given how sexy it is.","Nice thick fabric and lining.","It was perfect for my birthday dinner out and I received many compliments.","Definitely a stunner!"
"date","Wore it with high waisted shorts and nude heals.","For a petite frame like me, the shoulders were too wide and the arms were way too long.","Because of the material, I couldnt fold the sleeves up.","It is a mesh base so youll need a skin colored bra.","On a scale of ten, my boyfriend and I settled on a 6."
"date","I never wore this dress - but did snap a pic when I tried it on before I sent it back the next day.","Love the whole body of the dress, but the top chest area was super tight and the lace around the neckline was super flimsy and didnt look good.","Not sure if its a boob size issue (Im 34DD) or maybe I needed a larger size to get a better top fit?","I couldnt wear a bra and the dress had no boob perk support either.","So maybe better for a smaller chested girl."
"date","Very classy dress, great to play down with limited adornment or play up with fabulous accessories.","I am 36H 27 42 and usually wear a medium in Herve.","This was a bit tighter in the breast area, especially since the fabric was not quite as bandage as HL usually is (I liked the lighter material), but naturally busty girls will need a bra with this one."
"date","Such a fun, flirty little dress!!","Another one Id love to own and wear again and again.","The fabric has some give to it, so thats a big positive.","I didnt feel uncomfortable in it (even after a big steak dinner) :-) The white ruffle makes this dress super unique and unlike any dress Ive rented before."
"date","I appreciate the concept of this outfit because it provides a formal look with the jacket and it also states fun and casual with the shorts and sheer fabric.","I ordered both S & M and wanted to take the S top of the outfit and put it with the M bottoms.","The top is very loose in the bust area and reveals a lot of skin and can even expose a few lady parts if you dont arrange the top to fit your body.","The bottoms were a bit snug for me because I wore the S. If I wore the M, the top would have been out of control too large.","Overall, a good outfit."
"date","I was nervous about the fit at first.","I thought the 6 would be a better fit but it was loose.","The size 4 was perfect because the dress did not fall off my shoulders.","It was a little short, but not uncomfortably short."
"date","RTR had contacted me to let me know that the previous renter had not returned the belt, and had me choose a back-up.","After trying both, I loved how this made me feel so I just added my own belt.","I wanted to define my waist, but the belt isnt a requirement.","I wore shapewear underneath just to smooth everything out as the fabric does cling.","I was able to manage the zipper by myself.","I would rent this again."
"date","I was a little worried about this dress when i ordered it... all those sparkles, am i goining to look trashy?","Its so short and I am tall is it going to cover everything?","I took a chance and ordered it cause I thought it was cute inexpensive and it wasnt for an important event.","When I got it and tried it on it looked amazing on me and I felt like it drew just the right amount of attention being so sparkly.","It was pretty short but I am not afraid to show off some leg and you just have to mind yourself sitting down and bending over like any lady should if shes wearing any dress.","The fit was good it was a little big though I am kind of inbetween sizes 0 or 2 , so I always order both.","The 0 is usually a little tight and 2 is usually a little big but to my surprise the 0 fit well and was even a little loose in some places.","If you have a very small figure like myself you should keep in mind that it might be  little roomy in the hips and stomach but it wont look unflattering."
"date","Pretty dress, great color however it was so large I couldnt wear it, it was falling off of me.","I am 53 tall  and weigh 118 lbs with 32C bust and the size 2 was enormous.","Size down 1-2 sizes in this dress, trust me!"
"date","I wore this for a valentines dinner date in Chicago.","Since Ive got a shorter frame, I felt the sleeves were a little long and fussed with them throughout the night.","I loved the color and long sleeves, so I didnt have to keep myself bundled in my coat all evening at the restaurants open air  patio.","The dress was a little roomy and wasnt as fitted as the photos led me to believe."
"date","I wore this classy dress to dinner with my husband on Christmas Eve.","I wore a strapless bra with it - it has a lovely bateau neck.","It does have smidgen of stretch.","The 12 fit, but the 14 was more flattering on my curvy (wide-hipped) figure."
"date","This is a super tight fitting material-think spandex - but it is extremely thick and of a high quality, keeping everything in place without seeing wrinkles or underwear lines.","It fit really well, I wasnt popping out despite my being a 34D, and at 55 it was the perfect length with a low heel.","I am 112-114 lbs and of athletic build for reference.","I wouldnt recommend this length for anyone with any amount of hips (I have none) as it will significantly cinch the pant legs up.","Got a lot of compliments!","Only con is, as everyone has said, difficulty in pulling it down to use the restroom, but I did it - with a 1 year old in my arms- so you can make it work if you want it badly enough (and you should!)","Would definitely rent again."
"date","This dress makes your curves look phenomenal!","It fits a little small on the rib cage/chest area so ladies with a larger bust ,might need to size up (I am 34C).","I didnt wear a bra and needed my husbands help zipping the dress up but I must say it was worth the effort.","The color is a maroon/burgundy tone that is perfect for fall.","I paired it with the Rebecca Minkoff blush jacket and nude shoes for an outfit to remember.","I would love to rent this dress again!"
"date","Operas are hard because some people go super formal and others go casual.","This dress cut right down the middle-- the length was casual, but the detailing and fabric was formal.","Fabric was thick and heavy, great for winter, and the dress was lovely and very flattering."
"date","I rented this dress for my 40th birthday.","I usually wear a medium, but there were only smalls available on the date I needed.","I went ahead and rented it, but chose a back-up dress just in case.","To my delight it fit GREAT.","The dress has just enough stretch that a small was actually perfect.","The compliments were endless and made me feel fabulous on my 40th!","THANK YOU RTR!"
"date","based on reviews I ordered an XS even though im usually an S/size 4. it was still a bit large, but the top fit ok.","I would recommend going down at least 1 size for this dress.","I found the armholes to be a little large so opted to wear a crew neck long sleeve black shirt underneath and it looked awesome!","ended up looking like a colorblock dress.","hit mid thigh, need to wear a strapless.","color is great, not the most flattering for my body type."
"date","This dress was really cute.","I rented this because I thought I could wear a normal bra with it, but with the size 2 it ended up showing a little through the cuts in the side.","So I went up to the 4 and it didnt show.","The black is the 2, I ended up wearing the 4  in Pink.","It was perfect for date night!"
"date","I really loved this dress.","I wore it to a celebratory date with my husband at a fancy restaurant.","I planned to wear the six, but it arrived with a broken clasp, so I opted for the four, which was fine.","The whole dress fit very comfortably, including the numerous straps.","Really enjoyed wearing this."
"date","Wore it for a dinner date with my husband in Vegas and he was totally floored!",":) :)Love love loved the turquoise color and the feel of the fabric.","I ordered it when there was no review on the site and was pleasantly surprised with the look of the dress.","I normally wear size 8 and hadnt ordered a backup.","The size 8 was lil body hugging near the tummy and I would have loved to get size 10.","But still went ahead with a Spanx because it was so beautiful!","I wish I didnt have to return it...","But overall a gorgeous dress!"
"date","I liked this dress a lot.","The fabric was thick and the lace was pretty.","The dress hit me around the bottom of my knees.","I found that the color was darker in person than how it appears in the models photo.","My only complaint is that the waist is not very well-defined on this dress, so it wasnt snug enough around the middle section for me in order to show off the see through section of the dress."
"date","Despite being listed in the category for Full Bust, there is not ample room for an actual full bust.","I usually wear size 6, and the dress fit me at the waist and hips, but barely zipped over my chest, even without a bra.","I am a size 38E.","There is no stretch, either.","Otherwise, the dress is lovely, with an elegant pattern that isnt too showy.","It hit me right at the knee."
"date","Loved the fun print on this dress (and the pockets) but I really should have returned it for another size.","the top felt like it ran very large and the straps ended up being about 1.5 inches too long on me.","I will say, its more beautiful in person.","The fabric has some sparkle, and the waist band is crystals.","I would rent again, and for sure size down on this one."
"date","This dress had caught my eye for a while and I finally got it in my size.","Its a fun, trendy dress that I was able to wear a few times, mostly for dinner dates.","I paired the simple, but on trend dress with some espadrilles one time and with heels another.","The dress does have slits on the side which did make it feel a bit short for me at 5 11."
"date","The quality of the material doesnt seem to be holding-up to multiple dry-cleanings.","It looked a bit worn and faded as a result.","Otherwise, its a cute, conservative cut and fun pattern.","I wore it to go to dinner and cha-cha dancing!"
"date","Love this fun dress for the fall!","The simple floral print makes it super wearable even if you dont normally wear print.","The material is amazing quality and stretches to hug your body in all the right places.","I would recommend you to size up if you are curvier in the hips and this should be worn with a strapless bra!","At 56, it comes up to about tea length for me which makes this the perfect dress for this upcoming season.","Cant wait to style this with some black heels for my next date!"
"date","Fit perfectly everywhere except the bust area.","The front gaped and showed my regular bra, so I chose to wear a black bandeau bra underneath that peaked out the top and kept it modest.","I have a little poochy baby belly, so I chose to wear shape wear as well.","In the winter I usually wear tights with DVF dresses, and that does the trick too."
"date","I wish I had a photo.","I actually didnt end up wearing this, due to lack of time on a busy vacation schedule.","But I did try it on, and I loved it.","I could even go bra-less, which is rare for my bra size."
"date","Its a slip dress so every little thing shows, you have to be comfortable w that.","Its a beautiful color - almost dark blue.","It pretty much looks just like the model on.","No bra can be worn w this.","I wish I had taken a picture."
"date","I wanted to try something outside of my comfort range, but this didnt work for me.","It kept riding up on my shoulders so I didnt get the off-the shoulder look I wanted and the fabric on the left side of the neckline would not stay flat, which made the neckline look uneven.","It didnt look terrible, but this is definitely a statement top and I think I wasnt comfortable standing out that much."
"date","Runs large, I normally wear an 8-10, and I read the reviews so I ordered an 8 and a 6.","I could have worn a 4, but the 6 fit fine, it didnt gape at the armpits or anything, I just feel like a 4 would have been a little more flattering.","The color was beautiful, it was a nice sturdy material.","The neckline was beautiful.","I wish it had pockets."
"date","This dress- like most Elizabeth and James fits a little small but once you find the right size its amazing.","It hugged every curve ( I have few lol) and I got compliments every 5 minutes.","The color is steel blue-ish with a hint of green.","Im contemplating buying it just to own it."
"date","Beautiful!!!","One of my favorite dresses.","Love the color and the lace.","This dress is completely covered in lace, so there is no stretch.","At 5’6”, this came to 3 inches above my knee.","I love the high neck and sleeve designs.","There is also a triangle cutout in the back and four buttons!","We definitely recommend sizing up for this style.","I would wear this on a date or to a wedding.","Pair with 3 inch heels and earrings!"
"date","This dress is nothing short of stunning!!","The color, the fit, the texture,  the peekaboo in the front.","It truly is a show stopper!!","I have triple Ds and did not wear a bra and felt comfortable!","The color is a gorgeous emerald and is super vibrant!","The cap sleeves were perfect!!","The waist had little vivre but ran true to size.","I would size up for the backup."
"date","This dress was perfect!","I had wanted something I would be conformable in to go see a Broadway play with my girlfriends, and this dress was great!","It was very flattering on me, I just had a baby not to long ago and still have the pouch, and this dress made me feel pretty again!","It does run a little on the larger size, I have been in a size 14 post baby and I rented a 10 after reading the reviews and it fit perfect for me, but I dont think you are supposed to really tighten the strings on it, I think the dress is meant to be a little lose.","I would totally rent this again!"
"date","I wore this to take my boyfriend out in the city for dinner.","I almost wish I ordered a size larger as it was SO TIGHT FITTING.","It felt painted on to my body!","It is a sexy, stunning dress and I felt gorgeous in it!","Would rent it again (one size up though!)"
"date","This dress was gorgeous but Im 511 and it didnt hit me quite where I wanted it to.","I think this is a great dress, just didnt wow me."
"everyday","I love this jacket but should have ordered the Medium.","I ordered the Large since a previous leather bomber jacket I ordered in Medium was quite small.","This one was very large, though.","Even with a heavy sweater under it, the waistband was very loose and the overall fit very big.","I suggest going down a size if you want it to fit as a bomber jacket.","The leather is gorgeous though!"
"everyday","I didnt end up wearing this dress, because I needed to send it back to swap it in on something else quickly.","Its very nicely made, very comfortable, and great classic styling.","A terrific spring look.","My only complaint is that it was a little high waisted for me, but thats a pretty regular occurrence in dresses that dont come in a long option.","Highly recommend this one!"
"everyday","I loved this dress and kept it for a long time.","Very very comfortable and perfect for everyday wear (I love in Florida.)","I think I got at least one compliment each day that I wore it."
"everyday","Absolutely loved this Kate Spade romper!","Being almost 6 feet tall, rompers rarely work for me but this one fit perfectly!","The shorts are a bit on the longer side and the waistband was elastic, making it easy to place at the most flattering part of your torso.","+ there are pockets, always a win."
"everyday","One of the most comfortable and flattering jumpsuits Ive worn.","It runs large but I wouldnt have preferred a smaller size because I think the loose fits works.","The drawstring makes this look good on anyone.","Love the color but will probably rent again in the white.","Fabric is on the heavier side so not the greatest in hot weather."
"everyday","The quality shows in this romper.","It fits a womens figure beautifully from the bust, to the waist, to the hips!","Its perfect for a Sunday brunch or exploring a new town.","Easy and breezy.","Heads up, the neck line does come a little low but theres nothing double sided tape cant do!"
"everyday","Its gorgeous.","Requires a cami under it or something as it is sheer.","Wore it out in NYC during a spring trip, with a pink cami under it, and match my lipstick to the pink.","Was perfect with white jeans.","Would wear again, rent again, and probably even buy it!","Its flowy also, so if you go out for a big dinner, you dont have to worry."
"everyday","I loved this jacket so much--rented it as part of my unlimited subscription and wore it multiple times.","I wore it with pants and a t-shirt to a kids birthday party, over a dress to church, and with a skirt and blouse to work.","The cut is fairly tailored, but the fabric adds an element of fun beyond a regular navy blazer.","Its not terribly warm, though, so save as an outer layer until the weather outside is temperate."
"everyday","I have a larger chest, and this fit me perfectly!","I did wear a cami underneath it to not show cleavage at work - but wouldnt need one for the weekend.","The material is super soft and the tie-waist is so flattering.","Can be dressed up or down to be worn with dress pants or jean shorts.","Its even prettier in person as there is a small crochet detail at the shoulders that is hard to see in photos.","Highly recommend for spring, summer, or fall!"
"everyday","I loved the feminine look of this on the model but ended up not wearing this one as it was quite a bit puffier and prince-like in person.","If you are going for something very girly, almost poodle skirt flirty this is a great pick but if you are on the fence about how frilly this is you may want to pass as it is certainly more so in person.","The material was lovely and the piece was very high quality."
"everyday","The jacket is oversized but runs a little big.","Im in between sizes 8-10, but since Im on unlimited, I tend to size up to be on the safe side that an item fits.","That being said, this one did feel a little too big for a size 10 (even if its an oversized design).","Ill rent a size smaller (8) next time, but for the day that I did wear it, I received several compliments.","I couldnt tell whether the fabric was overworn or thats how it is supposed to appear, so Ill have to try a different size and get back to folks."
"everyday","I loved this dress but I sized up as people suggested and it was a bit large.","Also, the sleeves were sooooooo long that I had to roll them up!","I wore it to work with burgundy tights and did receive a lot of compliments."
"everyday","This is one of my favorite dresses ever.","Its comfortable, loose and flowy, but is also extremely flattering.","The fabric is great - beautiful, delicate pattern and wrinkle free.","I wore for everyday but bought it and plan to wear to my bridal shower."
"everyday","This is a great casual dress with a few little details that make it fun to wear.","I liked the structure of the waist and the sleeves.","The neckline is flattering and the fabric is soft and comfortable.","A nice day dress!"
"everyday","I think that  I could have sized down and got the XS.","I thought that it ran a little large.","I am 54 and wore wedges and the length was perfect in the S.  I did wear a black cami under this bc I was attending afternoon casual but semi conservative event and it made me more comfortable.","This is such a cute, casual and comfortable outfit."
"everyday","I have an athletic shape and the shirt was fitted in the shoulders for me- a larger size would have compensated for that.","But as the previous reviewer mentioned, the shirt has no shape and is really boxy.","I also did not like the collar fit on me (maybe my neck is too short).","Shirt would also look better with the matching pants.","I did not wear it."
"everyday","I typically wear between a 2 and 4 and the 36 fit great.","The sleeves/shoulders ran a bit on the tighter side, so if you are planning to wear a heavier sweater underneath Id size up.","Its a good coat for 40 degree weather (so spring/fall).","The fit of the coat is a bit on the boxy side, so you do need the belt to cinch and define the waist.","It has a cool military vibe and the leather details give it a more luxurious feel.","I rented through Unlimited and only returned as I needed the space to rent a gown for an event, will be renting again ASAP and holding onto for awhile."
"everyday","I thought with the oversize fit this would run large.","I was wrong.","Should have ordered a medium.","Was very tight across top of arms and restricted movement.","Gorgeous top though.","Many compliments from the husband."
"everyday","I absolutely loved this dress!","The pattern matched with the tiny pleats was beautiful and the tasteful cutouts at the top made this still feel like a youthful style despite the length.","I would definitely  recommend that anyone considering renting this piece size up, however.","My measurements are H: 34, W:24 B: 34 and this was comfortable at my waist, tight at my bust and there was no stretch in the top of the dress..","If I were to rent this again, I would probably do the size 2 rather than the 0.","Also, at 55 this came to my ankles, so for more petite women this could easily become a floor length style.","I wore this with black ankle boots, but as the weather warms up this would look beautiful with a nude or black strappy sandal and simple jewelry."
"everyday","This coat is so beautiful and perfect for every occasion.","The fur collar is detachable, but I would never detach it because of how much I love it.","I think this coat can be dressed up or down, it has a loose fit but it looks very chic and stylish.","It is not super warm, but with another later underneath or a scarf can be comfortably for a NY winter night."
"everyday","Rented this for everyday/ weekend getaway in the late Spring and got so many compliments!","A-line shape is very flattering for girls without much of a waist, and the cut on the arms makes your shoulders look toned!","Im a true 4 and the dress fit me perfectly- only problem was that the band got a little tight after a large brunch.",":) Didnt need to wear a bra, as the fabric is quite thick.","Great casual/ vacation running around dress!","Def would rent again."
"everyday","Im typically a 6-8 and I got a 4 and it worked for me.","I dont have a huge chest area though, so perhaps thats why I didnt have an issue.","I also recommend this dress for taller women as well.","The fabric is a bit thicker, so itd be better for a summer evening.","I ended up not wearing this dress because I didnt like how the front of the dress pleated, it looked a bit awkward.","I can tell that this dress could be cute too, just wasnt for me.","4 stars!"
"everyday","I rented this after seeing it worked well for another new mom.","I think it just hit me in the wrong places because of my height.","The elastic waistband just fell on the worst place I think it could have.","Super cute and soft fabric, though!"
"everyday","I LOVED this romper!","Thought about buying....gorgeous color, great fit.","Can easily dress up or down.","Only downside is it is low cut.","Maybe I just dont have enough of a chest to fill it out, but did struggle with showing my bra.","A great rental!"
"everyday","I rented this for a brunch with the girls but winded up returning it.","I am bustier so this may be a better shirt for someone with less of that going on, but for me it showed WAY too much and was impossible to get on by myself (dont rent if you dont live with someone).","The sides tie together.","It is short and I tried to on with jeans but if just made me look frumpy."
"everyday","i cannot get over how amazing this piece is!!!","the color is gorgeous, the material is amazing, and it is just so so well made.","i am usually btwn a 2 and 4, but sound the S to be a bit too big.","i know it isnt supposed to be tight, but when buttoned up it just had too much room around the chest so i will def try the XS next time.","this is the perfect fall piece.","i had leggings, flats, and a plain T, but throwing this over that really made the outfit.","it is def something you want to wear to an outdoor event so you dont need to take it off.","the pockets are also awesome.","i really cant say enough about this.","i am very seriously considering purchasing it!"
"everyday","The material for this skirt was very well constructed.","The 6R sent was a size small, so had I known that I would have sized up to get a medium, but besides that, it seems to be TTS.","Im 58 and the skirt was nearly ankle length on me and I had it at my belly button, if not higher.","The Medium would have been better."
"everyday","Ran small, nothing too exciting about this.","The white part is see-through.","I was a little self conscious of my belly button being visible through the sheer, but the shirt ran so small that I couldnt wear a tank underneath it.","I wouldnt recommend this shirt."
"everyday","The sleeve on me was definitely 3/4 length, but with the fun styling of the sleeve was not an issue.","I am small busted and small framed and the Medium was definitely fitted.","Material could be softer and I would have loved it even more."
"everyday","Way to big, should have gone with a size 0.","The coat is beautiful and fun, loved the hot pink lining.","Sent back because I looked like I was swimming.","I am a size 4-6 in clothes, this coat runs super big."
"everyday","Unless youre going for the I-can-see-your-bra look, you definitely need to wear an undershirt with this one since the fabric is tissue-paper thin--dont let the bold pattern fool you in the low lighting of your bedroom!","Also, although I sized up, this runs pretty short in the body and sleeves."
"everyday","The fabric is so soft and sits perfectly even with the pockets.","I was a little worried about the busy pattern but the tailored look of this dress won me over.","Its fitted up top and through arms (Im a true 0) but the bottom half is forgiving.","It leaves room for you to eat without worrying but not so bulky that you look frumpy.","Rent this!"
"everyday","I was looking for a better cut of the jacket.","I have the expectation of a narrower waist on this kind of jacket.","The waist seemed to be big for the size of the jacket.","Others may not notice, but this is something Im rather picky about.","Other than the fit, the color is great!","I ended up not wearing it due to the fit & that I have a similar coat in a lighter color and went with that."
"everyday","I rented a medium, which is fine, but the small would have been ideal.","I have wore it multiple times...a night out in NYC with black ripped jeans and black heeled booties, running errands with dark-washed jeans and a leather bomber jacket etc...","I will rent this again, but in a small."
"everyday","The fit was comfy without being too baggy.","The knit was high-quality so it was not necessary to wear a tank top underneath.","The beads are a little more noticeable than I had expected, so this sweater does make a bit of a statement."
"everyday","This coat was simply adorable.","Each time I wore it out I received compliments.","Be it at the grocery store, at church or picking up the kids, people consistently complimented me on this coat.","The top is quite a bit form fitting so I wouldnt recommend wearing this if you are planning to sport multiple layers underneath.","I found the weight to be great for fall, but not a heavy jacket for winter.","Overall, one of my favorite rentals."
"everyday","TTS fit that likely works best for average or tall women without a large bust (as it is cut quite low in the front).","I packed it in a suitcase and it traveled well....it also looked pretty cute with a black cami underneath for work.","I *loved* the movement of the pleats and the layers.","Great dress!"
"everyday","This is a very nicely made fitted sheath, with some give to it to the fabric.","This is a thinner jersey than some Mischkas.","Bust fit perfectly and roomy in the hips, but Im straight up and down.","If you are bustier you might want to size up.","Id like to buy it.","Great dress and just my style."
"everyday","Very modern.","Great fabric, great fit and very flattering.","I wore it to work and make it more causal with sandals and a coral necklace.","Loved it and could have easily dressed it up for a wedding or evening event."
"everyday","Style this dress up or down, great for a city chic sporty look with the mesh details.","I am quite petite in size, so the dress was a perfect length on me, but for taller people I would recommend the next size up."
"everyday","If youre short or short-waisted, this top is for you!","For me, though, it is not a good look.","Too short, and not in a cute way.","Kind of makes me look at least 5 months pregnant because of where the bottom of the blouse hits.","The quality, though, is A+++++.","I wish it were longer!"
"everyday","Simple but lovely little crop top.","The flowing bottom ruffle actual just covered my mid section, but if I lifted my arms,  skin would peek through on bottom portion.","Had I worn high waisted pants, this could have easily resolved the issue.","Top is very versatile and looks great with anything from jeans, to white shorts or pants.","High quality fabric, no wrinkling noted even after 4 hours."
"everyday","I got so many compliments on this dress!","It was a little on the short side on the sides so I wore it with black stockings for work and then took them off after for happy hour!","I loved this dress so much; it is going to be hard to part with it to send it back!"
"everyday","I loved this dress!","It does run a little big, so it was slightly boxy on me, but I wore it anyway because it was SO comfortable and still very cute.","Next time I would go with an XS.","Perfect dress for a daytime event or date!"
"everyday","This romper is super cute!","The fabric is light, perfect to be worn in a Summer day.","I used while spending a weekend in Boston and it was great for the entire day.","Three points to keep in mind, though: (1) it closes in the back, with three buttons, so there is absolutely NO WAY youll be able to do this yourself.","Youll need another person to close it for you.","(2) Youll need a friend to help you every time you go to the bathroom.","Theres a zipper in the shorts, but you have to be fairly flexible to pull it down without taking to top off.","(3) The elastic band is right in your waist, so it will emphasize if you have a slight bump below your bellybutton.","Other than that, I really liked it."
"everyday","Great print!","With room in the arms, waist, and bust and no stretch to the fabric Id recommend ordering your true size.","Definitely on the longer side, this top looks great with pants or leggings for a more casual look.","Comfy and breezy, would love to own!"
"everyday","This fit is great for essentially any body type, and can be dressed up or down very easily.","The collar and wrist cuffs were lacier than I expected them to be, but it was a nice touch.","The sleeves stop just before the wrists, so may be shorter for those with long arms.","The length of the skirt is fine for both work and play, with a movable, comfortable material that is stretchy enough to be flexible while still hiding less flattering flab."
"everyday","I loved this top.","As a short-waisted person, I struggle to find crop tops that fit properly.","This top showed just the right amount of midriff without being inappropriate.","Great choice for petites."
"everyday","Fit was tight in the bust/waist (zero was true to size).","It was basically an A-line fit with flared bottom half, making it very comfortable.","If you have a larger bust/upper frame, I would recommend sizing up at least for a backup size."
"everyday","This fits very well and is flattering.","Even when I felt a little bloated it was a flattering cut.","I got compliments even from men.","It just has a very high quality look.","Something I would consider buying."
"formal affair","The only thing that bothered by about this dress was that the shoulders didnt stay on very well since the open back didnt have any way of keeping them in place.","It wasnt a huge deal to adjust it every once in a while, but other than that- I loved it!","MUCH more sparkly in person!","Photos make it look like it is not, but especially at night this dress sparkles when you walk.","Loved it."
"formal affair","This dress fit well and flattering to the figure.","Im 57 so the length was perfect on me.","What I loved most were the sleeves but I must admit getting a bra to fit perfectly was challenging since the bust line is slightly low.","Overall, great for the benefit dinner I attended."
"formal affair","(Reviewing for my friend, her measurements above) This dress is breathtaking.","The lace detail is dramatic without being Gothic looking, and the dress is sexy while still being covered up.","Boning in the midsection and stretch throughout makes for a perfect fit."
"formal affair","The fit was perfect in the sleeves, waist and length.","The only caveat was the slip underneath which was too big.","However, the netting concealed it perfectly.","I loved the dress and it was a huge success!","I highly recommend it for semi-formal and formal events.","Its perfect for the lady who wants to make a statement and turn heads."
"formal affair","Such a comfortable dress!","I loved the fabric and cut.","The pockets were deep enough for my phone.","I sat, stood, and danced and was never afraid of it falling out.","I only wore 2 inch heels.","It was just a little long, but I liked the effect when I was standing still.","I was very sad to send this dress back."
"formal affair","If anything, it was a little loose.","The back had some extra space, which wasnt a problem while wearing it, and I taped the front to avoid gaping because its pretty open.","I thought I had ordered a backup, sized up, but it never came so Im glad the 12 fit!","I would size down from your regular size as a backup."
"formal affair","I am normally a size 0, but the 2 fit perfect!","I sized up based on other reviews.","I wore this to a wedding rehearsal dinner and received many compliments!","It fit like a glove.","Would definitely recommend!"
"formal affair","PERFECT dress for New Years Eve!","The fit was amazing and made me feel so glamorous and confident.","I got so many compliments!","if you need a dress for a birthday celebration or special night out this is it!"
"formal affair","I was asked to attend a very formal event one week before it happened!","Needless to say I was extremely stressed.","I had never used rent the runway but decided to try it out.","Not only did I get the dress I wanted, but my anxiety of finding a dress in such a short amount of time was eliminated.","I loved reading the reviews and experiences everyone had.","I got sooooo many compliments about my dress!","It was sooo comfortable and I couldnt have been happier with my choice.","It is a little revealing in the top area so getting the double sided tape was necessary.","Other than that it was perfect for my magical evening :)"
"formal affair","This dress is just gorgeous!","The colors the fi,t everything screams glamour!","It is form fitting but comfortable and thick enough to hide my love handles.","I usually wear size 12 on evening gowns and the XL was perfect.","I have broad shoulders and narrow hips but thanks to the stretch of the material it fit perfectly!!","!"
"formal affair","Let me start by saying I ordered this dress because I was 16 weeks pregnant at the time.","So if you are looking for something bump friendly this is a good option.","I wore this with 3 inch heels and it was also the perfect length for my 54 height.","I have larger boobs now being pregnant so I did have to pin the top a little but that was no big deal.","I also loved that it had pockets.","I had plenty of compliments about looking good but not specifically on the dress.","This is a pretty dress and it worked just fine but I have loved others more.","Thats just my personal preference but overall a great dress."
"formal affair","The dress is very flattering, as it has rouching in all the right places.","Your curves will be accented.","I ordered the petite and the length worked great, even with smaller heel (Im 5 1).","I was comfortable all night long."
"formal affair","Gorgeous dress!","Very flattering and easy to wear.","The crocheted flowers are amazing.","The fabric does have some stretch to it, comfy.","The color is a gorgeous magenta pink.","The length was good for me, 55."
"formal affair","The fit and length of the dress was perfect!","It hugged all the right curves and was a huge standout!","I did not have to wear a bra with this dress because the material was thick, and kept everything in place!","The lace of this dress is beautiful as well, it makes the dress unique!","I was receiving compliments all night!","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!"
"formal affair","Lovely dress, loved how theres an elegant train that flows beautifully as you walk.","Runs rather tight and the straps were an awkward length for a small-busted girl like me, so they were slightly lifted above my shoulders.","Definitely get a size up from what you usually wear.","Otherwise, highly recommend!","Wore this to the opening night gala for SF Opera, so the reception and theater were full of extremely well-dressed people, but many women (and some men) came up to me to make a point of telling me how beautiful this dress was!"
"formal affair","Beautiful, attention-grabbing dress.","Lots of compliments and very comfortable to dance in.","The only thing I would say is that it might have even been TOO attention-grabbing.","It had a lower cut than I thought and I was hyper-aware of whether or not people could see my bra all night.","Overall a really great party dress though."
"formal affair","The dress is way better in person and pictures dont really do it justice.","Its perfect for a formal events.","Very comfortable, material is giving in all the right places, and the lace detail is just enough to catch everyones eye!","I received tons of compliments!","Only kicker is to be careful about the shoes you wear/tripping.","Im a bit clumsy and almost ate it a few times!",":) Otherwise Id definitely rent it again!"
"formal affair","Its really hard to describe how this dress fits.","The open back is very very loose but the bust is oddly tight.","The length is also a bit tricky to sort out.","Not my favorite RTR experience but not terrible."
"formal affair","The dress was stunning and an ABSOLUTE HIT!","I received compliments all evening on the unique design, elegance, and fit (and this was a very well-dressed crowd).","The waist is quite narrow, so consider going a size up."
"formal affair","I got this as my back up dress, and it was just slightly too short to wear since my shoes (I wore flats) werent anything special.","It would have been fine if I had wanted to show off my shoes, but it was probably a half inch off of the floor, and I like dresses to skim the ground.","Im typically a size 10, but this gown was only available in an 8 - it still fit, but it was on the tighter side.","Still very flattering!","The straps on the back didnt lay perfectly flat, but they didnt look awkward.","I went with the Monique Lhuillier Pomegranate Gown instead in a size 10, and it was perfect!"
"formal affair","The dress was fabulous.","I rented both the 12 and 14.","The 12 was a bit snug right in the armpit area but would have fit otherwise.","The 14 gave me that extra room and still looked great.","I received compliments all night long and on social media once I posted pictures.","It runs shorts for sure.","Im 55 and wore 3 1/2 heels and it was really a little shorter than I normally like.","It just barely brushed the top of my shoes.","The sequins were a little itchy and my hair kept sticking to them!","But, it was so gorgeous and I felt so great that it was worth it!","Id definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","The dress actually fit ok, I think my overall issue was with the length.","I am 56 and it barely hit my ankles so that just made it ill-fitting.","Material is great though, very breathable, especially nice in the summer time!","I would say though that the dress is definitely made for a curvy body, and someone that is full chested."
"formal affair","This dress was beautiful on.","The material is thick and stretchy.","It was February when I wore it, so I was warm in this dress.","it was very form-fitting.","I am tall, so I was worried about length.","It was a little short for my comfort, but I loved it so much that I didnt want to waste it.","I usually am a Medium but opted for the Large in this dress (thank goodness i ordered two sizes!).","The medium was just too small.","I received compliment after compliment and felt beautiful the whole evening."
"formal affair","The fit was a true size 8, I have a pear shape so below the waist rules what fits and what does not.","The dress allows you to walk and dance.","I am 5-3 and had to add a 3 hem  which allowed me to walk without the gown dragging on the floor.","My heel was about 2... it was a long night.","Strapless bra is the way to go, but you cant clip the front (the clear clip shows).","Thinking about renting this again for a November fundraiser."
"formal affair","I LOVED this dress.","Incredibly comfortable.","I ordered a 6 with a 4 being my backup.","The 6 fit fine, but the straps felt too long and I knew it would drive me crazy all night, plus it was a little looser than Id wanted.","The 4 was a little more snug, but hugged my body perfectly.","The straps were hardly an issue, though they did slip a few times when I was dancing.","I wore 3 inch heels and the length of the dress was perfect, just grazing the floor.","Really have no complaints, only that if you are going to an event on a hot day (as I did), the fabric is thicker than youd expect.","Also I wore spanx under my dress, and felt like I could see them through the lining at certain points.","All in all, I was really sad to return this one since Id love to have it in my closet.","HIGHLY recommend it for any formal affair or black tie optional event."
"formal affair","Fit great, true to my size.","A little bit longer than expected, but it worked well.","Covered my chest well, the sequins werent annoying or scratchy, which is normally how sequins are on clothing.","Overall just a beautiful and classy dress."
"formal affair","This dress was amazing.","The interesting part is that it isnt form-fitting around the waist, which usually makes me look dumpy, but everyone was saying how flattering it was on my curvy figure and someone even asked me if I had lost weight!","The short length made it just flirty enough for a work event - showing off legs - without being inappropriate.","The only snag with it, is that it did snag a few times on my rings, and on the button of a mans suit!"
"formal affair","The fit was perfect and it was very comfortable.","The material was flexible and hugged me in all the right places, making it appear that I had more curves than I really do have.","I did not need to wear a bra with it at all and had no worries about it slipping down around the bust.","My actual height is 57 1/2 and in reading some of the reviews I decided to order the long, which I do believe the regular length would have been fine because I had to pull it up a bit when I walked and danced, but it still looked as elegant as I had hoped.","The color popped and received many compliments."
"formal affair","My dad got the Kennedy Center Medal of Honor in DC and I wanted something sparkly to wear to the event.","This did the trick.","Everybody loved this dress.","Someone even thought I could double as the actual Oscar award I was so gold and shiny.","This dress is so comfortable and easy to wear I could have worn it to bed.","It wasnt as long as Id hoped so if youre over 510 even the L will be too short."
"formal affair","I ordered both the 10L and 12L for length, which fit perfectly.","Im 56 and needed the long with 4 heels - It would barely touch the floor in the front with a demi-train in the back.","I normally  wear a 12 because of my large chest and bottom, but the 12L fit was definitely roomy in all areas, especially in the midsection.","I would size down with this dress.","The material is thick with a silk lining but can show every bump, lump, lining of your shapewear or undergarments.","That was my only issue in this gown!","Otherwise, its absolutely gorgeous and timeless with a touch of elegance.","I had so many compliments on how this fit on me as an hourglass figure and it felt incredibly comfortable and beautiful on."
"formal affair","I didnt love this dress.","I am very small-chested and the bodice was very tight, I usually wear a 2 in dresses fitted on top, Im bigger on bottom, but I didnt even try the 2 on after trying the 4.","What I didnt like was the way the body of the dress fits over the hips - it is fitted halfway down the thigh - and then the skirt comes out.","I felt like I was wearing an unflattering 1950s swimsuit with a little skirt tacked on.","Instead of drawing the eye to my small upper half, I felt like it drew the eye right to my heavier bottom half - not the look I was going for."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for my senior prom and I absolutely loved it!","I got a million compliments and didnt have a single issue with it.","Renting it was so smart because when will I ever need to wear my prom dress again?","(even though I hated returning it because I loved it so much).","Will definitely rent from Rent the Runway again!"
"formal affair","My original dress I wanted to wear was delayed so I had to pick back ups.","This was one of them that I chose.","I am glad I did!","If you cant find another dress this dress is sure to look great and be perfect for the occasion.","I probably could have gone with a long but would have had to wear 3+ heal and I am not one for tall heals so this one was perfect."
"formal affair","This is THE dress.","Want to look and feel like a million bucks?","This is the one.","Form fitting and flattering - my girls and booty looked awesome while my less than flat belly was hidden.","I am 54 and wore two inch heels - which were perfect.","I think taller heels would have made the dress look too short, so be aware.","I cannot even begin to express how much I loved this dress!","The only complaint was that the hanger loops kept coming out all night.","Tape those down and youll love it!"
"formal affair","I ordered a size 2 and 4 for backup, the dress was beautiful in person and the fabric was very forgiving, but the top was just weird.","I honestly could have fit in a 0 or even 00 (f they made that) because while the bottom flared out nicely, the top was so big that I had to stuff my bra with cutlets and tissue paper to fill it out and it was still loose in the rib cage area.","Like other reviewers, the top half is cut uniquely under the arms but this makes for a very interesting challenge when choosing a bra to wear.","I ended up not wearing it to my event because it was just too strange a fit for me.","Definitely size down in this dress and probably would have worn it if I did."
"formal affair","The color of this dress is stunning, but it was too long for me (even with 3 heels) and felt a bit bridesmaid-y.","That said, it will cover any problem areas you may have and the fabric ships well (not too wrinkly).","I dont have a particularly large chest, but do have a broader back, and this fit well up top."
"formal affair","Overall the dress is gorgeous, simple and elegant.","I am 56 and about 140 lbs and had to wear a size 12 because the dress is super fitted and does run pretty small.","I ended up not wearing this dress because this was a back-up Id ordered in case the other one didnt pan out, but it was a close call, I literally flipped a coin haha.","Would highly recommend this dress :)"
"formal affair","I just wore this dress to a wonderful charity event and was stopped by men and women who commented on this fabulous dress.","I was a walking ad for RTR that evening and spread the word.","There were over 1200 attendees.","The other two dresses I ordered were equally terrific; however, there was a band with a great light show and dancing, so the sparkles won out.","LOVED IT!","Also, the return was so easy.","Thank you!!","A new customer!"
"formal affair","The fit was pretty good but Im a bit smaller in the bust and there was the usual constant pulling up that you get with a strapless dress.","On the bright side, judging by my boyfriends face when he picked me up he really liked it."
"formal affair","This dress is amazing.","Its sexy in all the right places, while also being comfortable.","I was able to wear a regular bra, as well, which was a huge plus.","I got many compliments from both men and women and I felt extremely special at an event I needed to be at.","I am thinking about renting it again for a wedding I will be attending in August."
"formal affair","Great, great, great dress!","The fabric is just lovely.","It is comfortable!","And everyone adored the dress.","If you are going to wear Spanx or tummy control, do know the inset is sheer, so they cant be too high-rise.","I wish the neckline had a slightly neater finish to it.","I opted not to wear a necklace and wish I had.","So dont hesitate to try a collar-style necklace.","I felt like a million dollars, and was so happy I had rented from RTR when I saw the major investment some of the other ladies made in serious statement dresses, which everyone will remember the next time they have to wear them!"
"formal affair","This dress was amazing and I got so many compliments on it.","If youre one person for glitz and sparkles, this is definitely the dress for you.","I would recommend getting a larger size than you actually are because the zipper is tough to close around the waist.","Other than the zipper, I could not have asked for a more perfect prom dress to complete my perfect night."
"formal affair","There is no stretch to the dress.","It fit like glove and definitely kept my posture in check even after dinner.","This works for a professional event--just use your dinner napkin strategically when seated."
"formal affair","I really felt special for the event I attended.","I needed accoutrements to fill out the bust, but in the end it all worked out.","So many people came up to me asking where I got the dress and how much they loved it.","A few even said they would have voted me Best Dressed!","Thanks RTR!"
"formal affair","The dress fit beautifully from head to toe.","Because Im so short, it wasnt a mini dress but was still short enough that it didnt require any hemming.","The sleeves were a fantastic detail that transformed it from a simple black sheath to a fun party dress.","Would definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","This dress was my last minute choice that RTR overnighted to me (thank you thank you thank you!!)","when my original picks fit me horribly and the only one that worked was unfortunately damaged.","I am typically between a 16/18 and it can swing either way depending on the brand.","Based other reviews, I sized up and it fit perfectly.","It was a little long, but once I put on 3.75 heels, it grazed the floor beautifully.","As other reviews do mention, the waistband is a little snug, but not uncomfortable.","I actually liked the snugness as it forced me to have better posture all night.","I got so many compliments through out the night (especially since I was the only lady in the room in the stunning red), Im so glad I ended up wearing this dress!","Definitely loved!"
"formal affair","I ended up wearing my back-up dress instead of this one.","The dress was OK, but I felt like it lacked the wow factor - especially on a dark dance floor, the lace detailing wouldnt be visible, and it would look like any other long black dress.","Unfortunately it was also missing the belt, which is sort of key to giving it any shape.","If youre looking for a slightly more conservative formal gown, this might work well."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a formal gala event and received compliments on it all night long.","Im 59 1/2 and figured the dress would be too short or too tight, but the 10L worked perfectly.","It actually left me with a little bit of wiggle room in the bust area which was nice for dancing, but wasnt so loose that it was falling down.","I wore 3 1/2 inch heels and this ended up working out well.","I didnt feel like I was going to trip and fall over the gown throughout the night.","Would recommend this dress for any formal event!"
"formal affair","I loved wearing this dress.","It didnt photograph as well as some other dresses Ive rented and tried, but it looked spectacular in person.","the length is great, especially in these winter months, but the sheer fabric gives it a little sex appeal.","I wore the 6, because it fit me better on top, it was a little tight, but I liked it better.","Im usually between a 6 and a 10 depending on the designer and style"
"formal affair","I felt this ran true to size to slightly small.","I usually wear a size 2 and size up or down, pending reviews.","My second size was 0 and it was too small.","I have a very small chest and had a little difficulty filling this out properly, but using a stick on bra was very helpful.","I still received compliments all night."
"other","This dress fit great (the stretchy fabric helps with that) and extremely comfortable.","My shoulders were a bit too broad for the cap sleeves, so they kept riding up whenever I moved my arms.","The sheer quantity of lace is really dramatic, although I did wish that it had some variation in the lace or a few more embellishments.","You can wear a regular bra and panties, no problem."
"other","I wore this to a cocktail event.","It was comfortable, a nice fabric that you can appreciate more in person than online.","With some nice heels and jewelry, I got compliments and was comfortable.","It does run large though, so get one just below your size in case your true size fits too big."
"other","I wore this dress to church and loved it!","Everyone also loved it.","I got so many great comments.","The only thing that I felt a little something about was the fact that the lining was longer than the dress.","Other than that, it was a good rent."
"other","This was my first foray into the world of summer jumpsuits, and I  never looked back.","Its such a cool take on the standard dress for a party or a weekend night out.","This blue jumpsuit felt hip and different.","Its not quite as bright cobalt as in the official photo, but definitely not as dark as in mine.","(Im clearly taking this picture from a bathroom closet.)","It fit well, true to size, and was extremely comfortable!","You might be able to do a strapless bra if it lined up just perfectly, but Id plan to skip it if you can.","Would definitely rent again."
"other","This fluttery skirt is super cute in person.","The polkadot print is cheerful without being loud.","The background color was softly pink tinted.","Thankfully I read the reviews and saw that the waist runs small so I opted for a size up and it fit perfectly.","I very much enjoyed this flattering skirt."
"other","This dress was very comfortable and great to wear out to dinner & drinks.","The material was a little thicker so itd be good in the early fall.","I loved the cap sleeves and the pattern.","Was a nice change up from the standard LBD.","It was a little short when I was sitting for dinner but if you plan on standing and dancing the whole night, rent it!"
"other","The 38 Fit better overall, but the back didnt lay as flat as I would have liked.","The 40 was a bit loose.","The color was pretty but the only reason I ordered it was because my friend wanted the bridal party in a light blue for her shower.","I would have never rented it otherwise.","It was just ok, a little too stiff and modest for me."
"other","This fits true to size and I LOVED it!","Very complimentary.","I will rent over and over again once its spring...colors a little too bright for winter.","I am hour glass and the 6r fit me just fine.","Reviews are right, zipper is very tricky but once you get the hang of it youll be good the rest of the night.","Also spanx help"
"other","This jumpsuit was incredibly well tailored and well made.","It fit me perfectly, and I absolutely did not want to take it off!","The only problem I had was the torso is a bit short, so when you sit down it rides up a bit and the neck gets a little uncomfortable.","It was more of an annoyance than an actual problem.","Im usually a true 0 and the 2R fit great besides this one issue.","Also its tricky to find a bra that doesnt show, so I just wore a black razor back and the straps only poked out a few times, but it blended in mostly.","Not a problem really at all.","If you have a long torso I would  definitely recommend sizing up.","I also have long legs but the length of the pants was perfect, also loved the zipper detail.","Overall this was a fantastic rental, and PERFECT for seeing Wicked at the Fox Theatre!","I recommend renting for a fun and fancy event.","I dressed it up with a gold chain necklace and black suede pumps."
"other","This was a perfect dress for my Godsons 1st communion.","I received many compliments but the best part is it was very comfortable.","The only thing I would have changed is the volume of the upper portion that can add some unwanted size to the chest area but at the same time it balanced out the upper/lower body proportions.","From what Ive read in other reviews, what shoes to wear with this dress seems to be a big issue.","I wore with the TOMS strappy wedge in blue ikat.","The print not the shoe matched perfectly to the print on the sides of the dress and I was asked several times how I found shoes that did that."
"other","I rented this dress for a work charity function and it was perfect.","The cut flatters the body but isnt revealing or too sexy.","I could have worn the smaller size but the midsection on both dresses was snug so I went with the larger.","In terms of length, it hit just above my knees.","The crepe fabric is pretty forgiving and this could easily be dressed up or down.","Loved it!"
"other","I normally wear a size 4 or 6 US and I think this was a UK8 so it does run true to size.","I am a 36D and it was tight on the boobs but I didnt mind.","It really held me in.","Pattern is beautiful.","Dress is much prettier in person and even though it fits close to the body it is very easy to walk and move around in.","LOVED IT!"
"other","I was in charge of my best friends Bachlorette Party and the theme was pink and glitter.","So to surprise her, I got us both RTR sequin dress.","This dress was perfect for the occasion.","It fit like a glove and was very flattering.","The sequins did not rub or anything.","This was a great decision for the night."
"other","I rented this dress for Thanksgiving as part of the rent three for the price of one promotion that RTR was offering, and I was very happy with my rental.","I was a little nervous because there werent many reviews or pictures yet, but I think the dress was just a newer rental.","It was pretty form fitting but in a flattering way; the material was fairly forgiving as well (aka-stretched where it needed to stretch).","I was a little concerned about the arms being tight since that has been an issue for longer sleeved dresses for me in the past, but that was not the case.","I held back the fifth star because the zipper was a bit of a pain, and although I wore it with tights, I think it would have been itchy without them.","All in all, I would definitely think about renting this again."
"other","I actually chose this as a back up dress and had to find a place to go to wear it.","It was beautiful and I couldnt just send it back before wearing it out!","The only negative thing about this dress is that it is very long.","I had the regular and it was dragging on the ground even in heels.","I would definitely go for petite or short next time.","I am 52 Otherwise beautiful!"
"other","A modern twist on a LBD maxi dress!","Something that is really unique about this dress is the side slit and the see through paneling in the front bust area!","You will need to either go bra less or wear a Nubra with this dress as it is see through.","Although fairly fitted in the natural waist there is comfortable room in the hips.","You can complete this look with a statement earring and classy black stilettos!"
"other","The lace is classy and the open back is unique.","I havent worn it yet, but I bought it at a sample sale because I know I will have a couple of events coming up this year that I will wear the dress.","Beautiful navy color!","I plan on pairing it with a silver or gold clutch, simple earrings and evening sandals.","So glad I bought it and I paid a cheap price!"
"other","I am normally a 16 in jeans and blouses.","I ordered both the 16W and 18W dresses.","I tried on the 16W and it fit perfectly on top, but the bottom fit tightly around what my mom calls my perfect birthing hips.","So, I opted for the 18W since I was wearing this to my beautiful baby nieces (and now Goddaughters) Baptism and wasnt looking to bring the boys to the yard.","The 18W was a bit big up top.","So much so that every once in a while the zipper would bulge in the back and give me a hump.","It fit perfectly on the bottom, though, and it came down to right above my knees.","It was super comfortable material and the color was awesome!","I paired it with black heels and gold accessories.","I didnt even wear a necklace, since the neckline was set up high.","I received many compliments from both strangers and family.","This was my first rental and I will definitely rent again!"
"other","It has a beautiful color and sturdy, flawless fabric.","I ordered a medium because the small was unavailable but it worked overall because Herve dresses really hold their shape.","It was just a little loose in the tummy and chest but no one noticed.","Its a great length for short girls.","I wore it to a networking event and managed to look sexy but still put together."
"other","This dress is absolutely lovely.","The details are exquisite and the dress is very classy.","The reason for the 3 stars is that as a petite woman, I am just under 51, the dress at the top was very low cut.","The top of the dress also felt large and it kept coming off of my shoulders.","I ended up wearing a nude camisole underneath because the top of the dress exposed a lot of cleavage.","If I were had a long torso I would have been fine as it would have taken up the extra inch of dress at the top."
"other","The only issue was the cape kept falling off my shoulder.","Also, those hanger strings kept popping out.","The size 4 was too loose overall.","So I stuck it out with a 2 which was a little tight around my stomach area and hips but not unwearable.","Nothing a little tape cant fix!","!"
"other","I rented this for my grad school graduation ceremony, but I loved wearing it so much that I also wore it to a formal dinner.","The legs are LOOOOONG on this item, and even with my highest heels, I still had to do a bit of temporary microsurgery on this item so I wouldnt trip and fall on my face.","The snap in front is a bit delicate, so its pretty easy to catch and have everything fly open; I wore a nude strapless bra just for extra precaution.","Im contemplating buying this and getting it properly hemmed b/c it is just such a fun, fancy piece for summer."
"other","This was my first rental.","I ordered a M but the L backup size was not available.","My waist was not flattering in this dress so I didnt wear it to my event.","I wish I had ordered something else now that had the backup size.","However the overall experience was so easy.","I will be renting again going up a size with the item & definitely getting a backup size."
"other","The color was much more of a vibrant hot pink than the picture led me to believe, but I love the color even more!","All the comments are accurate - it is a very short dress (and Im saying that being only 53), it is not very forgiving in the tummy area because of how low the drop waist is (nothing a little spanx cant fix).","Overall, I had a great experience with RTR and already have my next rental lined up!","Definitely recommend this dress."
"other","Runs a bit small but still really comfortable and easy to move in.","The fabric is really thick so it warm without being stifling.","I ended up fully zipping and then tucking the neck down a bit .","But its still pretty restrictive to any tilting of the head.","Like other reviewers have noted theres major side boob."
"other","The dress is gorgeous.","Runs REALLY small!","I usually wear a 14 in a dress but read the reviews and ordered the 16 and 18... wore the 18 as it runs so small.","It is also pretty low cut.","The lace covers you up a bit but I was really conscious of how much cleavage was showing (Sorry I totally forgot to take a pic!!).","Got tons of compliments on the dress and overall I did feel great!","Wore it for my rehearsal dinner for my wedding."
"other","I needed a white top for family photos and it turned out great.","I have also worn it to work but may show too much skin for some work places, I did wear a jacket over it and even though the sleeves are a little poofy at the ends it looked fine under the jacket.","I would definitely consider buying"
"other","I ended up not wearing this dress, though I had rented it for Easter Sunday because of the spring colors.","The fabric felt expensive and the cut was flattering (yay wrap dresses!).","The pink appears much richer in person and the flowers are a little bigger than I personally prefer in a dress.","I think this dress could be great but I just didnt love it."
"other","Such a comfortable and fun dress I decided to make it work vs sending it back.","I added a sheer black blouse and a lace half-camisole to offset the plunging neckline issue.","-- Mega-stretchy so it will both show what ya got and adapt to various body types.","Thick material good for smoothing over things.","-- Id size down for backup, though broader shoulders or larger bust might fill out top ok-- DEEP plunge to bottom of bra band on me ( Im short-waisted so also had a little extra fabric in back)-- Longer in the back on 54 me than is ideal for flattery (hit mid-calf), but curving high-low hem makes this a special dress so I left it alone"
"other","This is the perfect for a birthday or bachelorette party!","I am typically between a size 4 and 6 and wouldve liked to try the size 6 to get more of a shift look.","There is comfortable room throughout so it would work great for any body type.","Since there is a low open back I would suggest going braless or wearing a nubra!"
"other","Love this dress: forgiving fabric with an interesting wave texture and I think a subtle gold thread running through it that makes it look special.","Im curvy and this dress laid very nicely.","Im planning to wear it to a work dinner and also a memorial."
"other","I tried this dress on at the NYC Henri Bendel showroom after my stylist handed it to me to try on.","I probably wouldnt have picked it out but I loved it!","Very flattering, and beautiful brocade fabric.","Since it was March, I paired it with leggings, boots, and a leather jacket for warmth and also to dress it down for the film screening I attended.","Id love to rent this dress again.","Update: I reviewed this dress months after I wore it.","I assumed I wore the 6, as usual.","But I never even rented a 6.","The size 4 fit great in the showroom and I took it with me."
"other","In my recent memory I havent had a dress that is this comfortable and this flattering!","With pockets no less!","I wore this dress to my engagement photos and it was picture perfect!","I measure 42 in the waist and 38 in the chest and the size 12 fit wonderfully.","Would love to rent again, but there are too many other dresses to explore!"
"other","Great for photos, especially if you are able to catch the wind.","Added a belt to highlight the waist.","Felt amazing in this gown.","Pros- the RED stands out and is great for pictures - it s generally flattering dress Cons (if I had to list) - the dress was 2 inches long for me.","I am 54 wearing 4 inch heels- the v neck was extremely low.","I had to pin it up and its still pretty low- the slit could be a bit higher so it shows a bit more leg SuggestionsOrder a second size smaller than your standard.","This dress fits large."
"other","I wore this to an auction my friend chaired.","It was simple and classic.","Fit great!","Could have sized down but the arms and chest would have been slightly uncomfortable.","Pockets would have sent this dress over the top.","A perfect and professional LBD."
"other","UNBELIEVABLE the photos do not do this dress justice.","Within 3 minuets of walking out of my hotel room I received a complement.","People continued to stop me all night long and ask me where I bought my dress.","I wore the 8 and I believe the 6 would have fit better, but it was still a SHOWSTOPPER.","I plan to rent this again for an upcoming trip to Vegas.","LOVE LOVE LOVED it!"
"other","Thoughts: I ordered both the 6 and the 8 (I float between sizes depending on the cut of a dress) and ended up wearing the 6.","As other reviewers mentioned, it is cut a bit on the shorter end.","Great if you arent hesitant to show some leg; not great if that isnt your thing.","The structured waist and lace cutouts gave me a great shape.","No bra needed.","I didnt have any issue with the lace overlay falling flat.","Would wear again!"
"other","I did get compliments but this dress wasnt a showstopper.","(They cant all be!)","Having said that, I dont regret renting this dress.","One nice thing is that this dress could serve a few purposes based on the size.","The dress did fit true to size but could also be more casual and flowy if you  order one size up.","If you want something super fitted and dramatic, order a size down.","This would be a great office holiday party dress but maybe not a sexy number for a Vegas night out."
"other","I rented this dress for my engagement photo session, and i loved it.","We didnt end up taking a lot of photos while wearing this dress but I would rent it again!","My only issue with the dress was that it was WAY too big on top so i had to use a lot of fashion tape to keep it up."
"other","I wore this for a latin dance event.","It was tight as I ordered a 4 when I should have stayed with the 6.","It zips up the side which is great and I wore a strapless bra with it.","There is a clasp that is snug and makes is so that you may be able to wear without a bra.","The flowy nature of the material and style made this a fun dress to wear.","Color was great too."
"other","Obsessed with this top!","So cute and fun.","I loved the detail and style of the top - especially the sleeves.","It runs true to size.","I would recommend going one size up for backup.","The fabric has no stretch but there is comfortable room throughout the midsection.","It’s straight at the waist.","Great for any cup size and should be worn with a strapless bra because of the lace.","Can make it dressy or casual.","Great for work or meeting up with friends, day or night.","Would definitely rent again!"
"other","The fabric has a beautiful sheen and interesting colors and pattern.","The right accessories really helped it pop.","I am usually between a size 2 and a size 4 and definitely needed a size 4 in this dress as it has no stretch or give to the material."
"other","This jacket fits snug, so you cant wear anything bulky underneath.","I paired it with a short black dress and a multi-strand pearl necklace for a fashion show fundraiser.","Didnt get as many compliments as I usually do with RTR items.","Maybe its better with a more casual look?"
"other","Definitely not for the small chested girls.","Which was precisely why I chose it and it was perfect.","I wore it with a velvet choker to soften the leather look and a side sweep faux hawk.","It was pretty jaw dropping."
"other","The dress runs small and because it had been cleaned several times, the outer layer had shrunk smaller than the lining so it was hanging down about 1.5 inches below the dress.","I called customer service and they were fantastic.","Apologized for the issue, adjusted the price, and suggested I use hem tape to fix.","I didnt think they would want me to alter the dress in any way and was really anticipating Id need to scramble to find something different.","I give their service an A+!"
"other","I really liked this white printed crepe jacquard.","Im usually a size 4 wearing a small, running true to size we recommend sizing up for back up if youre curvier and sizing down if youre smaller framed.","The bust area has stretch and ample room, allowing a fit for all cup sizes.","It is a fitted dress throughout the midsection with a very stretchy fabric.","At 56 hit me at mid thigh length.","I absolutely love the little slit on the side but for someone with an hourglass figure it was difficult to keep the dress from rising up.","With long sleeves and a crew neckline, this piece may be worn with a standard bra.","Great for a night out!"
"other","You can never go wrong with a jumpsuit & this one was perfect for a night out with a few of my friends!","Its stretchy which makes it comfy, the cutouts make it sexy without being too over the top and its just fun!","You can dress it up or down, wear heels or flats...your options are endless!","I will definitely be renting this in the white version also."
"other","The colors are much brighter in person.","I thought it was going to be more pastel.","With that said, I loved the dress.","I got a lot of compliments and really enjoyed the day.","(I wore the dress for my law school graduation).","The dress is of a modest length above the knee and the neck like was perfect.","It is made of good material and is thicker than I was imagining but I liked that because it didnt feel cheap.","All in all I love the dress and would consider purchasing it to keep!"
"other","I attended a prohibition-themed party in an old barn in Central California and I couldnt help but get this dress for it (even though there were other options more to theme).","I got SO many compliments that evening - it really made it unforgettable!","The neck line is out of my comfort zone so that was fun.","If you have any sort of boobies (I wear a b cup) it will reveal more skin than the model photo shows.","But I didnt mind - just wish I had a different bra to wear as I found myself revealing a bit too much (probably should have used some tape).","Fit: Im 55 so the length was perfect with some 4 heels.","It was snug around my ribs (mine are a bit large for my size) but not too tight and my booty fit right in there.","I want to say its true to size but I wore the 6L and Im usually an 8 - made me feel better anyways :)Wish I could wear this dress every day with all the compliments I got!"
"other","I rented this dress for my 8th grade promotion (graduation ceremony) and dance.","It fit me very well, it was really crisp, and the colors were much more vibrant than in the online picture.","The fabric was nice and thick, and even though I wore it on a hot summer night I wasnt too hot.","The zipper was very frustrating, though.","The zipper on the size 0 would not go up, but the 2 looked the same in regards to the rest of the dress, but the zipper went up much easier.","The pockets were very nice to hold a lip gloss and my iPhone 4s with an Otterbox case on it.","It seems like it would also be able to hold a phone an inch or so bigger than that.","Overall, the dress was beautiful and it was a great rental!"
"party","The dress was very flattering.","The material is thick and high quality.","The pattern on the design was unique enough to be fun for a party or nice dinner, but not too loud so you could really wear it for a variety of occassions."
"party","The dress was beautiful but if I had bought it rather than rented it I would have taken it in.","I would normally wear a size 10 but the bust was a BIT snug so had to go with the 12.","Although it was a little loose fitting for this reason, it also made it comfortable and I received many compliments on it!","Overall size was true to fit and I would recommend it."
"party","I wore this dress for a great gatsby themed wedding party.","It worked well as I wasnt sure about how into the theme others would be getting and the dress wasnt overly costume-y, but still fit the bill perfectly (with an added accessory or two).","The dress is definitely attention-getter--would probably also work well for New Years!"
"party","I rented this dress and a backup, but I didnt end up wearing it.","Im a 4 to a 6 in most clothes - rented a 6 and could not zip it up.","My rib cage is too wide - I would have needed an 8.","Pretty dress.","I did not have the tight sleeve issue others wrote about.","Loved the pockets."
"party","It has an overall great fit.","I wore the MR and it was a great length for my height.","It is an A line style so it is flattering for all the hourglass ladies!","You can accessorize this dress with any color.","I wore silver sparkly shoes and a hot pink clutch and it was perfect.","This dress has pockets which is a huge plus!","I wore it for my jobs gala and it was so appropriate but you still feel sexy.","I hope to rent this dress again."
"party","Pros:  I loved pretty much everything about this dress.","The true waist and the gathers at the side made it very flattering.","I was afraid the pink hues might be wrong for a Christmas party, but it worked really well.","The embroidery is quite formal, but I found that the work, against a black background, was quite sharp and modern, not old-fashioned.","The see-through fabric and sweetheart-type neckline were so pretty, and I found the dress to be quite comfortable.","Cons:  The only con was that the bra situation was a little tough.","Im not built to go braless, so I wore strapless.","It was mostly fine -- just had to adjust a few times during the night when it became visible.","Size:  You should order at the lower end of normal for you, or even a size smaller.","I am smaller on top -- usually a small top and a 10/12 pants, and I wore a size 4 in this dress.","The skirt was not tight for my traditional pear-shape...!","!"
"party","I love the idea of this dress, it came as a replacement when the Nha Khanh Sabrina Tulle dress wasnt available.","Though they are similar in design and cut, the white lace overlay on this dress made a poor choice for a NYE cocktail party.","I opted to go with another RTR option instead."
"party","I wore this dress to my sisters bridal shower and it was perfect!","It fits more like a sleeveless dress than is pictured on the model.","The snap closure on the chest cinches the opening together, but I could have really secured things with a safety pin.","Im 59 and the dress came to my ankles...I wore neutral colored, flat sandals.","It was comfortable and really flattering...the perfect dress to wear as MOH without upstaging the bride at her own shower!","I will absolutely rent this one again!"
"party","The dress was awesome!","It was slightly large in the chest area for an A cup; however, its so low cut that with a larger chest you might bust out of it a little bit.","I wish the dress had been a tad shorter (Im 52) but on someone a little taller it would be just the right length for a night out."
"party","I wish I had a photo of myself in this dress because it was about the prettiest Ive ever felt.","For women with big hips and thighs, it conceals everything.","Absolutely stunning.","I didnt want the evening to end."
"party","Its a little big in the chest compared to the photo.","I couldnt get a smaller size in time for my event, so I decided to put a belt on with it.","People stopped me everywhere to compliment the dress!","Its very comfortable although it little warm.","I sweated more than usual in it.","Also tall ladies beware: Its pretty short in the back!"
"party","I absolutely loved this dress!","I wore it to fancy Christmas party held at a country club.","I got tons of compliments.","It fit like a glove.","The only thing that was disappointing regarding the dress I received is that the left seam at the bottom puckered out.","It was not very noticeable, but I could tell.","Also, the sequins caught on everything, but that was a minimal price for looking awesome.","For my height (6) the skirt hit above mid thigh.","I wore opaque, black tights so that made me feel a bit more comfortable with it being so short on me."
"party","It was so comfortable and sparkly.","I wore it to the Grammys and felt like I was dressed like any of the celebrities.","I got tons of compliments.","Had to use the tape to make sure the bust material didnt gap but RTR included some so it wasnt an issue."
"party","I wore this for my friends bachelorette party on Halloween where she dressed as an angel and we were all devils.","The dress was a great fit and perfect for the occasion.","The only thing that stopped this from being a 5 star dress for me was the fit up top.","Im very small-chested and it was a little big and I was self conscious at first about the back straps being a little loose.","The bright side of this was that I didnt need a bra for the dress.","It was short as well (and Im only 52) but that worked fine for my event.","BTW - my friend in the picture is also wearing a RTR dress that worked perfectly for the party as well :)"
"party","I loved the fit and the color of this dress!","I felt pretty and comfortable, and it was easy to dance in!","The fit was true to size, with the exception of the straps which were too long and would have set the dress under my breasts if Id kept them that way.","Instead, I clipped the straps around my neck and it actually made the dress look even better in my opinion.","Id definitely recommend this dress for a party or formal affair!"
"party","I joke to my friends that my criteria for a dress are flaunt the boobs, hide the hips and this dress fit the bill :) It was extremely flattering and very comfortable (with the exception of a little rub under the armpits, which I noticed mentioned in some other reviews too).","It hugged through the waist giving me a really flattering silhouette that was not tight or uncomfortable, and the skirt was wide enough to be comfy and flattering without being too poofy.","It was also a great length for me -- Im just under 54.","There was a tiny gape around the armholes / at the upper back of my shoulders but if it had been any tighter around the arms I think it would have been uncomfortable.","For my bust size at least, it could be cleavage-bearing or more conservative depending on how much of a push-up bra I wore.","I was initially going to wear this for our law school prom with black strappy sandals, but I wound up wearing it for graduation with nude peep-toe wedges instead.","Both shoes looked good.","Ive posted pictures of both (the former also shows the earrings I rented, the Slate & Willow Adam earrings, which I didnt end up wearing for graduation).","The 2 fit great but I tried on the 4 for the heck of it and found that it was a very similar fit through the torso and the only noticeable difference was more space in the upper back / shoulder / armhole area.","I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"party","This dress is beyond wonderful!","I was so nervous about the size because Im normally a petite 4/6 and I had to order the small, but it fit great!","The arms were just a teeny bit tight when I first put it on, but it wasnt uncomfortable at all.","Also, the dress has build in spanx (essentially) so it will look amazing on anyone.","I wish I could order this in every color!","!"
"party","I wore this dress for my law school graduation and the party afterwards.","I loved the sleeves and the lace.","I was a little concerned that the sleeves would be too tight because I have larger arms but it fit perfect.","I agree with the other reviewers that the blue is more royal that in the picture but that made me like the dress more."
"party","I wore this dress to a spaceship/futuristic themed party.","This dress was a total showstopper.","I had everyone coming to look at it.","As you can see from the pics, I am curvy and the dress looked great and it was comfortable.","Other reviewers complaint about the sequins locking on each other but I really didnt experience that.","TIPS: This dress has no zipper so I strongly recommend you put it on before you get your hair done.","Other than that, Ill say it runs true to size."
"party","This dress is absolutely gorgeous!!!","Much prettier in person than in pictures.","The material is thick but not too heavy.","It was a little small especially in the chest which is why I opted for the 8 instead of the 6.","It was very comfortable.","I also didnt think it was too short either.","I got compliments all day!"
"party","The dress is beautiful, fun, lightweight, but as others suggested the straps were too long.","I ordered an 8 and a 10 (I usually wear an 8 in a dress) and the straps and bust on the 8 were way too big.","Im a 34D and the straps were 4 inches too long.","There was a possibility to fold them under and pin and it just look like the straps were tabbed, but the bust was still too big.","A 6 maybe wouldve worked for the bust and hips, but the straps wouldve still been too long.","It arrived on my cocktail party day, so unfortunately, I could not try another dress or another size and went with a dress I had purchased."
"party","I wore this dress to a Christmas party and got so many compliments all night.","It was very comfortable and I felt so glamorous.","It has a very 1930s feel to it.","The sequins under the arms were a little itchy, but I have very sensitive skin and it wasnt bad at all.","After a little bit, I forgot all about it.","I ordered the 6 and the 8 and wore the 8.","It fit a little better on the bottom.","The top fit the same in both.","Im 56, 155 lbs and pear shaped.","The material of this dress is quite stretchy making it very easy to move it.","The length of the skirt was perfect for me.","It his just at the top of my knees.","The top was very flattering to my small chest (34A).","I wore a strapless/backless adhesive bra just for some padding and coverage.","My only con on this dress is the folds that make the back so pretty stick out a bit on the sides, accentuating the hips (an area which I dont need to accentuate).","But I think I was the only person to notice this.","I got compliments all night.","I would definitely order this dress again, maybe in another color next time just for fun.","I loved the green for Christmas!"
"party","This dress is just amazing.","I had a once in a life time opportunity to attend the Grammys and wore this to the festivities.","I cant tell you how many compliments I got - everyone I met was commenting on this dress.","It looks great, feels great and fits great!","I cant recommend it enough.","I will keep this on my short list to wear again!!","!"
"party","I wore this dress for the nieces first birthday party.","It was perfect for a mild summer day, was the perfect length for a family gathering, and the colors were perfectly soft and subtle, yet bright and beautiful for a low-key event.","I got many compliments, even from strangers in the street.","I never felt like the lace was too delicate or was going to catch on things.","If I rented this again, Id make sure to wear it with a nude strapless bra, as my black strapless kept slipping down and showing in the bare midsection.","It was slightly tight in my shoulders and started to chafe my arms after wearing it all day, but it was so beautiful I would endure that again.","My boyfriend, who rarely comments on my clothing, said he wishes I could keep this dress because he liked it so much!"
"party","I have a small bust so this dress was perfect for me but for anyone who has a larger chest it might fit tight around the top.","The stomach part was a bit looser then i had wanted it to be, so i put a yellow belt around it which gave it a bit more color.","All in all it was a nice dress to wear to this birthday party.","Wasnt to much just perfect!"
"party","I have a toddler wearing dresses and having to always bend over and move around can be challenging, this romper was perfect way of wearing something pretty and feminine while still remaining comfortable and easy to move around in."
"party","Wore this to a weekend bachelorette which required one night of neon clothes.","It wasnt the most neon thing in the group, but it did the trick.","Was a cute romper, loved the cutouts, but a little bunchy in the fupa area.","Still would wear it again."
"party","I wore to my work holiday party with jeans and got SO MANY compliments!","Great quality: sequins are secure, material is thick and cozy for cooler weather, not scratchy like other sequin garments.","Couple of things to consider: I have a large chest and small waist, and there are some design features that work against you (loose pockets that add volume right under the chest, elastic gather in the back gives comfort and movement but again adds volume).","The saving grace of this volume is the crop!","Other thing to consider is what to wear under.","I tried about a dozen different tops, and Id recommend something scoop front and silky looking.","I tried dressing down with a cotton T, and it looked very off!"
"party","I rented this dress for New Years Eve--our evening consisted of curry, a hip bar, and a performance by our local symphony!","I felt like this dress was perfect for all three events.","The top fits a little snug, so I wore the Large even though the Medium fit everywhere else.","I got so many compliments on my dress throughout the night--even from strangers!","It was super comfy and paired well with tights and some gold Lotta clogs.","This is definitely one of my favorite rentals of all-time (and I dont say that lightly!",")."
party","The length probably would have been a little inappropriate if I were any taller?","(see photos) I dont know though--- I rented this dress to wear to a fun/sexy event with a crowd of young professionals---it has a classy high neckline + a capped sleeve, which help balance out the length, so my friends totally approved and told me to rock it~~"
"party","I wore this for my bachelorette party.","I got compliments on it all night long, and it fit perfectly.","My only complaint is with the zipper on this dress in this size (I had the 8 as a backup and the zipper worked perfectly on that one).","The zipper on the 10 kept getting stuck, even on the hanger.","It took all of my friends to get the zipper all the way up on me, and that was only after struggling with it on the hanger and then having them help me slip it over my head while zipped up.","Once on, it fit like a glove and stayed put all night long."
"party","This was a fantastic dress.","It fit beautifully.","I wanted something for a formal Sunday brunch, and this worked perfectly.","I am a solid size 8 (sometimes a 6) and the 42 fit perfectly.","Im 57 and wore 3 inch heels and sometimes the dress was slightly on the ground.","I would rent this again in a heartbeat.","My only small compliant is that the underslip is tight and short.","I ended up putting a longer white slip underneath and that solved the problem.","You can tell, however, this is an expensive dress, and it is extremely flattering."
"party","This dress had so many good reviews I was excited to wear it.","I normally wear a ten but that was way too big and the eight was a little large as well.","I ended up pinning the top of it since Im not well endowed enough to fill it out.","If I rent it again Id definitely order a six.","I liked how the skirt fell as it hid any trouble spots, but was really glad I paired it with really high heels since the skirt fell longer on me due to my height.","I did receive a lot of compliments on it and some from people I didnt even know at the semi-formal party."
"party","I am 5’5” and had to wear 3-4” heels in order for the dress not to pool on the ground.","It was still such a beautiful dress and I had so much fun wearing it.","The built in bra was also very convenient.","Great dress to wear in the winter months too!"
"party","This dress was perfect for my company Holiday Party.","I received so many compliments and the fit was great.","Definitely true to size.","The skirt was full but it was cold so it added some extra warmth.","Loved it!"
"party","This dress fit true to size for the most part.","I have pretty wide shoulders and had a little difficulty getting the sleeves in place, but once I did was good for the night.","I also have very long arms and the length of the sleeve was perfect.","Some may find them long.","Also, a little more low cut than it looks in the picture.","Especially if large on top."
"party","I loved this outfit!","Very stylish, chic and not to thin to wear during cooler seasons.","The only downside is I wasnt able to wear it because my obliques are my trouble spot.","If you are bloated, your belly may pool out in an unflattering way wearing this outfit.","I wish I was able to wear it and may rent it again after a cleanse rather than after gorging on salty food.","Also, invest in a nice backless bra for this outfit, it is white after all."
"party","I loved the color and fit of this dress!","While it was a bit tight in the rib cage the overall fit was very flattering and comfortable.","I wore this for a work holiday party and received a lot of compliments.","The color of the dress was a beautiful warm green that you cant capture in a picture."
"party","The medium worked also but was a a little short on me.","I am large chested and did not need a bra so dont worry if you are concerned about the lace back.","The bottom rides up a little as you walk but not a big deal.","Overall, Id rent again!"
"party","Ive rented at RTR for years now -- and this is possibly my favorite dress!","Wow!","Both the small and the medium fit well.","I went with the medium so I could be more comfortable during dinner.","The lace is such high quality; its soft to the touch, and the eyelash fringe is perfectly delicate.","The red is gorgeous.","I am pretty choosy about red since I am prone to blemishes.","This red is just the right color.","I wore this to a work dinner and then directly to a party at a bar.","With just a few accessory changes in the cab, it was a hit at both parties.","I was nervous about the see-through portions of the dress for the formal work dinner.","Because the lace was so well done, it was not tacky at all.","Also, the high neck, cap sleeves, and knee length helped with the modesty factor.","I received tons of compliments and did not feel inappropriate.","I felt fantastic!","Then  at the party at the bar it was a standout dress.","Most of the other dresses were sequined or body-con style.","This lovely lace number felt classy and the bold red made it sassy."
"party","I rented the size 8 and size 10.","The 8 fit well, except in the bust.","I wear a 34D and I had to put on 2 strapless bras, as well as stuff with 1 sock each, to get the dress to stay up comfortably.","Probably shouldve gone with the 6 in hindsight.","The dress is really beautiful and the color is fabulous.","It worked out perfectly for the gothic glamour fundraiser I attended."
"party","Most rompers/jumpsuits are difficult to get on/off and this was surprisingly easy.","Perfect size 8, maybe on the larger side.","Im 5.11, 150, and 34D, definitely fit my hippy figure.","I word a strapless bra with this and felt like I could do anything in this outfit.","Well tailored, lined, looks great even after partying until dawn."
"party","This dress fit perfectly and was so comfortable!","Its really stretchy and light-perfect for a summer wedding or party.","I got so many compliments!","I am usually a 6 so I ordered the 6 and an 8 and the 6 was perfect."
"party","When I showed up in this dress, my best friend said, I am so borrowing this from you.","I told her, sorry its going back tomorrow but I am DEFINITELY renting it again!","This is a fun dress that is figure flattering and I got the compliments all afternoon to prove it.","I wore hot pink shoes for a bit of color and it matched the lace at the bottom of the dress as it has a pink undertone to it.","I would not recommend wearing this dress in the summer as the fabric is heavy."
"party","I loved everything about my first rental experience with Rent the Runway.","The lace of first dress they sent was in bad shape so I informed customer service and they overnighted the same dress at no additional charge.","The necklace was also rented, it is Slate & Willows Take the Throne necklace."
"party","This was the perfect dress for a holiday party where I wasnt really sure what the attire would be...its the perfect up-down dress.","very stretchy soft fabric, flattering, probably could be worn by pregnant women."
"party","I got a 2 and a 4.","The zipper is not very smooth, so even with a little pull on a tight fitting dress it would not zip up.","The size 4 worked perfectly.","It gives a nice silhouette with the shoulder pads.","The base material of the dress is like a sweatshirt (heather gray) the black swirl is beautiful on a mesh backing.","Great fun party dress."
"party","Typically wear a 14/16.","XL was a great fit.","Dress fits well and hugs and hides all the right curves.","Sleeves were a little snug but after moving around a bit, I hardly noticed.","The split is a little low for a short person which made it a challenge getting in and out of the car.","Had to hike it up to keep from ripping it."
"party","I rented this dress as a larger size backup but as soon as I tried it on, I knew it was the dress I would be wearing for my event!","I usually wear a size 8 but the 10 fit perfectly.","I have a larger bust (36DD) so the bigger size was perfect for me, If you are less busty, I would imagine your usual size would fit perfectly.","The fabric is very lux with a really stunning shine and the color is to die for!","This is a dress I really wish I could have kept!"
"party","This dress is absolutely stunning!","Fits true to size and is very flattering.","The arms were a little baggy but the detailing is so beautiful that it didnt really matter.","There isnt any stretch to the dress but it was still comfortable and form fitting in the best way possible.","I would highly recommend this dress for any special occasion!"
"vacation","I love shift dresses, and this one was beautiful!!!","The fabric was perfect and it could be dressed up or down with flats or heels !","I wore this dress for a night out on the town in Miami, FL and it was perfect!","I would highly recommend this dress and I wish I could buy it!","Another RTR success!!","!"
"vacation","Im usually a 4 in dresses and the small fits perfectly.","The dress has a bit of weight to it and the yellow color is nice and bright.","The lacing is very detailed but wont snag easily.","The drop shoulders kept riding up though when I sat down to eat.","Thankfully I had a black cape sweater on so I didnt have to keep pulling the shoulders down.","This is the first time I wore this type of dress so Im not sure if its common for the shoulders to ride up or I just need to size up.","Maybe Ill try the medium next time!"
"vacation","I wore this while in Vegas on a friendversary trip with my best friend.","I freaking LOVED this dress.","The only thing I wasnt super crazy about was that it felt like the sleeve was trying to slip off my shoulder.","Not a big deal.","There isnt much stretch in the dress at all.","And its pretty short if youre on the tall side.","If you dont want to overexpose yourself just get a pair of boyshorts or Spanx to wear underneath."
"vacation","Wore this on a trip to Vegas and it was comfortable and sexy without having to let it all hangout.","I wore a regular bra with thin straps.","It was very comfortable and lightweight.","I would rent again.","It is very long.","Im 59 and it hit my ankles so would not recommend for shorter people unless you wear with tall heels."
"vacation","I love this jacket.","The leather is soft and the pockets have fleece inside which feels great on a cold night.","I rented a Medium but would probably size up to a large so I could wear a bulkier sweater underneath.","The one drawback is that when zipped up the waist was tight on me, its sort of a triangle silhouette, which is flattering but impractical depending on your weight and outfit.","Wearing the jacket out I honestly felt I got better service than I normally would - either this jacket says treat me well or I was acting more confident in it.","I was trying it out to see if Id actually wear a black leather jacket and the answer is YES!"
"vacation","im typically btwn a 2 and a 4, but always a 2 in rebecca taylor.","this was extremely unflattering on me.","i didnt find the neck to the tight.","it was just massive.","even if i got the 0 i think it wldnt have worked.","ive worn other dresses in this tent-ish style and never had a problem, but this did not work for me.","it made me look short and very pregnant.","it is ok with a belt, but that isnt the look im going over."
"vacation","This dress doesnt mess around.","It looks sexy and has that, I am a strong woman!","look.","Bold and beautiful and classy all at the same time.","I didnt end up wearing it though, because another dress I recieved was the better choice for the look I was going for."
"vacation","I love the way the romper looked.","It was perfect for going to a Britney Spears concert in Las Vegas.","I got lots of compliments.","However, I wouldnt wear it again because it made me too nervous that I might have a wardrobe malfunction--I kept having to check that everything was in place.","Double sided tape is a must but even then, its very little material to cover the girls.","Im pear-shaped and it was hard to squeeze it over my hips too."
"vacation","Fit as expected in the waist but a little large in the top.","Its a unique, large and bright floral pattern  - perfect for renting b/c its very in now but its a pretty loud print that Im not sure will still be in next season."
"vacation","Loved the fit - wore the XS vs. the S I thought Id wear.","I have larger hips for my height/chest size but it still fit fine.","Didnt stretch out like other reviews stated, but I wasnt moving around a whole lot.","I wore stick petals vs. a real or strapless bra and that worked well for my small chest.","Im 53 and it was mid-thigh.","I loved it and got a TON of compliments!"
"vacation","The weight of the dress and the lining are very nice!","It is a fun, figure fitting dress in a quality stretchy fabric that was very comfortable to wear!","With the detail of the dress, I opted for nude shoes, big earrings and a clutch to match."
"vacation","It was very short in the torso on me.","I kept getting a wedgie...but the piece is super cute so I wore it anyway!","It didnt come with a belt so I used my own.","I wish it came in a long and it would have been perfect.","I could have worn a size 0 but I figured the 2 might be a little longer.","Still wasnt long enough, probably should have just gone with the 0 as the 2 was just a little big in the waist."
"vacation","Very short.","I am 53 and I wouldnt have been able to wear heels.","I am pretty small chested and if I took a big breath or stretched my arms, the button closure would pop.","Adjustable straps helped.","I felt cute and flirty in it.","I would def rent again for vacation, day party, baby shower etc."
"vacation","I rented this for a weekend trip to Traverse City.","It was snowy there, so this was the perfect layering sweater.","I wore it with a cute gray tee underneath, and then I wore it again with a flannel underneath.","Its the perfect sweater to keep you warm in the cold winter months!","My boyfriend loved it!","I will definitely rent again."
"vacation","The chest area was UNFORGIVING.","Im a 38D and they only way I got it on was by zipping it up around my waist and then stuffing my boobs into it ( a trick i learned from the reviews, thanks girls).","It was tight, and I felt that if I moved too quickly I might tear the damn thing but in the end totally worth it because the dress is gorgeous.","Just wish they would make clothes with bustier girls in mind."
"vacation","I rented this for vacation in Charleston, SC.","I had my eye on this dress for a while and was really happy with the rental.","I would have prefered a size 0 but only the 2R was available.","It was larger than I would have prefered, but would definitely rent the 0R again.","Im 53 and wore this with flats, didnt think the length was awkward at all.","Paired with a big sun hat I loved strolling the streets of low country in the dress.","I recommend it!"
"vacation","I found the medium didnt fit in the waist as it was too tight so I had to size up to Large which made the top too large.","The lower shoulder was way too low to be appropriate so I had to keep pulling it up.","It wasnt a quality issue and the romper was well made.","Just not for someone whos 51."
"vacation","This dress fit perfect!","The inside is a supersoft material that was a little stretchy.","I might have been able to go down to an 8.","I was comfortable all night in this dress, if I had a reason to dress like this more often I would buy it!","It was not short at all.","If someone was shorter than me the length might be too long for them."
"vacation","I thought this was black when I ordered it, its definitely more of a brown or brown black.","The rise is also short; I didnt really have enough fabric above the waist to create a blousy effect like on the model (it would have involved giving myself a wedgie!)","Overall a success!"
"vacation","Im a little too short for the torso of this one piece, but I still wore it for a brunch date and got compliments!","Its very comfortable, light-weight and not at all sheer because of the liner.","I could have considered buying this one if I were over 53 and it fit me!","Easy to dress up or dress down - definitely worth the rent for your vacation or just to have a weekend option in your closet!"
"vacation","This dress isnt made of Clover Canyons usual material - this is more of a jersey material.","But the dress fits well and the pattern is fun.","The cutout is just enough.","Its definitely long.","I am only 52 , but with the regular length I needed 5 heels for the dress not to drag."
"vacation","Moves really well, photographs well.","All that is at the waist is a string tie, which I used but if you want something more substantial you might have to add a belt.","Length was fine with heels because it was supposed to be flowy and fun, might have been too long with flats."
"vacation","Loved this dress a lot unfortunately it did not arrive before i left for my vacation.","Its a little short for my office so I had to send it back but I look forward to renting it again for the right occasion.","Maybe a shower or luncheon or brunch or graduation."
"vacation","Ive worn other sequence dresses but this one was unlike the others, comfortable around the underarm area.","usually the sequences rub against my skin and hurt at the end of the night but not these.","the color is very flattering like a golden pinkish, wore it with golden/glittery/crystal stilettos, a gold bangle and gold hoops, no necklace.","looks great on pictures and is a head turner for sure.","My husband said it is a very pretty dress and that I looked elegant.","So if your thing is to show your curves, this is not the dress."
"vacation","This dress is true to fit.","Based on photos, I thought it was a true fit & flare style dress but there is a ruffle at the hem of the dress that gives the dress more curve to your shape.","The halter shape was a bit big on me -- might be better for a larger bust -- but was fine with some fashion tape.","Overall, loved the dress!"
"vacation","At first I was worried the dress wouldnt zip so I called RTR for help.","They were great!","Since I was in Vegas they offered to exchange the dress at their Cosmopolitan store.","Luckily with a little tug.","the dress was a perfect fit.","Hig hugging and very slimming.","Another success from RTR!"
"vacation","Wore with a standard strapless bra.","If I rent again, I will go down one size.","The straps were a little bit long, and so my hubby tied little knots at the top of the straps to shorten them.","Luckily my hair hid the knots.","This shirt can be dressed up or down, and I felt really great in it.","I wore it over 4th of July weekend, and the red, white and blue colors were great....but, Id wear it anytime."
"vacation","I am short, but I felt tall and glamorous in this dress.","I did wear nearly 4 platform sandals and it hit the floor, so dont expect to wear this with flats unless you are nearly 58!","I have a narrow shoulders, a large bust, small waist and large hips, and find long dresses hard to fit--but this worked so well.","I got a lot of compliments!"
"vacation","I am a six weeks post partum gal with 34-F bra size due to breast feeding.","I know my current body is temporary and needed a bright dress for my family vacation photos.","This dress was very forgiving on my body and managed to fit my large breast size perfectly.","It is very orange and the color was originally a smidge off putting, but boy does it photograph well!","Highly recommend for larger cup sized ladies."
"vacation","I rented at his for work because in the photo it looked like a crisp cut and fabric.","It was softer in fabric and cut than expected and not formal enough for my office so I wore it on vacation and for plane travel.","Very comfortable, classic cut fits comfortably and feels soft.","Fit is true to size and fairly generous."
"vacation","I rented this to wear for New Years Eve at the beachy resort in Florida.","The color is beautiful, I would call it persimmon -- it is a tad more orange than in the photo.","The fit was amazing for my shape.","The v in the front was the perfect depth, not too conservative but definitely not too low.","The fitted waste with the slightly flared skirt was extremely flattering.","The length was a tab longer on me than the model, I would say an inch above my knee.","I received compliments all night and would absolutely rent again."
"vacation","This sweater was a little bigger than I expected and I could have probably gotten away with a Medium.","I wore this on the first day of my trip to San Francisco from the plane, to walking around the city.","It was about 55 degrees and I wasnt hot at all.","It was the perfect weight without having to wear a jacket.","My only complaint is that it was already somewhat bigger than expected and then stretched a little.","Certainly comfortable, but I dont think I will rent it again."
"vacation","Dress seemed to be true to size, but due to the cut/style of it, I am unable to wear it.","It is a little boxy and has too much room in the chest and not enough room in the hips.","This would be cute for someone with less hips than myself."
"vacation","This dress was so cute for a day spent on Bourbon Street and at the parades.","I liked how low cut it was.","It was very fitted until the waist and I didnt even need to wear a bra.","It hit right at my waist and flared from there, and it was very flattering and slimming.","It also wasnt too short - it hit right above the knee.","This can be dressed up to be really fancy or dressed down to be more of a fun/party dress.","I usually am between a 2 and a 4 and went with the 2.","I would describe the color as a rose gold.","I would SO rent this again!"
"vacation","Absolutely loved this dress!","The blue is even more vibrant in person, and it s on a heather grey background which is a little hard to tell in the pictures.","I also rented the suggested necklace, and while I was a little skeptical when I saw the necklace separate from the dress, it worked beautifully together.","I wore this for a night out in Vegas in April, and I was a little nervous it would be too warm based on other reviews, but it was perfect."
"vacation","I loved wearing this nice light dress during my recent Hawaii vacation.","It was airy and comfortable.","The bohemian print was perfect for going out to dinner and then coming back to our place and having a casual night hanging with  friends."
"vacation","Love this silky, breezy dress.","Wore it on a trip to Napa Valley with friends.","You could wear it with sandals or booties and it would pair well with tights and a long sweater for Fall.","Its very flowy, so if youre looking for something fitted, plan on wearing a belt."
"vacation","I am having so much fun with the unlimited plan.","I had to go to a screening and wanted a fun top.","I popped into the store near me and I saw this in the dressing room.","I do not normally wear this pattern but I loved the design so I figured I would try it on.","So glad I did!","I am a 36D so it was a bit tight on the boobs but honestly it was fine.","Felt like a corset.","It was much sexier on then you would think.","Would rent it and wear again!","Boyfriend liked it too!"
"vacation","This dress was perfect for dinner on vacation.","It fit in all the right places.","I have a small bust and a very athletic build and it fit perfectly.","The colors of the dress are perfect!","I received compliments all night.","I wish I owned this dress."
"vacation","Wore this in Vegas on my bachelorette trip!","Was perfect for a girly night out (Thunder Down Under & dinner!).","Was very comfortable.","The darker shade of gold is really complementary to skin tones.","The dress is way less tulip-y in person FYI but very pretty!"
"vacation","LOVE every dress Ive rented from Mara Hoffman!","Her prints are magic and her dresses always fit me even though Im short-waisted and short in general.","I loved that this one wasnt too sheer and could be dressed up or down.","I wore it in Hawaii with flip flops but it would look great with wedges or a casual heel.","This one runs pretty big.","I got the small but probably could have gone with the XS."
"vacation","I liked this dress and appreciated that it came in petite.","I am 53 and was able to wear this with flat sandals.","I am usually on the fence between a small and medium (4/6 dress size), but the small fit well.","Fun dress for vacation."
"vacation","I loved this dress but there are some things you should know when choosing a size.","This dress runs small so you may want to size up.","If you are 115 lbs or more, I would recommend a size Small or larger (depending on your body type).","I am a pretty small person and the X-Small was too tight for me.","That size is meant for a very petite body type.","The waist band on this dress is very small/tight and does not have stretch to it so keep this in mind.","The other reviews regarding the slit are spot on - it is VERY high.","You will need fashion tape or safety pins to keep the top closed (and not show the goods).","I used a couple safety pins.","This dress is so cute and I received many compliments.","Just know you need to be careful with the size you choose."
"vacation","I rented this dress for vacation at the beach.","This dress is as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures.","However, I wrote that it ran true to size, and, for the most part, it does, but it was a little loose in the waist.","For that reason, it wasnt as flattering as it could have been.","Other than that, I loved the length (I am 58 and wore the regular length with flats--I probably could have even worn a small heel).","The crocheted top is great for adding a little texture.","The dress is very well made and I felt great wearing it.","Would definitely recommend!"
"vacation","Wore it in Vegas.","Super Cute but you do have to unzip the jumpsuit every time you have to pee, which got annoying by the end of the night.","Its different than the typical short dress outfit for Vegas, yet it was sexy and fun to wear."
"vacation","Fit true to size, and I loved it, but there is a built in corset and the metal boning was coming through the fabric and was quite painful.","I tried covering with band-aids, but it didnt really help.","Otherwise it was a great outfit, and I loved it."
"vacation","An original take on florals for Spring!","This tea length style was so flattering and fun to wear, the pairing of  this bold floral print with the subtle ruffle detailing was so different yet completely approachable.","The fabric on the style is very stretchy and truly comfortable against my skin.","It fit true to size and I would suggest sizing up for a backup size.","It must be worn with a strapless bra or NuBra, there is room in the bust so it is great for any cup size.","There is a tie to cinch the waist in but it is not fitted at all and there is ample room.","Spanx or shape wear are suggested but not necessarily needed, I would recommend this dress for the following body types - Apple, Hourglass, Athletic, Pear, Petite, Straight & Narrow, Full Bust, Bump Friendly.","I would wear this style on vacation to a nicer dinner, on a date in the Spring/Summer, to a wedding or semi formal brunch.","I would pair with simple accessories and not deviate from the colors used within the print (lots to choose from; prink, orange, navy, turquoise)."
"vacation","I have a small waist yet this dress still was pretty darn snug around the band.","I was hoping it would hang a bit looser.","Loved the neckline and loved how flowy the bottom was.","If there was one size higher, Id rent again for a bit looser fit.","I normally dont have a problem with things being too tight around the waist, so that was a bit of a disappointment.","Still photographed great though (also, it should be known that I was in austin eating tacos so maybe thats why its so tight 😂) See more on insta of my unlimited subscription: @iamsarahwebb"
"vacation","I wore these pants on a trip to the Middle East.","I figured they would be both fashionable and airy for the desert sun.","Theyre lined, so they were actually less breathable/airy than I thought.","But it was still a great choice for photos/activities on a day when a dress wasnt appropriate.","Would absolutely recommend!"
"vacation","This dress caught my eye and I rented it just because.","I changed into it at a rest stop on the highway and got complimented on the dress as I exited the stall!","I went a size up from my normal size and was really comfortable all day.","The length fell a few inches above my knee, a little shorter than it looks in my pic, which was perfect for me.","The dress was a little snug just below the bust, and my bust/waist are on the smaller side, so consider sizing up if you need more room in this area."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a wedding; when it arrived I gasped when I saw the color and lace in person!","It is a beautiful, eye-catching dress.","It was just slightly too big for me in the waist area; if it came in a size 0, that probably would have fit me better.","However, I wore it anyway because I loved the teal color and lace details!","Guests were coming up to me all night to ask where I got it.","I was really sad to mail it back!"
"wedding","I love Elizabeth and James esp their sheath dresses.","They are so flattering and comfortable and the fabric and colors are always so high quality.","I love the neckline on this and the color is so BRIGHT!","Such a fun pink for a outdoor San Diego wedding.","Lots of compliments!","I recommend a strapless bra because the arm holes come in a bit."
"wedding","I ordered a 0 and 2 and ended up going with the 2.","Im normally a 0, but for a wedding that size seemed too short/tight and the 2 gave me room to dance/sit/just feel more comfortable.","Its a beautiful dress and makes you feel very sexy and romantic!","I wore the red, which is bright and makes a statement!","I saw someone who was wearing the navy, which is also very pretty."
"wedding","This dress was a huge winner.","It fit perfectly, I have a curvy build and it accentuated in all the right places but was SO comfortable.","The color is way more vibrant in real life, tons of compliments.","The lace coverage was great for the conservation church wedding as well.","Fit completely true to size.","I ordered a size up based on some of the reviews but the 4 was perfect, it actually seemed to stretch out a little over the course of the night."
"wedding","I loved this dress, I thought the 0 was a bit too tight (it felt like I couldnt really move my legs too much or sit down very comfortably), but the 2 fit perfectly.","It was really comfortable, a great length (may be too short on someone taller than me though - Im about 51) and a really fun pattern.","I got a bunch of compliments on the dress and felt really great in it."
"wedding","This dress was great!","The top is cotton and has just enough stretch that you can be comfortable.","Pockets in a dress are always a great feature!","The full skirt can make you look a little hippie so if you have hips this may not be the dress for you.","The two clips were a little tricky to close on your own, I clipped the back on and stepped through it."
"wedding","I really loved wearing this dress...it was fun and looked really great on.","I especially loved the pockets it has.","The down side is that it looks awful in photos if the angle is anything but for the front.","It makes your backside look really huge but other than that it was perfect."
"wedding","I believe other reviews mentioned the hard-to-get-up zipper.","And its true - but as long as youre prepared for that (and careful zipping it up with assistance), theres not a thing wrong with this dress.","Mint color is gorgeous, style is flattering - you will feel like a red-carpet celebrity.","So unique - I LOVED it!"
"wedding","This dress fit like a glove and I got so many compliments all night!","In the picture on the website I NEVER would have picked it, because it looks kind of plain or ill-fitting.","But I went to the store in NY and tried on a lot of dresses, and when I came out in this one my husbands jaw hit the floor.","A gorgeous dress that fit perfectly and made me feel like a movie star.","Also, super comfortable."
"wedding","Slimming dress, stretchy, and so unique and delicate.","The detail is so stunning and you can t really tell in photos.","Both men and women loved this dress.","It is a bit more pink than red but the color was stunning.","I really cant get over the lace on this and it was a perfect dress to dance in as well.","Breathed easy.","Felt great and sophisticated in this and definitely recommend for a fall/winter affair.","Paired with nude pumps and gold jewelry."
"wedding","Snug in the waist, ribs are other reviewers noted.","I have a pretty small ribcage though, so it was still comfortable.","I wear generally a 32A, and this dress + a sticky bra made me look like I had some cleavage!",":) Also, its not just a flower print on the dress - its actually some embroidery.","Just beautiful.","Perfect skirt for twirling on the dance floor...my husband loved that!","I would rent again for sure."
"wedding","Runs on the smaller side in the hips/bottom area, so ended up wearing the 6 instead of 4.","The material is great - very thick with minimal stretch so does not require Spanx or a bra.","Overall was a great dress that I would definitely recommend and rent again!"
"wedding","The fit on the bust/shoulders seemed a little tight, but its better described as snug.","The fabric/material is just stretch enough for comfort, and worked great for lots of dancing.","Very comfortable fit in that sense.","I wore a 2 and Im normally a 2, but it does run a little small.","Id say anyone with more than 34B might find this too tight up top."
"wedding","Loved everything about the fit and structure of this dress.","It sits pretty perfectly on the natural waist line to draw attention there, while being flattering and forgiving to all other areas with the A-line plus I was able to wear a regular bra - always a win!","Im 59 and the underlay hit me a couple of inches above the knee which was perfect when standing though if you are a Spanx-wearer like me, you may have to hike them up a bit so they dont show while youre seated.","Loved the pretty detail of the overlay.","Beautiful dress for a semi-formal summer wedding!"
"wedding","Dress was a perfect fit.","I am typically a 2-4 and wore the 2 comfortably.","The 4 was a little big in the bust/waist for me.","When I first put the dress on the lace on the arms felt a little snug but after about 5 minutes I did not feel constricted."
"wedding","This dress was absolutely perfect for a summer wedding!","The color was so bright and fun.","In the pics, it looks a little peachy or orangy, but it is definitely hot pink/light pink in person.","If you have a larger bust, it may be a little tight on top, but the overall fit is still true to size.","LOVED IT!","P.S.","I didnt wear a bra or anything, not necessary!"
"wedding","I am 57 and 148lbs.","I have curvy hips, long legs and NEVER wear tight dresses.","I gave this one a go and was very pleased.","I always buy Long in pants so I was surprised at the extra length this dress had, even with 4 stilettos on it was a bit long.","As you can see, it fit well and it looked super cute paired with a vintage fur vest that kept me warm outside.","Note that the arm length barely hit my wrists, so at certain points I just pushed up the arms to be more comfortable.","The only downside of the dress was due to weather.","It was raining all day so from walking around outside, the bottom of the dress gathered a ton of water weight.","It was heavy and the fabric didnt allow drying, even after being inside for hours.","After a few drinks though, I forgot about the weight, so no biggie!","All in all, I had a great experience!"
"wedding","The dress fit lovely.","I am typically a size between 6 and 8, so I ordered both.","I ended up wearing the size 8.","The dress was perfect!","I wore it as my wedding gown.","The dress looks fabulous in photos and I got tons and tons of compliments.","My only concern was the chest area.","I am small up top and if I slouched the dress top kind of hung there.","I think it would have been better if I had worn the size 6.","But I absolutely loved it."
"wedding","I wore this for my wedding reception and it was perfect!","My family kept saying I looked like I belonged on a red carpet in Hollywood.","The 10L fit me perfectly and made me feel sleek, sexy and very elegant.","It was also very comfortable!","I am 57 and wore 5 heels with it and the Long was the perfect length.","It was so easy ordering from RTR!","I would recommend this dress to anyone that is looking for a classy look!"
"wedding","This dress was an overall knockout!","It runs large like everyone else on here said.","I also found that I could not wear Spanx or a bra because the Spanx I have are high-waisted and would be seen through the mesh.","The area between the boobs is also just mesh, which is sexy yet sophisticated but a strapless bra would have been seen.","So if youre prepared to bare it all underneath, this dress is one hot item.","Length was perfect for me in 4-inch heels.","I would definitely rent again for a winter formal event."
"wedding","While the dress came late, arrived 1.5 hours before the event instead night before, I was very happy with the fit and color of the dress.","The 8 was a little baggy in the waist,  I wore the 6 which was a bit tight across back of shoulders.","I received many compliments on dress throughout the evening.","The dress was comfortable and beautiful, very happy with the dress."
"wedding","This dress was sent as a backup for a wedding.","I was wary about the cut with the back being so exposed and not being able to wear a bra.","However, I received many compliments and was very comfortable in the dress.","The open back ended up being wonderful in the heat.","The top was a bit snug for me but that worked well since I could not wear a bra.","The bottom skirt portion was a tad big but it was not noticeable to others."
"wedding","I wore this dress as a wedding guest and received several compliments.","The silhouette is very classy and great for a formal occasion.","Im taking a star away because while I liked the material of the top (it was stretchy and had some give), the blue skirt portion is made of a cheaper-looking material (although not noticeable from a distance).","Additionally, the waistband is not sewn to the skirt (it is only attached to the waist at the sides), so the front of the band would shift around throughout the evening and I had to keep adjusting it to make sure it stayed centered between the top and the skirt.","As for the length, Im 51 and the back did drag a bit on the floor (I wore 3 heels) and it was occasionally stepped on by people walking right behind me, but the higher cut front made it easy for me to walk around in the dress.","Seems to fit true to size; sized up only because my usual size wasnt available."
"wedding","I loved the color of this dress.","It is hard to tell in pictures because sometimes it looks different, but it is a bright neon pink.","It is perfect for a summer event.","I got so many compliments and it fit really well.","I actually just bought this dress in the blue for a wedding coming up next month.","The length is perfect, not to short, or too long- and the side holes are cute, but not too revealing or risque."
"wedding","Loooooved this rental.","The dress was made well and the color was gorgeous.","I am curvy so dresses tend to be a little shorter on me which is why I went with the 12.","The sleeves were a little tight on the 12, but the Sz 10 were actually stretched out already.","I loved it so much and my mom is going to rent it next month!"
"wedding","I wore this dress to my friends wedding rehearsal and dinner.","The dress is very tight but completely covered.","I felt sexy but did not feel inappropriately dressed for the event.","The dress is tight but it stretches a lot.","I would recommend you size up because of the slit.","I am a 32DD and had no issue wearing a strapless bra.","This dress is a showstopper.","I highly recommend renting it."
"wedding","I loved this dress, but didnt love it on me that much (because I just had a baby- so the extra weight was a horrible look in my opinion).","Id say if you are concerned about your stomach area, this isnt the dress to rent.","It is very beautiful, colorful, & fit great.","I received a lot of compliments on the dress all night.","For shoes, I lucked up and bought a pair last year which matched this dress perfectly."
"wedding","This dress was lovely.","It was also very comfortable.","It was just a little big for me but a narrow belt around the waist helped a lot.","The fabric was a little lighter than I expected, but that allowed it to drape and flow."
"wedding","As the other reviews said, the sequins do scratch your arms.","The length is great for those of us with long legs but I think it would hit at an odd place on a shorter girl.","Overall, the dress was amazing!","Just rent it, youll be glad you did!"
"wedding","This dress fit beautifully and I got so many compliments on it!","The fabric is stretchy and form fitting but the lace makes it a little more forgivable.","For me there wasnt a huge difference in fit between the 6 and 8, but I have a bigger bust so I went with the 8 because it was a little less snug around the top.","The dress is long!!","I know Im short (hence the joke in the picture lol), but I wore tall heels and the dress still was just a tiny bit too long so I had to make sure to hold it up a bit when I walked.","Also the lace straps were a little too loose, so at times I had to hoist up the top a bit, some fashion tape could probably fix that problem though.","All in all I loved this dress and everyone who saw it told me how fantastic it looked.","Thanks RTR!","!"
"wedding","I wore the Large, even though the Medium fit, I think they forgot some of us have a bigger top half.","I could zip the Medium, but with any sudden movements my chest would have been someones dinner!","I felt more comfortable in the larger size, even though it was a little too big, it was still fit!","I really enjoyed the fabric, it was not itchy, uncomfortable or anything that we all hate.","The slits with the mesh on the side gave it a sexy yet refined look!","This is definitely a perfect LBD!"
"wedding","Overall I was in love with this dress and would definitely consider renting it again!!","This is my second experience with rent the runway and Ive been very happy both times with my dresses.","I ordered the 0 and the 2 and ended up wearing the 2.","The 0 fit perfectly all-around and would have been just right for a night out for a bachelorette or NYE event, etc, but was a little short for a wedding, which is why I went with the 2.","Since the back was open it felt a little loose on top, but I didnt have any issues with it falling off my shoulders (I suggest dress tape, I just didnt have any).","The sparkle on the dress was beautiful and it was very comfortable to dance around in all night!","I got a lot of compliments throughout the night and felt great wearing it!","I highly recommend this dress :)"
"wedding","Im 56, 120 lb, and the 2R fit perfectly.","It was extremely comfortable and I loved the low back.","My chest is 36B and the top provided enough support that it wasnt a problem without a bra.","My only con is that I like to wear at least 2 inch heels and the dress almost wasnt long enough.","It fit my height perfectly at 56, so if you are taller at all then you should order the L version.","Or if you want to wear big heels at 55 or 56 then you should even try the L."
"wedding","This dress blew away my expectations.","The lace is gorgeous in person and I received so many compliments.","I was nervous about the bra situation, but I didnt need one.","The dress, specifically the bust, is so well made it gives you great shape and support without smashing your chest.","The dress was a bit longer on me than it is on the model, but it was still a flattering length.","I would rent this dress again in a heartbeat!"
"wedding","The waist is snug but it didnt bother me much throughout the night.","I got so many compliments and I loved it.","The fabric is thick which makes all the stitching at the waist minorly irritating if your moving a lot.","It was perfect and airy for this summer wedding.","LOVE LOVE the length.","Im glad I read reviews and bought a small slip on Amazon.","It was very much needed.","You could tell if you were looking for it, but I dont think anyone did.","I am usually a 6.","So happy about this one.","Photo wouldnt load."
"wedding","Loved this dress so much!","I have wider shoulders than hips, so not every dress works on me.","This dress was extremely flattering and created the illusion of curves, though.","I felt so confident and comfortable in it, and received compliments all night!","The dress did not fall down, even when I was dancing up a storm.","It is so well-made and the lining did not show how sweaty I got in a 100 degree ceremony under the sun (very grateful for this).","A warning — the dress runs small so I had to size up, and the 4R was a little too long even in 3 heels, and was a tad loose on the hips.","That aside, highly recommend and I wish I could have kept it!","I rented a House of Harlow necklace to go with it."
"wedding","The dress was beautiful quality, not a single snag anywhere.","However, the entire dress AND sleeves are lined with a thick, satin-like material.","The skirt has 4 separate layers!","Not for warmer weather at all, and the arms/chest are very tight.","I am broad-shouldered but do not have a large bust, and this was very difficult to move my arms and be comfortable in.","I would only suggest this if you have smaller arms & shoulders.","Otherwise, it was a beautiful color & quality, and the material itself was soft and comfortable."
"wedding","Color is amazing!","Fabric is heavy like living room curtains so I was hot during the beach wedding ceremony but really comfortable dancing outside as the night grew colder.","Hips hit a little high on me (and Ive never had that in a dress before) and it could raise my arms past my shoulders.","Paired it with bylizlaw.com earrings that matched the swirly pattern.","Got tons of compliments."
"wedding","The top is great, however there is no give in the darting near your bust.","It is heavy fabric that is gorgeous with the detailing and colors.","The bottom of the dress is stretchy and made of a damask type fabric.","Great for women will full hips."
"wedding","Def a little snug in the arms but I preferred that for this lace sheath overlay and lace arms.","I am busty and I still found the 4 to be true to size.","If you are extremely busty and or just like extra arm room, size up.","Beautiful dress!"
"wedding","This dress was AMAZING.","It fit very nicely.","I wore the medium but I could also fit into the small.","The medium was a bit more comfortable as the small was a little more snug-- though they both looked similar when worn.","Im typically a solid 6 and have an hourglass shape.","I felt this dress accentuated all of the right areas.","I wore the shoulder straps lower, I will say the shoulder straps on the small stayed in place better, but the medium was sufficient.","I did have to adjust a few times during the night, but nothing major.","Over all, this was an awesome choice!"
"wedding","Usually a size 4 (58, 130lbs) but wore the 2R for the event, which fit perfectly through the bust and hips but was a bit tight in the underarms.","Got so many compliments on this dress.","Classy and comfortable.","Would definitely recommend it!"
"wedding","All things considered - my height & weight as compared to my 36 bra band - the LelaRose Monet Garden Dress fit very true to size.","It hit me at the narrow part of the leg just under the knee and I thought it was a flattering & demure length; of course, you could shorten it w/hem tape if you prefer.","There are terrific little bra strap holders and I taped the neckline of the dress to my bra - my normal everyday bra - so it wouldnt show if  I leaned forward.","Perfect.","The colors shown are accurate.","I reached a little beyond my comfort zone and, for a noon wedding luncheon at a restaurant, I was perfectly dressed.","I wore it with smashing purple suede pumps - the black in the dress is not quite black enough to match with other blacks - and the Ella Carter Kai earrings; a fine wool crepe blazer took care of the chill and it worked nicely with the ruched sheath.","I gave the dress only four stars because it was a bit frayed around the cap sleeves - loved the cap sleeves - and there were lots of long threads.","Needless to say, thanks again to the two brilliant women who created RTR, so we can all dress and feel like a million bucks!"
"wedding","Dress runs short and small.","Very elegant and great for a black tie event.","I was worried the sequins would look cheap in person, but that was not an issue at all.","I would have been happy if I had just ordered a size larger than my usual size."
"wedding","After reading reviews about the fit of the top, I was really nervous that I didnt order the right size since I have big boobs.","However, the 4 fit pretty well with some adjusting from the bottom.","The top was snug and stayed in place, the boning was helpful but I didnt find that it dug into me at all.","The length was perfect with 5 heels and the color really popped!","I didnt find the fabric to be too thick as some reviews had mentioned, which was appreciated.","I loved wearing this dress and the pockets were especially helpful.","Overall, this dress was a huge hit."
"wedding","I usually wear a size 6, but I found the 4 fit me better.","It was comfortable, and I could move in it easily.","The sequins became slightly scratchy after dancing.","This may not be the case if the sleeves fit my arms a little more snug, and had I not been dancing for a long period of time.","I 100% recommend this dress as well as Rent the Runway for their superb customer service when one of the bridesmaids needed a new size overnight-ed."
"wedding","I wore this for a rehearsal dinner in a Northern Woods weddings, which fit perfectly with the rustic style.","The fit, overall, was right on.","My only complaint was that the slip (built in) was too short and rode up when sitting down for dinner."
"wedding","The color is really like a jewel blue but it depends on the lighting, I wore gold shoes and a statement necklace to dress it up more.","The 12 fit perfectly and had nice room in the hips (my problem area).","The fabric was of good quality but not stretchy, which I was happy about."
"wedding","This dress is just a bright and beautiful in person as it is in the picture.","There is a nice layer of padding across the chest so you dont have to wear a bra.","The only negative about this dress, which most people have said before, is the arms are a bit restricting while dancing, etc.","This is not the end of the world though.","I still danced and had a great time and felt great while doing so."
"wedding","The size 4 fit perfectly, so I didnt try on the 6, Im 510 and 140.","It was my first British wedding.","I found a hat that matched perfectly, and accented with red purse and shoes.","Extremely comfortable for an all day event, and fun to dance in.","I got a lot of compliments, and just loved the lace detail.","I didnt want to take it off!"
"work","The fit on this is great.","It was a nice cropped length to show off some cute sandals.","The fabric is really comfy yet tailored looking.","I wore it with a belt to show off my waist.","The hardest part about this is how low cut the neckline is.","It was hard to find the right top to put with it.","I ended up going with a plain black cami."
"work","The fabric is thick and cozy, and the texture and side slit add something noteworthy to an otherwise uniform work outfit.","My only complaint is the stretch waistband; it just didnt work on me."
"work","This dress is adorable.","It is low-cut, so I chose to wear a tight black tank top underneath.","I absolutely loved the color, and it just looked perfect for my meeting.","I did notice the material was a little thin - not crazy, cheap thin - but it wasnt a super thick fabric.","That was actually perfect for me as it was very sunny and hot where I was."
"work","This dress is just my style, but unfortunately the hips were HUGE in this dress.","I have very straight and narrow hips so that didnt help, but I am normally a 4-6 in many dresses with no issue.","I found the top to smush my chest, while the hips had several inches of excess fabric.","As others noted, the fabric is VERY thick, I imagine it would be warm, think of a wet suit."
"work","This dress is amazing, I kept getting compliments from everyone.","The material was not as soft as I imagined but once youre wearing it, it is incredibly comfortable while still classy and sexy.","I normally wear a small or size 4, but Im grateful that I read the reviews and requested an MR size as back up.","It still highlighted all the right areas without making me feel too exposed.","Im a 58 height, 34B chest but I do have a behind and my stomach is not as flat as I would like it to be, so medium was the better and more comfortable choice.","Would definitely rent again!","To sum up, if you have an hourglass figure and a bigger chest/behind, definitely go for MR or larger (depending on the chest size).","Also very important, I highly recommend wearing a strapless or stick on bra with this, and a thong, or no lines panties."
"work","Very fitted around wrists and neck.","The collar detail does not appear to be refined in person.","It has a light floral pattern.","I would have preferred a collar that was solid white.","The material is thick and stretchy, which really hugs my curves.","However, the weather was way too warm to truly enjoy the dress so I didnt wear it."
"work","I loved this jump suit so much!","The material was very high quality and it was SO comfortable.","Im 55 and it wasnt quite as cropped on me as the picture.","It hit right around my ankle.","Also, since I wore it to wore, I wore a cami underneath for modesty.","Definitely recommend!!","!"
"work","This top of this dress is not leather in the back so it was easier to move around in than other full leather tops.","It fit nicely and looked nice with a button down shirt under it.","Perfect for work, I would rent it again."
"work","I wore this to an outdoor work event and then out for dinner with my husband.","Got lots of compliments: its a fun and unique dress and I think it could work for a lot of occasions.","Nice if you want to dress up but not look too, too dressy.","I am usually a size four and wore the four.","The size two fit but was a bit snug in the ribcage and waist, and also the slip was hanging down past the hem so I would have needed to tape it if I wanted to wear it."
"work","This dress is super lightweight material, which means that you can easily wear tights and sweaters and jackets t layer it up.","There is a great little cut out over the left leg.","It gives it a bit of personality in the cut.","Lots of compliments on this dress."
"work","I really liked the fabric of this dress...its actually constructed with a bunch of triangular panels, which is a nice detail and elevates it from being a basic black lace dress.","My only complaint is that the neckline is slightly gappy...I had to use some double-sided dress tape to get it to stay down and not show my bra, which didnt hold up for the entire day."
"work","Dressy fabric and a little bit of a low back for a work dress.","Would have been perfect for an informal wedding.","Perfect length and I’m very short waisted, but it worked for me.","Color was a dark salmon.","Would seriously consider purchasing this dress.","So many compliments!"
"work","This is a nice dress for work and seemed to be relatively good quality, but nothing particularly notable or special about it.","My one complaint is that the lining kind of rode up at one point, which lifted the flaps of the dress up in the back.","I had to pay attention throughout the day to make sure that didnt happen again."
"work","I wore this to my work Christmas party, which was also celebrating their 10 year anniversary so I had to have a formal dress.","The sleeves around the arms were not tight, which was nice with dancing and hugging people when greeting them.","Im taller than most girls but the length of the dress on me was perfect so I wasnt tripping over it all night."
"work","This dress was a dash big for me, but I was able to make it work.","The material is nice and thick, very structured, but comfortable.","I got lots of compliments on the print of this dress!","I wish the hemline was shorter, but I am pretty petite."
"work","I love the color of this dress.","Generally with these types of knit dresses, I worry that the skirt is too wide, but this one flowed nicely.","The chest was a bit tight and showed my bra lines which I had to cover with a blazer."
"work","I am a DVF girl inside and out, however, this dress just didnt do it for me.","It runs large, and since it is not a wrap dress, it was hard to make fit right.","The fabric is lovely, but this style is not for the every day wearer."
"work","Not a huge fan of the flare from  the waist.","It doesnt hug hips bu rather makes them look bigger.","if you have narrow hips - its a great way to add curves, but if your hips are on the bigger side to begin with  then its not flattering."
"work","The rise was a little too short and the snap closure for the top was a bit precarious.","But it was stylish, in an 80s sort of way, and Id definitely wear it to a cocktail party or lounge setting.","Not really appropriate for a conservative workplace, though."
"work","The blazer does run big.","Id suggest ordering a size or two smaller.","I have broad shoulders and it was still big.","The blazer will go with just about anything and its light weight so perfect for spring/summer nights"
"work","This dress fits like a glove.","I put it on as my first unlimited delivery, and my partner said can you buy that?!","I felt wonderful and am thrilled to start off with Rent the Runway Unlimited on such a great note."
"work","Perfect black minimalist skirt for work and date night!","Im glad it arrived new with the tags still on as it made the RTR discount well worth it.","Id say the 8 is closer to non-vanity sizing, as many higher end lines adhere too.","I take a smaller size in some other brands so Im glad I decided to size up on this as a 6 wouldve been too small.","The length was good on me, longer than on the model since Im a shortie but still a great length.","The shorter piece is above the knee while the longer piece fell over my knee.","I was wearing it a little higher on the waist as Im probably between a 10 and an 8 but in the process of losing weight so the 8 will sit nicely higher for now and Ill let it hang lower as I lose and eventually will have a tailor nip it in.","Its such amazing quality, no VPL and a nice weight.","This will be a great skirt to rent either for you business attire needs or even for evening with a bare or glam top."
"work","A little fancy for work, but with thick black tights it was fine.","The 4 fit nicely for the office.","If I was wearing it elsewhere I might have wanted a 2.","The material is really nice and its lined which is an added bonus.","I probably wouldnt recommend it for a warmer day.","The train is a little more dramatic than it looks in person but I loved it and would rent it again for a cocktail party."
"work","I adored this dress, one of my favorite rentals yet.","I am pear-shaped and found the 8 was form fitting and still had a little room to spare if I found myself feeling bloated after a long day (I rented this dress for a weekend-long training course in NYC, 8 hours straight working and no issues).","Perfect fabric for summer weather."
"work","I wore this for a work event luncheon and I fit in while still standing out.","Its a very unique pattern and generally speaking its very cute.","The con was that the fit was slightly off for me - tight in my arms and I had to be careful about the length because its very short."
"work","This shirt is extremely flattering.","Because I am petite (53) I am always having difficulty with the fit of clothing.","This shirt was perfect.","It was a great length (came just below my hips) and i got so many compliments at work.","I am usually a 6 or 8 (150lbs with my weight distributed everywhere.. my arms a little big) and the 6 was perfect."
"work","Perfect every day dress for work.","Subtle pattern dressed it up a bit.","This was too long, though (below the knee on me).","Slightly less awkward with high pumps but would have been nice in a petite.","Flattering fit and not too tight."
"work","So the blazer is very cute.","I love the back, and it looks great with a nice work dress.","My only concern was the front as the fit was quite loose.","And I suppose it would have to be loose with the open back.","I should have thought of that.","I honestly think this jacket would be great if I carried my weight in the waist.","Alas, I do not and that is not my style - so it didnt work for me.","When I am pregnant, though, I am running to the store to try to buy this jacket.","It would be absolutely perfect for a baby bump!","Thats the kind of loose Im talking about."
"work","It was too short for work without tights but it looked perfect with them!","The dress was a perfect fit for me.","The straps for the slip are really close to the shoulders though so that took a bit of getting used to."
"work","This dress is a very vibrant orange/red depending on what you pair it with.","I originally rented it for work but ending up wearing it to a christmas party because it was definitely not appropriate at my work setting.","If you have any curve then it is several inches shorter than it shows on the model.","The V neck was a little high and did not show off a ton a cleavage which I liked.","The material was very stretchy and comfortable."
"work","This dream is so versatile.","I wore it for an important work meeting but also wore it to an engagement party.","The ruffle detail on the bottom of the dress is so feminine and fun.","It ran true to size and fit really well."
"work","I always wear a 12 in DVF, but this dress runs big.","Luckily its thick but quite stretchy so it still fits fairly well even though I would have gone down a size if I had time.","Im large chested and was worried but this dress is very flattering.","Id wear it again."
"work","I rented this dress to tape the national pledge breaks for Downton Abbey on PBS, so I had very specific needs--I couldnt have anything low cut, white or black or patterned.","I needed a way that a microphone could be clipped on, so nothing backless, and I wanted sleeves because of personal preference.","To say that this was limiting would be an understatement!","This dress fit the bill--I sized up because I had a 1-inch thick microphone pack on my back, but otherwise, the 4R would probably have worked.","The only thing that I would have changed was that the ruching across the tummy, while flattering when standing around, looked wrinkled on camera.","I, and more importantly, my producer, was happy with this dress!"
"work","True to size.","The material is thick and is noticeably worn so the pockets, which are usually a plus for me, sagged.","The liner of the dress peeps out from under the dress (as seen in the pic) so I was constantly pulling up the liner.","Not the best experience but still overall was an excellent outfit that looked pulled together and professional.","I wore a silk ivory blouse underneath the dress for that pulled together look."
"work","I wore this to 2 job interviews, one work meeting and on a casual date night with jeans.","I love that it is lightweight and Chanel-esque - comes across as both playful and professional.","If I ordered it again I *might* go a size up to the 6 but thats because I like to be able to close a jacket completely when I wear it so I dont feel like Im stuffed into it.","It looked totally fine in the current size Im wearing which is a 4."
"work","I LOVED this piece!","I kept it for a while so that I could mix it into my summer wardrobe.","I loved it over a shortsleeved white scoop neck tee and denim of any color really.","So stylish with the belted waist.","I didnt wear it alone as a dress, as there is a stitched detail that is actually see through, and not quite long enough to be appropriate.","But if you are on the shorter side, you may be able to pull that off."
"work","The fit was great.","I was afraid the chest area would be a little restrictive but the sizing worked out well.","The dress has such playful details (pussycat bow and piping) but is still polished enough for work.","Will definitely rent again!"
"work","By design, its intended to be loose so I recommend going down a size.","I loved this - the color was vibrant and fun, great for work.","I wore a tank top underneath it.","I have a long torso and my belly was showing anytime I moved around."
"work","I loved this dress.","I thought it was just black and white but it has little hints of pink in it which made it fun!","I love the bow in the back.","Several individuals said that it was tight in the arms...","I didnt think it was but then again I am really flat chested so it probably made it easier for it to fit on top.","The dress was of a heavier material so i would suggest not wearing it to an outside summer time affair.","I would order this dress again!"
"work","Nothing short of OBSESSED with this top.","It was nice and fitted in the rib cage, but then flared out a bit at the tummy, so ultimately was really comfortable while looking super high fashion and chic.","Dont be intimidated by the sleeves and tuxedo-like longer hem in the back - it feels just like wearing a tailored shirt, just with a bit more flair, for those days when you want to spice it up a bit (perfect for transitioning from a work to date b/c its both strong and beautiful).","I wound up wearing  it with leather pants (like it was shown on the runway) to mix a bit of edge with the sweet pattern."
"work","Didnt love this dress at first but grew to as the day wore on and the compliments piled up.","Runs small so it was tight around the only fitted part, slightly above the waist.","The wrap has a button on the inside, a snap outside, and a belt to tie it together.","The snap kept coming undone but the button and belt held it in place well enough.","Had to wear it with a cami because it was so open at the chest that theres no way you could wear it without something underneath.","All those issues might have been resolved by sizing up.","That said, still a modern twist on a beautiful classic-style dress.","Very unique and got lots of compliments from compete strangers."
"work","This dress was not one of my favorites but still did the job.","Its quite body con so it molds to you (which can be appealing or not depending on your body shape!).","The colors are bright, which is also a personal preference thing.","Overall a good choice and would recommend i"
"work","Dress fits like a dream.","I love DVF wrap dresses.","Im a true size 0 for DVF and these fit slightly tighter than other size 0s.","The top was a little snug, although it still worked well for me and the sleeves were quite narrow.","You would also want to wear a full slip with this dress as the split in the skirt can get quite wide when you sit or walk."
"work","The print and styling are awesome.","I wore it to work and received many compliments.","Beware, the dress does open up in odd places.","I actually had to put small stitches at the bust and at the hem from keeping it from bursting open.","I also work a pair of shorts underneath since the dress is quite short.","Despite all this, I loved wearing it."
"work","Because pretty much every gal freaks for a dress with pockets - this dress is a winner.","I was worried it would look too western but its super cute on.","I got tons of compliments - wish I could buy it!","Very comfortable and appropriate for a huge work conference.","Dressed up yet laid back.","My only gripe was I felt like it was well worn and the fabric a little faded.","For all you (new) working moms - I was able to figure out how to pump in this dress (in private mind you).","Not super easy but not as impossible as with other dresses, so thats a huge win."
"work","Pros: Looks great, feels well made and so comfortable.","Cons: Runs a little big, arms are a bit too short for my frameThis blazer is not white!","It is more of a cream color, just FYI.","I loved the feel of this blazer and felt it was a great rental!","Its so on-trend that you could wear it to work, but also to happy hour after and not look stuffy."
"work","I love DVF -- her wrap dresses are very flattering for pear shapes like myself.","Its a very comfortable material and great to wear for a long day.","I wore it with leggings and ankle boots.","Very true to size, and a stretchy material."
"work","Really fun and unique top but definitely runs small.","I have broad athletic shoulders and usually wear a size 10 in shirts due to them.","It was a feat to get into this 44 (US 12),  it ended up being too small to wear comfortably."
"work","The color of this dress is actually much more of a bright neon cobalt blue in person so if youre looking for a bold statement color, look no further.","I wanted to love this piece, but it was definitely made for a smaller cup size than 34C.","The neckline has a hook closure and it would buckle the fabric when clasped.","Also the length wasnt flattering on my 53 frame.","This would look stunning on someone who is closer in shape and size to the figure in the RTR pictures of this dress."
"work","I wore this on a work trip with black pumps and red lipstick.","I was in a warm climate so it was perfect for warm workday and client dinner afterwards.","My dress arrived with tags still on so I was first to wear.","Loved it."
