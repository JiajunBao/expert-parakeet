"2.0","Maybe I was being lofty but I ordered the size 4 and let me tell you - if you are a little busty then order up because this dress is TIGHT up top.","I usually am a 4-6 but I think for a lot of these dresses its safer to go with the 6."
"2.0","This was my backup dress.","To be fair, Ive never worn a pantsuit and I think my body is just not made for one.","I have no butt and very small boobs...I think you need both to really pull this off well.","The size fit fine but I just didnt look good in it.","Also, pants way too long and baggy for someone my height (53.5)."

"2.0","i rented this dress for a wedding.","Im pear-shaped and got the large but it was way too big in the shoulders...which make me look larger.","it was also extremely scratchy from the sequins.","just by taking it off, it left a big scratch mark on my hand...glad i didnt wear it.","Fortunately, RTR overnighted me a replacement dress that ended up working great."
"2.0","It runs a size large and the fit is not nearly as flattering as this photo.","I have used RTR and been extremely pleased but this one wasnt a great selection."
"2.0","Fits true to size."

"2.0","Unfortunately, this dress was huge and unflattering on me."
"2.0","I loved another E&J rental, so I thought it would fit similarly, but was very disappointed with this rental, as I couldnt wear it for my birthday as I had planned.","I rented bigger, but the dress was still way too short to wear anywhere but a club.","I have a moderately sized chest but it was still loose in the armpits.","Not sure who this dress actually fits, as it was short on me and Im only 56."

"2.0","I was super excited to get the dress, it came too late for me to wear (RTR refunded me for the cost of it) but I was suprised when I tried it on anyways that it was SO short!","Im 5 6.5 and it was so short I couldnt have leaned over to give someone a hug much less sit down...I do have breasts and hips with a small waist so that could have pulled some of the fabric around but all together it was too short and unflattering.","If you are a very hourglass figured girl over 5 5 I would caution against this dress.","Also the M and L were SO differently colored!","One was silver with accents of red and copper and a few black sequins and the other was copper and red with a few silver sequins- so have a couple of pairs of shoes planned in case you get a weird color.","All-around bummer and I will not rent this dress again."
"2.0","This item arrived with a broken zipper."
"2.0","I love this designer but unfortunately this dress had darts in the chest that made the dress unwearable.","Pardon my slang, but the darts give an impression of permanent nipping out.","If the dress had a smooth line over the chest instead of the darts, it would have been great!"
"2.0","This dress is a beautiful color, BUT it has NO stretch or give in the shoulder or arm areas.","I wasnt able to close my car door and giving a hug was a struggle.","Unfortunately, I couldnt last the whole evening in this dress, so I had to quickly shop for a dress between the ceremony and reception."
"2.0","Sadly, I was unable wear this dress because it was just too short.","I tried to make it work, but I just didnt feel comfortable.","If you have any kind of J-Lo butt or hips then this dress will ride up in the back.","I tested it out by going up and down the stairs, and sitting in and getting up from chairs and every time the dress just showed too much.","I was surprised to see that it was so short on my 54 frame.","It was such a shame because it fit me well....I did have to size up from my normal dress size.","It is such beautiful dress but just too short for its own good."

"2.0","The colors are really pretty but unfortunately it was way too much puff for my short frame!"
"2.0","LOVE this dress and was so excited to bring this with me to Vegas.","Got it the night before I left and glad I tried it on because when I did it was WAY too short.","I am 6ft tall and curvy with very long legs and this dress barely covered my butt so unfortunately had to return but definitely a show stopper!"

"2.0","this had the weirdest fit around the shoulders.","i actually have pretty defined shoulders from working out, but it was still large an sloppy looking.","i have a small bust (34A) and it fit fine there, just large in the shoulders.","i would actually buy this dress i liked it so much otherwise, but i would have to tailor it for sure."
"2.0","The dress was beautiful but it did not fit in the bust area and I could see my bust under the lace.","So I could wear this dress"
"2.0","SMELLS AND RUNS SMALL"
"2.0","The sleeves fit fine but this was so awkwardly cropped and it looked like I was squeezing into it when I tried to button it up.","I thought I could make it work leaving it open since the sleeves fit but none of my black shirts looked good with it because of the awkward length of the jacket.","Looked so cute in the pic so I was very disappointed but it just didnt work!"
"2.0","I REALLY wanted to like this... bc my last TT dress was FABULOUS -- BUT it has pockets that stick out at your hips!","If you are a little more narrow or dont have a bootie, it probably wont be an issue!","Also, more red than orange!"
"2.0","I got this for my sisters bachelorette party, but cant wear it.","The size is right around the waist, shoulders, etc.","but it is waaaaay too short, given my long torso.","The waist hits much higher than it should making the shorts just barely cover.","I was excited to try a romper, but I dont think the style works for me."
"2.0","Loved the pattern and colors.","Fabric was a bit heavier than I expected, but I was still excited to wear it until I turned around in the mirror and saw the odd fit at the back of the skirt.","It flared out in a strange and unflattering way.","There was nothing I could do to make it look more normal, so I was unable to wear this dress.","I am bit short-waisted, and also only 54, so perhaps taller women with longer waists could wear this well."
"2.0","wasnt able to  wear due to length"
"2.0","This was my 2nd choice & I did not wear because it was extremely tight across chest & made me flat chested---not flattering.","Im a 38C and it just did not work."

"2.0","Not for petites.","Runs really big and hard to wear with anything."
"2.0","I read all the great reviews, and was so excited to receive this dress.","However, it runs very large and is unflattering.","I really dont understand why it has received so many high reviews.","Not trying to be rude, but if you have a figure, dont waste your time on this dress.","It will hide it, and make you look about 2 sizes bigger."
"2.0","I ordered this dress in a panic but when it came, the color was a light pink.","I was expecting a silver/taupe color.","Im 52 and it was too long I just couldnt wear it.","Also, the pleats made it seem like I was hiding more saddle bags than I have.","I was not happy with this dress and RTR came to the rescue and promptly sent me something else."
"2.0","The 8R was true to size...it has a lot of stretch - but it ended up not being used for a fun black tie because it was just so plain and simple....and not very dressy even though it looks that way in the photo.","The material is just a simple jersey and I wanted more glam."
"2.0","I did not end up wearing this dress, it fit horribly.","I tried to be adventurous and try this dress out, but it was wrong everywhere.","The sleeve and top portion was too big and the bottom was too small.","Because the zipper was on the right side, it kept creeping up my hips and creating bumps that were very unflattering.","The dress rode up no matter what.","Was a real shame.",":( Couldnt even take a picture was that unflattering"

"2.0","I rented this dress for my Friday night dinner before my wedding.","I loved it in the picture.","I thought it was a classy and sophisticated yet fun dress.","But sadly, when it arrived, it was a much darker color underneath of the overlay.","The fit didnt work with my body type.","Made me look somewhat frumpy.","BUT A++++++ to RTR for their amazing customer service for helping me chose a dress, ship it and get it to me the next day just in time for my rehearsal dinner."

"2.0","I am normally a size 4-6, but I was unable to zip up the size 6 dress and could not wear it to my event."
"2.0","Did not wear.","Made me look five sizes bigger."
"2.0","I was really hoping this dress would work, but when I tried it on, I realized it was NOT a true petite.","Women who are actually petite cannot wear regular-length dresses that are just shortened because the torso, arms, and waist are still too long.","I was really hoping this service would work for me, but I need a true petite."
"2.0","I really, really wanted to like this dress.","The material is a gorgeous color and the dress is well made, but unfortunately the style takes all of the form from the shoulders and chest and is quite blowsy everywhere else.","Since I have very broad shoulders and a large chest (32DD) I ended up looking like Id gained 20 pounds under the dress (all I could think of when I looked in the mirror was the Incredible Hulk).","From other reviews, it seems this dress will still work for those with larger chests, but I think the big shoulders + chest combination wouldnt work :( Didnt wear it and sent it back immediately."
"2.0","The fit on this shirt was off, but it was cute, so I decided to wear it to work anyway.","After an hour, I had to go out and buy something else to wear.","This top was a terrible combination of itchy and sweaty.","I dont have very sensitive skin, but wearing this top was absolutely unbearable.","Fit-wise: I wore the 0,  It was big and boxy, and smushed my chest (34C)."
"2.0","this dress was too short for me, so not wearable."
"2.0","This is a beautiful and well-made dress but unfortunately the light colored nude lining did not look right against my Indian skin and thus I could not wear this dress."
"2.0","It was a beautiful color but the dress ran small.","I wouldnt have worn it if I had a back up"
"2.0","The top section of romper was too big, and literally fell off my shoulders.","It opened very deep in the front, and I was constantly checking to make sure my bra wasnt visible.","And the bottom was so short, it barely covered my buns.","So I was pulling up from one end, and down from the other."
"2.0","This dress was really fun and I thought the top fit very well, although probably better for a smaller bust.","Pictures taken of me from a side / profile made me look huge though.","I would recommend this for someone who is more straight and narrow rather than hourglass or curvy."
"2.0","I saw the other reviews saying the straps were long but OMG.","Now I normally have to get dresses taken up 0.5-1 in the straps because my torso is apparently a little short, but seriously the straps on this dress were 2-3 inches too long on me.","It looked ridiculous and made the dress completely unwearable.","I cant see this dress fitting properly unless you have a very long torso."
"2.0","I am typically between a size 12/14 so I ordered this dress in the 12 and the black in the 14 since the 14 in this wasnt available.","When I tried it on it seemed a little tight in around the waist but too big in the chest.","I am a D and it was still loose.","The extra fabric around the hip area was terrible.","It accentuated all the wrong areas on me.","Some of the pictures of people it looks great on them and it is a pretty dress.","I ended up not wearing either due to the fit and sent them back."
"2.0","I wasnt  able to  wear this  dress as it  was  about  2 inches to short...  too bad  as it  looked  fabulous everwhere!","was  really disappointed :("
"2.0","So they didnt have the medium available for my second size so I risked it and just got the small..","IT was super super small.","More like a 0/2 than a 4.","I could zip it BUT it wasnt wearable.","So I had to send it back.","Super bummed but now I have learned to always get the 2nd size option."
"2.0","I ordered a size 4 and 6, but even the larger size wouldnt zip up past the waist.","Im thin but have a healthy-sized chest.","No time to exchange it before the party.","Very sad, because it looks like a gorgeous dress!","!"
"2.0","I usually wear a 4/6 and I rented a 4 and a 6.","All of the other RTR dresses I have used the 4 but even the 6 was too small.","Next time I will get an 8"
"2.0","I loved the way this dress photographed but when I got it, the skirt fabric was so thick and stiff that it made me look huge and very unflattering.","I was so disappointed because it was the only dress I chose to wear to officiate my sisters wedding.","Granted it was a relatively non-formal affair which is why I chose it because it was more party than wedding.","I thought it would photograph well and be a nice contrast to the bride and groom since Id be in a lot of the photos as the officiant but it did not work.","I ended up wearing a backup dress that I already owned."
"2.0","The dress is super short.","I couldnt wear it for the Graduation event that I rented it for.","Fit was perfect overall.","I am 510 and weigh about 160.","The dress was so short that even with flats, you could see my undergarments.","Sad, because other than that, the dress was perfect."
"2.0","I rented this for a wedding and it didnt fit well at all!","Ended up having to send it back."
"2.0","Rented this dress for a wedding but unfortunately did not fit true to size.","The description said runs big so I ordered my size and a size down.","I am usually a true to size 14 but could not zip the zipper at the waist line of the 14R of this dress.","The dress is beautiful though in person.","I would definitely consider renting it again in the larger size.","The detail on the shoulders is a very pretty shimmer/white lace detailing."
"2.0","Based on the site recommendation I ordered a Regular.","Needed Long."
"2.0","The dress was too long and too big in the shoulders.","I tried the smaller of the two sizes I ordered, but nothing worked even with huge heels.","Disappointing to say the least.","Fortunately, I had a back up in my closet.","Maybe next time :("
"2.0","Oy, this was just terrible on me.","Tight in the legs (Ive got muscular legs) and the waist was not flattering at all.","Im chalking this up to a bad style for me."
"2.0","Beautiful top!","Just didnt realize it was cropped.","Would look great with the perfect pair of high waist jeans if youre uncomfortable with baring your tummy."
"2.0","If youre tall, I wouldnt order this dress - it seemed like it was cut for a very petite young girl.","And the fabric was a cheap looking crepe."
"2.0","cute dress, but fit like a large bag.","had to wear a belt.","the dress is made extremely well and should be given how expensive it is.","the buttons are difficult to fasten like the other reviews say.","I wouldnt recommend this dress."

"2.0","mesh does not appear as it did in photo"
"2.0","Did not fit, way too large.","Never wore."
"2.0","Received this dress for a cocktail party and it simply didnt work.","The sleeves were crazy long (went past my fingertips) and the dress was sheer and felt sort of cheap.","I couldnt wear it, mostly because of the length of the sleeves."
"2.0","This looked really frumpy - the length was a little too long.","Has a very vintage look/feel - but not in the good way.","I didnt love this."
"2.0","Big in the hips and bust.","I am normally a size 4 and this felt like 2 sizes too big."
"2.0","No pros.","Cons were that it fits awkwardly and does nothing for your figure."
"2.0","Way too small at size 6.","I dont know if mine was shrunken but it rid up the front and back (not in a flattering or comfortable way) button in front wouldnt stay closed and the lining kept showing (which makes me think it shrunk?).","Went straight back to RTR once I took it out of the bag."
"2.0","I like the material, quality and details, but the top is just too short and boxy.","I tried it with several different pants and skirts, but it never looked quite right.","The cut is so short and boxy that it barely covered by belt.","I returned it without wearing it."
"2.0","It just didnt fit me right, but it was a nice dress and true to size."
"2.0","I consider myself a 00P when shopping.I have a large chest and fit in the dress, I had to pull it up a bit during the night.","I wore 3 inch heels and the dress was sooooo long.","I would not recommend this dress for anyone under 54 this is not a true petite I question if I was sent the regular based on how long it was.","I used hem tape that really didnt work because I would had to tape up 4 inches so it just looked sloppy and it was still too long.","I was tripping over it the whole night.","I dont recommend hem tape on this dress it was very difficult to remove and I wonder if I will get charged because I couldnt take all of it off before my noon deadline to return it.","It was a pretty color and well made.","I was just overall very disappointed.","The bodice also had the metal poking out which was aggravating.","And one more thing, the zipper was very hard to pull up."
"2.0","I did not end up wearing because the dress is HUGE.","And the way that the pleats lay makes it hard to disguise the size of the dress.","Might have been better in a size or two down."
"2.0","Not for woment with thick waists."
"2.0","Didnt fit at all looked awkwardly huge"
"2.0","Besides being too short and looking very awkward in the sleeves because I have more of an athletic build, I was charged for this dress without being able to wear it.","I went out of town for my birthday, & couldnt return it to exchange in time.","I think if your tall, trying on dresses or getting a second style is a must-this is a frustrating experience if not."
"2.0","Im 58 and 120 lbs and I couldnt get this dress to zip.","Plus, the torso and waist line is much higher than pictured.","Go up 1-2 sizes if ordering this dress.","Gorgeous fabric, but very poor structure and fit.","So disappointed."
"2.0","I ordered a size 2  and got a size 0 just in case knowing it was a looser fitting dress (0 is usually too small/tight for me).","The dress was too long and baggy even in a size 0.","I wanted it for a night out in Vegas but it was too big (and itchy) so I ended up not wearing it.","The straps were a good size but I am 53 and the dress went almost down to my knees not at all like the model.","Would be a better outfit for a more conservative event where you dont mind not having any shape but I wouldnt recommend it for Vegas."
"2.0","the top part looks boxy and the sheer white part is too long, long enough to wear leggings with it."
"2.0","Ran large for me and the sleeves (which I thought would be the impact) were very awkward.","I didnt end up wearing it.",":("
"2.0","The dress looked amazing online but it did not fit my body type.","In the zero the top fit but the bottom was to tight and in the two the top was to big."
"4.0","I was not a fan of the material.","I did not end up wearing it"
"4.0","I ordered a size 12 (my typical size) and a size 10, the suggested step down.","The size 10 WOULD have been perfect.","However, since both dresses had difficult zippers and the size 10 had a little less wiggle room but would have fit like a glove (I should have taken more pictures to show), I ended up attempting to wear the size 12.","It fit relatively well in the waist but the shoulders and chest had too much extra fabric and I was practically falling out of the dress.","I attempted to use toupee tape in order to keep the dress from falling off of me and flashing the guests, and for the most part it worked but since it hung off of me so much I found myself attempting to cover myself up the whole time in order not to give anyone a free show.","Between the ceremony and the reception my fiance and I ended up running to target and grabbing a random dress off the rack so Id be able to dance without risk of wardrobe malfunction.","Also, the sequins on this dress are not as comfortable as other reviews led me to believe.","They were scratching up my arms quite a bit and were not sewn on as well as I would have expected.","These dresses were definitely rented and obviously pre-worn, which is expected with a rented dress, but I suggest doing some touch-ups on the sequins and pulled threads that were all over the dress.","Other than that the dress did come on time in the sizes I ordered and was very easy to mail back.","I will be trying RTR again but being more picky about the dresses I choose to rent.","I also would have contacted RTR to switch dresses, but did not have the time and having never used the service before did not know I could do that."
"4.0","I sized down to a small and it fit right but style still looked too much like a sack on me."
"4.0","Relaxed fit coat looks better on tall people than shorties.","Color is more green/turquoise than the image."
"4.0","Dress looked amazing when I first put it on.. but throughout the day it kept twisting.","By the end of the day I was focusing most of my time pulling on my dress to readjust it.","This dress may work best if you are doing little movement or order it a bit large to give it extra give."
"4.0","What can I say, this is statement piece is totally my style in theory, but in real world it didnt work for me at all.","I sized up to get the length and torso space based other reviews  but my torso is still too long so I ended up with a strange combo of camel toe and poochiness, emphasized by the poor seam placement.","The ruffle completely overcame my chest, obliterating my slight hourglass figure.","The combination of elements just didnt work for me, and I felt like I was wearing a costume.","Super bummed as its really cute!"
"4.0","This beading is pretty but the dress itself is short.","I said runs small because the regular was short on me and I am barely 52."
"4.0","I thought this dress was incredibly striking, and I was excited to try it.","Unfortunately, it just wasnt a flattering dress on me.","The fabric is a stiff cotton that has no drape, so it just sort of wrapped around me and looked like a sack.","Too bad!"
"4.0","Ill begin by saying that I had to use 10 pieces of fashion tape to keep the top half of this dress from falling down.","The dress fits true to size if not a bit snug in the waist, but the top is incredibly baggy and droopy.","Even after using all of that tape, I still had an awkward bulge of fabric above my waist.","I thought it might be ok despite other reviews, as I dont consider my bust to be disproportionately small and I have a very long torso, but no such luck.","The dress is also so short that it looks more like a juniors style - and inch or two more on the hemline would make it look more sophisticated.","I will say the color was beautiful and the fabric was light and airy - perfect for a hot summer rooftop wedding.","Still, I would not rent again due to the incredibly awkward fit on top."
"4.0","I was excited to wear this dress because of the unique sleeve detail.","Unfortunately, on my body, it made me look bulky on top."
"4.0","Rented this for my sister to wear to my rehearsal dinner.","She is 510 and around 130 lbs, very athletic build.","It was a pretty dress, but about the length of your average tunic top on her.","You could see her underwear when she stood up straight.","Needless to say, she did not end up wearing it.","I would recommend this for petite girls, but do not order it if you are tall as it will not be long enough for you to wear in public."
"4.0","The dress is beautiful and was brand new.","I was unable to wear it however because it was so large."
"4.0","I loved the color and the back of this but Im a little small chested -32c and this was too big on top, I didnt wear it.","Also the zipper on the XS was in rough shape"
"4.0","I ordered this dress because so many other girls with my body type wore it and liked it.","When I tried it, though, the dress was wayyy too long and super tight around my ribs.","I wear a 6/8 and the 8 for this one was tight.","I am also thicker in the rib area, so maybe not wise for me to try a dress that hits there so tightly.","There was no give, though, and many RTR dresses have a little give to them so I have not had a problem.","Better for a taller, narrower person."
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress - but the fabric has no give to it.","It was extremely tight around the ribcage to the point that it was hard to breath at times.","Unfortunately, I wore it IN a wedding - so I didnt have the option of opting out.","There were 5 of us (ranging sizes 2-14) and we all had the same problem.","We all looked fantastic, but everyone ended up going up in size (we all got the bigger size as the 2nd option, just in case) and we were still extremely uncomfortable."
"4.0","I had tried on other Badgley Mishka gowns in a size 4 and always had them run long, not so with this one.","Im only 55 and even the 4L was far too short to wear heels with.","I had ordered the 4R and 4L and ended up returning both, luckily i was able to borrow a gown from a friend."
"4.0","I am a perfect size 6 in every other Elizabeth and James dress, so I was disappointed when I received this dress and it was baggy, particularly in the chest.","Also, the material is different from their other dresses - the material of this dress is not as thick.","I couldnt wear it.","2 stars because the color is really pretty."
"4.0","Im a sucker for structure and fit, and this dress is kind of a mess.","The fabric, up close, looks and feels terribly cheap, is rather flimsy, and bunches oddly.","The collar is pictured with far more structure than it actually has.","I do think it could look lovely on someone with a more petite frame than I, and/or if you have a bit of shapewear, it not being a particularly forgiving dress.","Soft yet skintight, is the odd descriptor Id give it."
"4.0","This dress was my first choice for an inaugural ball event.","I tried the dress on with 4 inch heels and found that the 2L was far too long for me to wear to the event.","Even with my height (59) and the heels, it was 3-4 inches too long.","The dress fit perfectly up top but dragged on the ground.","In retrospect, since it does fit true to size, I would recommend ordering the dress in both regular and long if you are borderline between the two recommended dress lengths."
"4.0","This dress is slutty and matronly at the same time, if that is possible.","The lace and color is more mature, but the neckline is super low-cut, and the dress is VERY clingy.","The lines in the lace do not create a lean figure, either.","I got this as a back up option, and would never have worn it."
"4.0","This dress is so pretty.","Perfect for the holidays.","Love the long sleeves.","I wanted to like this dress so much however I just couldnt do it!","First, the dress is unlined.","I probably missed that in the description.","It doesnt lay flat in areas that it should and for a dress thats this expensive to purchase I would have expected it to be lined.","Second, the sizing is off.","Im normally a 6 but the torso is so slim that I couldnt get it zipped.","The 8 was better - I could zip it but because the dress was unlined the hip area bulged out on the sides.","Unfortunately I had to return."
"4.0","The skirt fit as expected.","It is poofier than what the picture shows."
"4.0","This dress has a beautiful back and the shine is beautiful.","But if you have a figure with a small waist, this dress is not for you.","The dress does not cinch as the waist well, and when I wore it it glided right over my waist and didnt emphasize my curves at all.","If you have a more athletic or straighter body shape.","then it will probably look good on you."
"4.0","I almost always am a 2 sometimes even a 0 but I hardly could breath once I zipped this dress up.","The material really does not give at all, so just be mindful there is no stretch.","Overall the dress is fine, but I opted not to wear it since it really didnt do anything for me and decided to go with a backup I had in my closet.","The colors were pretty but more muted in person than the vibrant colors they look in the photos.","Id probably opt for one of the other amazing dresses RTR has over this one"
"4.0","This dress was ok.","I didnt wear it though- a little more snug than would have preferred- I have a larger bust and wider back, so felt not much give- I could have worn, but felt it was more suited for someone w/a slighter frame.","Not as flattering as most of the dresses I rent.","Often I wear a 6 or an 8--depending on style, designer, etc.","If youre flat chested, likely will work better.","Did think it was pretty for an event that you want a lot of femininity for."
"4.0","I was excited about this dress, but it didnt look good on me at all.","A main reason I had problems was the pockets at the hips.","Even though I only wear a size 4, the bulky fabric and lining combined with the bulky pockets made me look super-thick in the hip area.","It literally added 15 pounds to my look!","Additionally, this fabric, as I stated, is THICK.","I would have roasted in this even in the winter.","Disappointed it didnt work out.","I had to send it right back."
"4.0","I didnt get to wear it because the back was too baggy and open.","Wasnt flattering.",":("
"4.0","This Cut 25 Brush of Burgundy dress in 6 is purple and has short sleeves with a crew neckline and is a full skirt.","This dress is for someone who has a larger brest.","This dress is  too heavy for me.","The body type that should wear this dress is someone who is tall.","This dress as a back zipper with an hook-eye closure."
"4.0","The dress was a nice light weight cotton for summer.","It is a trapeze dress and needs a belt, mind didnt come with the belt.","I didnt wear it."
"4.0","fabric was nice, but pants were too long and bust wasnt flattering."
"4.0","At 58 regular dresses are usually ok or too short for me, not this one.","Even with 3 1/2 heels the regular length gown dragged the ground.","Overall, very plain gown so I didnt wear it to the event."
"4.0","I didnt wear this dress because it didnt look good on me.","It emphasized my hips and make me look even more pear shaped than I am.","Probably better for someone without a lot of curves to begin with."
"4.0","Unfortunately, this item was even larger than reviews indicated!","The moment I took it out of the bag, I thought it looked huge and had to double check the tag!","It was totally unwearable, at least 2 sizes too big compared to the fit of other jumpsuits/rompers Ive tried."
"4.0","great color but a bizarre fit.","tight and uncomfortable in the chest but poofy,/too big in the waist.","I did not end up wearing this dress."
"4.0","I had to order a size 2 because the 0 was unavailable.","I highly recommend that if you are petitie that you do not order this piece.","I am short, so i thought the shorts half was too long.","Really only good for tall, moderate build people."
"4.0","I went with another Bagdley Mischka for NYE.","The color of this one is a darker gold than in the picture and for some reason looked kind of cheap to me.","It was also way longer (to my knee) than I wanted for NYE.","The fit was great, but I didnt really like anything else about this dress for my event."
"4.0","This runs super large.","Im normally a M/L in dresses because of my hips, and I probably shouldve gone with a S in this due to how much extra fabric there was around the arms and in the torso.","The length was good, though, and I think its supposed to err on the side of a roomier fit anyway.","Cute pattern!","Update: rented the S. Still didnt fit well.","The sleeves are really flowy, which is fine, but the armpit essentially joins at the waist, so I ended up looking super boxy."
"4.0","It was okay for just a holiday party, we didnt really go out anywhere afterwards.","It was a little big on me, the straps were too long and there feel like there was a lot of fabric bunching up.","I didnt even have pictures of me in it so i guess that sort of says it all!","Haha"
"4.0","The dress was great, it fit well and it was very comfortable and flattering so that it hid nay unwanted tummy shots.","Unfortunately the dress was forgiving but also too matronly for me.","It came down to my knees and was so roomy in the skirt section that it looked like someone in their late 30s or 40s would wear.","Im only 27 so I was looking for something with a younger look for new years eve."
"4.0","Unfortunately I couldnt wear this rental as it was extremely large.","Lovely material, felt comfortable.","I wish it didnt look like I was lost in the dress though."
"4.0","The color and embroidery were pretty, but I couldnt wear it.","The top was so tight I couldnt get it zipped.","I read the reviews and ordered the larger size hoping to avoid this problem.","I guess the designer is only thinking about girls with smaller chests."
"4.0","I rented this for a daytime Graduation/Mothers day party.","I usually wear a 4 and rented the size 8 and 10 and even the 10 was tight in the hip area, I ended up not wearing the dress because it bulged up in the back which made it look very unflattering, I like the length as I am 51 and it looks like the perfect length."
"4.0","The material is extremely comfortable!","beautiful gown just too plain for the event that I was going to.","Therefore, I did not wear this gown but my back up instead.","This gown ran big for me, so also the fit was loose and didnt look as right,"
"4.0","Loved the color and the dress overall was very unique and pretty.","However, the fabric has no stretch at all and  was not very comfortable.","Much shorter than expected.","Quality was fine and it was made well, but be careful when renting because it  feels stiff and was not easy to dance in at all.","Would have been better for something other than a reception."
"4.0","As other reviewers note, it was SNUG at the waist and the camisole lining on the top would never lay smoothly, giving it an unfortunate wrinkled appearance.","The underskirt on mine was also bent and creased, so the back of the skirt didnt lay right.","The larger size fit me, but wasnt in good shape, so I had to order a backup (which RTR was AMAZING about!)"
"4.0","Beautiful color!","Love the dress, but it just did something funny with the pockets at the hips for me..."
"4.0","Ruffle bottom was awkward looking."
"4.0","I ordered this in a 10 after my other dresses I ordered did not fit in 6 or 8.","This was a 10 and the other dress I ordered was a size 8.","I would have really been in a jam trying to pick between the two however because I loved both.","I think the lace work is so adorable and the color is lovely, especially for an evening wedding.","The 10 was just a hair too big though so I ended up going with the 8 in the other dress.","However, if I do have another wedding come up, Ill definitely be renting this in the 8!"
"4.0","This dress is just my style, but unfortunately the hips were HUGE in this dress.","I have very straight and narrow hips so that didnt help, but I am normally a 4-6 in many dresses with no issue.","I found the top to smush my chest, while the hips had several inches of excess fabric.","As others noted, the fabric is VERY thick, I imagine it would be warm, think of a wet suit."
"4.0","Im 53 130 lbs and usually wear a size 2 or 4 in dresses.","I wear a 34 B in bras.","The dress fit oddly on me.","The chest was bit loose and the bottom flared out too much for my liking.","I ended up feeling like a little girl wearing the dress, rather than a woman.","The dress seems to look on some, but it just didnt work out for me."
"4.0","The color is gorgeous and the dress flattering, but it ended up being more appropriate for my 55-year-old mother than for me!","I admittedly am pretty hard to fit, but I found it ran pretty huge, especially because its got a lot of stretch.","It also wasnt quite as youthful a gown as I was hoping for.","The 0L was perfect for my mom who is usually a 4 or even 6...at least she looked amazing in it!"
"4.0","It arrived a few days before the wedding and I ended up having to get a replacement because this was just WAY too long.","I am 54 and it was at least 2 inches past my heels."
"4.0","It made me look like 20 lbs heavier!","The material is pretty, light, and airy and the design is unique, but it was one of the least flattering pieces of clothing Ive ever worn!"
"4.0","It was a beautiful dress.","My boobs seemed to be to big to wear it comfortably."
"4.0","Not meant for girls who are busty."
"4.0","Gorgeous dress, however it runs very small.","It was difficult to zip up and the collar was extremely tight.","I had the dress on for no more than 1 minute and by the time I took it off, there were red mark around my neck from the collar.","I wish the large had been available because that definitely would have fit!"
"4.0","This dress was pretty, hard to zip up and much too low cut for my work event.","Had to return it and unfortunately a replacement wasnt available."
"4.0","I like the idea of this romper but the color is pretty drab in person and I have no idea what you would wear under it.","It shows every bump and curve and you would have to wear some kind of bra unfortunately.","Its really cute but not a great as I expected."
"4.0","Pro: nice styleCon: too big in waist and hard to put on"
"4.0","Ok, normally I can wear a S or M but in this dress NO WAY!","Im a D Cup and the material didnt cover me at all.","I couldnt wear it in public.","Be aware if you want to try this dress go a size bigger!"
"4.0","I ordered this just for a fun weekend and while i wore it, it was nothing special.","The top was pretty baggy even though the straps were adjustable, so I wore a jean jacket the entire time.","Im excited to try more dresses from this designer, but probably not this one again."
"4.0","Dress was way too long and made me look frumpy.","Looks better in the photo."
"4.0","I rented both the XS and a S for my companies holiday party last  year.","Unfortuantely the XS was not available last minute (my replacement dress was awesome though).","I tired on the S, and it was just too large for my petite body.","Because I am so short, the dress went down to my knees and the shoulders jetted out making me look like I was going to an 80s flashback party.","If I were taller Im sure this dress would have looked fabulous, but I felt like I was a kid playing dress up."
"4.0","The material is beautiful, but too stiff."
"4.0","Super cute dress from the front, as long as youre not moving, i.e., pictures, standing in place.","However, if youre human and plan on walking and possibly dancing in this, Im not so sure this is the most practical dress.","Upon taking a few steps, it began inching up my thighs and I felt like I had to constantly pull it down.","Its very short to begin with, let alone when it starts creeping up your legs.","No fault of the dress--I knew how open the back was when I ordered it--but I felt very exposed in it - the short, inching up hem, paired with a nearly fully open back was a little too much skin for me.","If youre like me and enjoy a fun splashy dresses every now & then in the spring/summer (which is why you are reading this) but dont like showing too much skin, I would not recommend renting this - despite how fun the design is.","Bachelor party in Vegas?","Yes!","Wedding in a small town, No."
"4.0","99.999% of the time I take size XS, which is the size I ordered in this romper.","I generally consider myself to have a small backside, but the shorts on this romper fit like hot shorts, making it unwearable in public.","I did order size S for back up but it ended up being unavailable, so I cant comment on whether this size would have been more appropriate."
"4.0","initially i got this dress as a second choice and i wish i couldve changed it.","i didnt like the way it looked on me.","it just looked like it just hung on me and it didnt give any snhape at all.. the sequins were pinchy but i guess i expected that but overall i didnt like it..i looked larger in it and it didnt just didnt look right..."
"4.0","The dress is cute, however, I had issues with how thin the liner was.","My backside and all of its lumpy glory was exposed and the dress was too fitted for me to conceal a pair of spanx under.","I dare say the dress liner even added lumps and bumps, but that may just be wishful thinking.","I did not end up wearing it to my event and wouldnt suggest renting it."
"4.0","This is a great little TUNIC, not a dress.","at all.","I fully expected this to be short and to have to wear tights but it didnt even cover the bare minimums, and Im only 5 ft. 4in.","Otherwise, I thought the 8 ran true to size and fit perfectly everywhere else.","Sadly, couldnt wear this for a fun wedding at a jazz club."
"4.0","I got this dress and other one for prom and didnt end up wearing it because the way the fabric hit me it made my hips look wide."
"4.0","Im a 4/6, 34DD and M was too small in the chest.","Wore this to work but wouldnt rent again...MEH."
"4.0","Tight around the rib cage and large around the chest"
"4.0","The fit was very bad.","I did not wear it.","The top part was too loose and was not flattering."
"4.0","I loved this in theory, but it sucked in practice.","Only rent if you are prepared to go braless.","I cannot after nursing two babies.","I wore this with nu bra cups, and it really didnt work out.","I was babysitting my breasts all evening, trying to keep them from sneaking out into the front cutout.","And when you have to pee in jumpsuit, you have to pull the whole thing down.","Rearranging the cups and everything after each pee break was such a pain."
"4.0","This dress was a very simple/reserved dress that fit the atmosphere for the award ceremony I was attending.","However, I felt a little matronly in this dress.","It ran long and didnt give my body much shape."
"4.0","I usually wear a 12 and sized up to a 14 for this, but it was still too small to sit down in."
"4.0","This dress is way too big for a person with a petite frame––the top didnt fit at all, and the material on the skirt was far too voluminous."
"4.0","Wayyyy too big and the bows that tied at the shoulders were completely unnecessary.","It could have been so much cuter, unfortunately I couldnt wear it and it looked much better on the hanger."
"4.0","The fit of this dress was very similar to what I was expecting - nice, thicker scuba-like fabric that creates a flattering silhouette - however the pattern was way too busy and vibrant.","The colors seemed a bit more muted online.","Wont work for the bridal shower I had intended to wear it for, but lovely dress for someone who isnt taken aback at the pattern.","**please also note fit was good even though im about 10lbs heavier than my normal stats listed due to being 4.5 months pregnant --- nice and stretchy fabric!"
"4.0","Beautiful dress with great material and sexy.","However, Long dress to Long, Regular too Short.","I have ordered many times from RTR and do not have any issues; but both dresses were not in good condition.","The long dress has a malfunction below the zipper where the dress forms a bubble.","The hem on the short dress was loose.","Unfortunately, not my best rent."
"4.0","I wore a different David Meister dress in a 4 that fit well.","This dress was too tight - I could not zip it all the way up.","There is not as much give in the material.","I could have fit in a 6."
"4.0","I rented this dress for everyday wear and was pretty disappointed with it.","Its very very loose, and it sort of looked like I was wearing a nightgown.","The pattern is pretty and the cut of the skirt is fun, but the dress was ultimately just too baggy and I didnt wear it."
"4.0","Loved the floral fabric and pattern along with the mesh detailing.","Unfortunately, I was unable to wear this dress because I could not get it over my wide hips.","Total disappointment."
"4.0","Did not love it.","Busty short girls beware.","This dress will not compliment your body type.","Length hit mid/lower shin on me - matronly for this gal.","Would have been cuter if I could have hemmed it to be just below knee like the model.","Also lots and lots and lots of ruffles (very full double ruffle) all around only magnified how top heavy I am.","Would look great on a tall thin person.","Empire waist and VERY full skirt.","Lots and lots of flowy fabric on the bottom.","Would be a great maternity dress as it would accommodate any size baby bump.","Pros - bright pretty colors.","Im sure this would be a gorgeous dress on a different body but made me look older and frumpier than necessary."
"4.0","Its a nice piece but in the end, too busy for me and the bottom edge hit right above my hip and I would have preferred below my hip."
"4.0","While the dress was a really beautiful color and made of seemingly great material, I found it less than flattering on me.The straps were a little wider on my frame than I would have liked, and the skirt was very stiff and folded in an odd way.","I ended up not wearing this dress."
"4.0","This dress is so see-through that you definitely need a slip or something to wear underneath."
"4.0","Peplum is not for anyone with anything other than a flat stomach."
"4.0","Bright and cheery print.","Its totally unlined and really flowy.","If I cared enough to rent again, Id actually size down two more sizes, but I think its just the style of the dress and how it is meant to hang on you that I didnt like.","The included belt is very slippery, so I found myself having to tie it over and over again.","I didnt leave the house wearing it though I tried it at home for about an hour to see if I could get used to such a different fitting dress.","My husband said it was cute, but after I put on another dress he agreed that this yellow one was less flattering."
"4.0","I was so excited to get this dress, which looked like it would be perfect for a summertime 30th birthday party that was going to be a little bit upscale.","I was so disappointed to receive the dress and realize the fabric is actually a thick, stretchy jersey-knit.","Too heavy for florida summer and not nearly as flattering as the picture.","Bummed."
"4.0","This dress is really short so I couldnt wear it to a wedding."
"4.0","I normally wear size 0 or two and ordered a size 0 for this dress.","Its still too big and hangs loose."
"4.0","I am 57 and this dress touched the top of my feet without shoes on.","Would recommend a long for any girl about 56 who whats to wear heels."
"4.0","This was my back up dress and it was WAY too big on the bodice and the length was really long.","Beautiful color and dress thought wish it wouldve fit"
"4.0","The fit of this is incredibly small, especially in the sleeves.","The midsection of the dress does nothing for a curvy figure.","Overall, much better for a short, petite, figure."
"4.0","The dress itself is a nice material and made it easy to wear in the summertime.","Unfortunately it fell short as it provides no definition to the body.","I liked the length but it felt large on top.","It could work well for a day of tennis or at the beach."
"4.0","I rented the Draper James Floral Dunaway Vines Beverly Romper for my birthday in an 8 & a 10.","I was at a convention when I was notified the 10 was unable to be shipped to I was sent this romper instead in a size large.","The romper is so cute and a great back up however it does not even compare to a 10 a size large.","My waist is not the issue for smaller sizes it is my bust and neither zippers worked.","Fortunately the 8 in the Draper james romper was perfect because this romper was not.","I recommend this for small petite girls."
"4.0","I was so excited to finally have an occasion to rent a dress from Rent The Runway...my wedding shower.","I went back and forth between so many dresses, but I finally chose this dress.","It received so many great reviews and from what I read, it seemed to fit my occasion perfectly.","Unfortunately, it was too long and didnt show off my assets...my legs.","It felt a bit motherly to me.","I wanted to love it, and for the price, I definitely tried it on several times to convince myself.","But for my couple wedding shower, I wanted to feel hot, and this dressed fell short.","It was true to size though.","I received the dress on Friday night and didnt have time to send it back that night to choose another dress, so I had to run out on Saturday and purchase something else.","I hope to rent again though!","!"
"4.0","The dress looks really swingy, like it has a full skirt.","In reality, the skirt is much more fitted and hugged my curves in ways that I didnt find flattering.","It looked a little sloppy.","I saw the dress on several other people at the party I attended, so I was really glad that I didnt end up in it.","We could have formed our own sequined flash mob.","Yikes!"
"4.0","If youre petite like I am (54) I would double check the length of this dress.","I rushed my unlimited order so I ended up choosing this dress because of the color and the neckline.","Unfortunately, the dress was way too long and would end halfway down my knee and I looked short and out of proportion."
"4.0","The unique design and vibrant colors on this dress sold me!","Unfortunately, I was not anticipating the fabric to be as stretchy and thus the dress to be as form fitting.","At 57, I felt that the dress was far too short to wear to the wedding I had rented it for, plus when I walked it rode up and got even shorter.","I am more of a conservative dresser, so if you like a shorter more figure hugging dress, then this dress could work for you.","I hate that it didnt work, such a cute dress!"
"4.0","The pattern looks super fun and interesting, but in person it looked very cheap.","The part of the dress that hangs on the arms is HUGE.","I literally had to take some safety pins to the front of the dress and Macgyver  it to look somewhat decent.","Ive been renting from RTR for a couple years now.. hands down my worst rental.","If you still feel like renting, make sure to size down."
"4.0","Too big - didn’t wear"
"4.0","I  wore this dress to my senior homecoming dance and I could not eat, breath, or dance in this dress!","Its beautiful as all get out, but wow!","I accidentally ordered a 0 and a 2 (because some reviews claimed the dress ran small).","Its pretty loose in the shoulders but it was so tight on my hips.","Because I had no other option, I squeezed into this dress anyways.","It was fine but I was so sad that it wasnt perfect."
"4.0","I rented three Diane Von Furstenberg dresses, all at the same time, all size medium.","The other two fit me perfectly but this one was so tight I couldnt wear it even once!","I would get a large for this dress next time."
"6.0","This dress is really cute on the model, but was really awkward on me.","The sleeves were really lose around my arm and just didnt fit well at all."
"6.0","Well made and comfortable.","Not really going to turn any heads in this one, but its a safe solution.","Runs slightly small, so I suggest reserving a size up.","Beware if youre ordering the longer version thinking the sleeves will be longer.","Im not very tall, but found the sleeves to be too short."
"6.0","I have to agree with previous reviews, this is not the best dress if youre petite.","Im 54, I didnt have any problem with the length of the actual dress, but the sleeves were too long.","It does run a little big, Ive recently been an 8, and I wore the 6 and could have fit in the 4.","Nice and warm though!"
"6.0","Others liked this top better than I did.","I was expecting a sweater, and its a very lightweight top that looks almost like a sweatshirt.","Maybe I was disappointed that it wasnt a sweater, but I wasnt too excited about it, but others liked it on.","You could change the look by wearing it with a navy pencil skirt and heels, but I was planning to wear it for a casual evening, so I wore it with jeans."
"6.0","This dress arrived extremely wrinkled.","I do not own a steamer...luckily my husband had some extra time before our event to iron out some of the wrinkles but it was still pretty bad.","I wore it anyway, and luckily we were sitting for most of the dinner and I could cover it with my coat when we were outside mingling.","I got a lot of compliments on the color of the dress...but unless you have an hour or two to get out the creases- dont rent this dress!"
"6.0","I originally tried on the 12R and it fit fine its just that im super short, so my stylist suggested to order my dress in a 12P which I did but when I tried on my dress a few days before the wedding we couldnt zipper the dress.","I was in a state of sheer panic and had to order the dress a size up in a 14R which was big but I managed."
"6.0","I loved the dress, but it was definitely tighter than it appears on the model.","Perhaps it is not best suited for someone with hips, but would probably work best one someone with a more straight and narrow figure.","Also I am 56 and wore 3.5inch heels and the length on the long was perfect.","I would definitely go for a long if you are 56 or taller and planning to wear heals."
"6.0","Just an okay dress.","Nothing special.","Fit was like many of other DVF dresses.","I usually order up a size or two, so the size 6 fit me (I usually wear a 4 in other brands).","Will probably not rent again."
"6.0","I loved this and thought it would be perfect for a dressy casual dinner party.","The unfinished seams of the heavy weight fabric definitely added some panache to the floral fabric, but the 14W waist was a lot smaller for me than the supplied Carmen Marc Valvo measurements.","Unfortunately the 16W wasnt available this weekend.","I might re-rent when the 16W is available for the right event."
"6.0","This skirt is cute, but tight!","I wore it right around my ribs/right under my boobs.","I like my skirts high-waisted so I got the 4.","After I ate dinner it was definitely tight!!","Id go up a size if you want some extra room.","I also found it odd that it had these black strings hanging from the flaps on the front of the skirt.","I didnt see them in the pictures on the model, and thought they looked odd.","I was told by RTR its just the style!"
"6.0","I like the dress for the quality, but the slip underneath it was troublesome... it hung lower than the hem of the dress, so when you walked it was extremely noticeable.","The dress itself was very high-quality and I loved the detail.","Unfortunately, it had to many misses to be a win for me."
"6.0","The dress itself has pretty details, but I wasnt too crazy about it."
"6.0","Did not wear dress, not very flattering on my body type"
"6.0","The neckline is interesting, but is really a lot higher than it seems on the model.","The longer length and lack of cleavage made it a bit more conservative than i expected.","I also noticed that the slit was actually not on the side as it seems in the picture - it is right up and down the middle of your legs in the front, which is kind of award.","The material is nice and thick, but not very stretchy and is very textured, which was also unexpected."
"6.0","This dress was okay.","I tried both the 10 and 12 and ended up wearing the 10.","It still was a little big on the shoulders but fit everywhere else.","It probably looks better on thinner ladies.","I felt a little frumpy in it.","Its very low cut and short and I didnt have the right shapewear that wouldnt show."
"6.0","Too much flair at the bottom."
"6.0","Im 53 and the 0 regular was long, I wore tall heals with a little bit of a platform on the front so my shoes luckily added to the length.","However, I would have went with a short had I known."
"6.0","I rented this dress and did not end up wearing it.","Its a beautiful dress and Ive seen it in other colors.","But this black color seemed to make me look frumpy.","It accentuated my waist and made it look teeny tiny .","However, probably because of my height, but the bottom of the dress hit my knees in a way that was not flattering.","I felt too covered up, like an old lady.","Also, the zipper in the back made the material hang heavy and fall in an awkward way.","I would have had to wear my hair down to cover it.","You can wear a bra.","strapless or one with clear straps."
"6.0","I loved the style, colors, and pockets on this dress, and I received a ton of compliments!","It was perfect for a June wedding.","The only downside was that I felt as though I fell between sizes, so it was either too tight or too loose in the bust.","I went a size up to be more comfortable, but found myself tugging on the dress a lot to make sure my strapless bra wasnt showing."
"6.0","The dress was very fun and lovely.","However, I have an hourglass figure with wide shoulders/back, and the dress was very tight up top.","If I ordered this dress again Id go a size bigger.","Everything else about the dress was great."
"6.0","This top was just ok.","I didnt find the cut or print to be particularly flattering.","Wore it with jeans to have drinks with friends.","From the front it looks conservative and good for work or church.","The back detailing is a little too risqué for wearing during the day to most places, and shows most bra straps."
"6.0","Very tight across the chest.","If you have a larger chest (Im 36C) the material pushes it down.","May want to size up to make room for cup size.","Beautiful material and a gorgeous vibrant color."
"6.0","While it is generous in fit as far as blousy-ness goes, it runs short in the torso and sleeves.","If you are a bit taller it feels like a poor fit.","I did not care for the space to the sides that is a couple of inches shorter than the front and back.","It gave the effect (for me) of a saggy diaper in the back.","I loved the color and fabric but for me the design and fit spoiled it."
"6.0","comfy and chic, however clearly not meant for bustier ladies.","no bra was needed;it was thick fabric and supportive but my boobs were coming out the sides so I had to wear a crop top over it.","very cute though.","for reference I am 5 4 135 lbs and 34dd."
"6.0","I love these dresses  that look like tops and skirts-- theyre so comfy to wear to the office.","But with this dress, the skirt is VERY full.","It has pockets, which I love, but I did not expect the skirt to be so dramatic.","It was far too much volume for work.","The top fits great and is very comfortable.","Fantastic red color."
"6.0","The bright colors and pattern of this blouse were fantastic.","Unfortunately, it was far too tent-like to be flattering, so I sent it back without wearing it.","Maybe a size or two smaller would have done the trick."
"6.0","I loved this pattern, but unfortunately wasnt able to wear.","There is a belt sewn in at the waist that I wasnt able to secure.","It also was very low cut.","Length would have been good (about 2in above my knee).","Would order up next time.","A shame, since its so cute!"
"6.0","This dress is cute and can be dressed up or down.","I rented it for a fairly casual daytime bridal shower.","I am usually a 4 but it runs a bit large.","The 2 was unavailable but given the option I probably would have worn the smaller size.","Definitely need the pop-of-pink necklace to accessorize this dress!"
"6.0","Dress was absolutely gorgeous and fit me beautifully up top, but unfortunately was far too long.","I am 53 and was tripping on the dress and it was dragging on the floor, even with 3.5 heels on.","I wouldnt recommend this dress for anyone under 56, and even then youd need a sizeable heel.","I wish they made a short version, because the fabric and colors and fit otherwise were really beautiful."
"6.0","I loved the lace detail over the fitted bodice.","The sleeves added the perfect modesty yet still sexy for a more conservative crowd.","I got compliments all night.","The dress fit true to size.","The only con was you definitely need help with the buttons in the back and I was very cautious putting the sleeves on because they are very delicate.","But this dress was a winner!!!","!"
"6.0","The size 6 ran really large, so I recommend checking out smaller sizes for this one.","I wish it fit me!","It was gorgeous."
"6.0","The mesh material is really interesting, and I liked the bottom half of the dress a lot, but the top was a little plain and I didnt think it was very flattering.","Nothing really negative to say, it was fine and did the job at a summer wedding, but it didnt really stand out as anything special."
"6.0","This dress was perfect.","The material was soft and flowy.","It was very bump friendly.","It was just what I needed for an outdoor wedding event."
"6.0","Very cute dress (really - quite cute) but runs very large.","Sleeves were so long you couldnt see my hands and the dress came down to below my knees.","Was hugely voluminous.","I assumed a 2 would be a bit big but I was absolutely swimming in this!"
"6.0","I love fit and flare dresses, and I loved the Clover Canyon dress I rented in the past, so I was excited to try this.","Unfortunately, I couldnt wear it because I am short-waisted, and the waist on this dress hit well below my hips, causing fabric to bunch up around my waist.","My husband wasnt a fan of the print on the dress.","He said I looked like a geisha.","The sleeves on the dress fit really well, and the length on me was about one inch above my knees.","I would recommend this dress for someone taller and straighter who is willing to try an unconventional pattern."
"6.0","This fabric is very thick and creates more volume than I expected but I still received plenty of compliments."
"6.0","It was a little bit too flashy for the event."
"6.0","Very thick fabric, so dont wear it anywhere warm.","The dress was a bit too long for me and it went past my knees (Im 55).","Usually a size 4, but that was too big.","Size 2 was almost perfect, but the sleeves were a bit long- they ran past my wrists.","The fit for me in general was a bit awkward, so I didnt wear it at all."
"6.0","Be careful if you have a big booty and hips.","V is quite deep too."
"6.0","I thought that this dress would hide a little tummy since it has extra material, but I was wrong.","I dont have a massive tummy, but it fits almost like spandex and was not flattering.","I wouldnt wear this if I wasnt under a size 6 athletic build if I was you!","I ended up going with my back up."
"6.0","I loved the style of this sheer sweatshirt and was hoping to wear it casually for dinner with friends.","However, as other reviews stated, it runs small.","Im a 36C and have muscular upper arms and found it too tight across the chest, shoulders, and upper arms.","I was concerned Id tear it when I took it off.","Thankfully, I didnt.","Its also a tad short for someone like me (59 with a slightly longer torso than average).","I would have needed a 14 but that wasnt available.","If youre smaller in both height and bust/shoulders/arms I think this would work well for you.","I sadly returned it without wearing.","I hope this helps someone else avoid my mistake in ignoring other reviews.","If youre lucky enough to wear this I think youll love it!"
"6.0","I ordered this as my back-up dress and it was absolutely stunning.","The fabric and detail are perfect if you love a classic look without looking Plain Jane.","There was only a size smaller left than I typically wear so I went with it and it fit perfect everywhere but the bust.","I have 34DDD so it probably wouldnt do this normally to women, but for me it smashed my chest into an awkward shape.","I think even if I had ordered a size up the straps would have had too much slack and dropped the waist line too low."
"6.0","Rented for a bachelorette party where I needed a black dress.","Nothing spectacular about the dress.","A little short but didnt feel uncomfortable.","Normally wear between a size 2 - 4.","Tried on the small and it fit great so I didnt even try on the xsmall.","This is one of the lessor expensive black dresses to rent so for the cost it did the job."
"6.0","I wore this dress for a graduation ceremony.","The design/pattern of the dress is very cute and different.","The fit runs large in the mid-section, there seems to be some extra fabric in this area.","I wore the small and also had the x-small as a back-up but ended up wearing the small.","The x-small was too tight for my personal liking in other areas on my body but the mid-section fit better on the x-small.","Overall I felt more comfortable in the small and I knew I would be sitting for a long time."
"6.0","Unfortunately for me, this dress does not fit like others from Shoshanna that Ive worn.","I usually size up to accommodate a 34DDD bust - and on this dress, the top was so large that the straps kept falling down.","(The next size down fit properly in the bust but was too small in the waist.)","Additionally, the back is surprisingly low, meaning that you have to wear a backless or very low backed bra to keep it from showing.","I loved the color of this dress, but was disappointed overall - I ended up switching it out for my backup dress, and was much happier."
"6.0","It fit everywhere except my hips.","It was a bit too narrow in the hips.","Love it otherwise."
"6.0","Beautiful dress, but did not wear due to the dress running a bit large"
"6.0","Cute dress but is very long.","I am 54 and was down almost past my knees.","Fit is good though - loose but doesnt drown you"
"6.0","The color, fabric and quality of the dress were beautiful.","The dress ran a bit long on me, however.","(Im 52)If you plan on sitting for any length of time in this dress, consider other options.","There is a plastic mesh around the hemline of the inner fabric (the shorter portion of the dress) which is hard and VERY uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time.","I found it very uncomfortable to stay sitting during the ceremony and at dinner at the reception.","OTHERWISE, if you dont plan on sitting much, this was a great rental!"
"6.0","This dress runs a bit large and if youre short like me, it will swallow you.","Its a beautiful print and the sequins were a surprise, for sure.","It wasnt particularly flattering on me, but it would look great on someone tall and thin (Im neither)."
"6.0","I have rented several dresses from RTR and this one did not wow me.","The material was super thin so it wrinkled very easily by the end of the night it is a wrinkled mess.","Also, the color is pretty blah"
"6.0","Absolutely beautiful, but I had to return for regular length.","I am 58 tall and the dress with 4 heels was still laying on the floor.","The regular length was perfect with 3heels for me."
"6.0","I had such high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately I was unable to wear it to my event....","I ordered this in a 2 and a 4, which usually would work for me in most brands...","I have worn both a size 2 and a size 4 in Badgley Mischka dresses, depending on the style... (honestly, I have put on a couple of extra lbs recently (like, 5) so I knew there might be problems with sizing).","I tried on the 4 first... length was good, fit through the hips and midsection was fine and comfortable, the chest was snug, but not squished... but man... the arms and the shoulders....","SO SMALL!...","and I dont have gigantic arms!","But boy were those sleeves tight.","It was easy to zip up and everything, but I knew if I wore it I would be at least mildly uncomfortable all night... still I debated.","What killed it for me was the zipper in back... it just would not lay flat.","Maybe that was due to sizing issues?...","but I dont think so.","It is an extraordinarily beautiful and well made dress, aside from that issue.","I just cant bring myself to wear something that creates multiple bulges along the length of my back.",":("
"6.0","Maybe the jacket was brand new, but the leather just felt a little too stiff/thick to be comfortable.","It was a nice cut and style though."
"6.0","This top is very pretty and made from a nice material.","I just struggled with it staying in place.","Not ideal for a windy day, just kept blowing all over the place.","It also was not flattering on my thin frame."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","It was my backup style.","The 4P was not available so I rented the 2P.","It was too tight for a wedding.","It may work for a less formal event like a Prom.","I would not recommend it for women with a larger chest unless you can wear a backless bra, as it is not supportive.","I am 5, 120lb, 32D, 28yr old for reference.","The 4P I think would have been a better fit; although my boyfriend liked it!","haha"
"6.0","The Euro sizing is a bit different than the US standards, so while Im a US 2, i was a 6 in this dress and it was kind of small in the shoulders for me.","Its also shorter than it appears in the example photo.","Fabric quality is nice and you can tell its well-made."
"6.0","I ordered this dress as a last-minute exchange and it worked fine for my event- but not the most comfortable dress Ive ever worn.","I had to adjust the bottom every time I stood up (it would ride up).","If you have a curvy bottom, this may not work for you.","The lace, while very pretty, was tight and uncomfortable against my throat.","It did fit well in the bust and waist, didnt have to wear a bra due to the corset-like construction hidden inside the dress.","There is absolutely no give, as is usually the case with lace.","All that being said, I did receive lots of compliments and thought it looked good in pictures.","I liked the defined waistline- it hit at just the right place.","But, would not rent again.","I marked runs small, but would order your normal size, and size up for your second size."
"6.0","Cute, but I prefer a higher waste.","Had to pull my pants up a lot."
"6.0","Rented this dress to go out to dinner with my husband for our 3 year anniversary.","It looked amazing but ran small.","I normally wear a 2 and had to go up to the 4 with this one and when I would sit the black band in the middle would cut into me stomach just a bit.","The other down side is I am pretty short so even in 5in heals the back was hitting the floor a bit.","I still loved the dress and thought it looked amazing!"
"6.0","I didnt actually end up wearing this.","I rented it to possibly wear to work, but like the other reviews, its so thick.","It really is the neoprene wet-suit material which is way too thick.","I love the design, but would not recommend."
"6.0","Overall fit was tight across shoulders and back and sleeves were short.","I just filled up the cuffs and it was fine.","Nice soft leather."
"6.0","I read the other reviews before I decided to rent this dress.","I knew that people said it makes sensitive skin really itchy.","I never consider my skin sensitive so decided to give it a try.","It is a really pretty dress; however, the itchy issue is much worse than I expected.","I felt so itchy even if I wore a light inner wear inside this dress.","The fabric is really thick and with this kind of fabric and seams, it really should have a lining and unfortunately it does not.","Pretty but definitely wont wear it again."
"6.0","Dress runs true to size, 4 was a good fit.","Wasnt great on me, kind of just hung without flattering.","I have a friend who rented this dress last year and it looked fab on her so I guess it just depends!","Nice print and high end fabric."
"6.0","I couldnt tell from the pictures that this dress is still quite fitted below the waistline before it flares out-- as a result, it felt a little tight in the hips (for a girl with hips, like me).","The background color is also more off-white than it looks in the pictures.","The fabric is a nice: thick and kind of linen-ish."
"6.0","I very much liked the dress, but the fit on the top was off.","I always wear a size 8, I have a midsize bust.","The dress fit very well around my stomach, but then the straps in the back were so loose.","Otherwise, very comfortable and fun dress."
"6.0","Order one size smaller than usual - a 2 fit perfectly, although Im usually a 4.","Sleeves were a little short and had zippers, which I wasnt aware of.","Dress is fully lined and falls nicely."
"6.0","I love this dress, but I could not fit into the xsmall.","Not even close.","If I was going to try again I would get a medium, thats how far off it was.","This is great for truly very petite women.","It really was a beautiful silk and great silhouette!"
"6.0","Dress was great color and really stood out - especially with the great shoulder detailing.","I was happy with the quality; the fabric was nice and thick.","That said, the fit was very odd.","First of all, it definitely fits large (I wore 1 size smaller than usual and it was still loose in waist).","Secondly, it is definitely made for someone who is either apple or straight up and down.","The 4 was tight in the boobs and shoulders, but I was swimming in it around the waist and butt.","Lastly, the dress is really short.","I am 52 and it was almost too short for me in 3-4 inch heels.","My shoes were definitely showing.","If youre any taller and are planning to wear heels - try the long length!"
"6.0","The color of this dress if bright and very bold.","For sure a neon color dress.","I didnt love the location of the cut outs, I thought they would be closer to my waist line.","The cut outs were located at the widest part of my ribs."
"6.0","Tried it on and fit perfectly."
"6.0","When the dress arrived my first rection was, this looks like an ice dancer costume.","I was suprised when all of the reviews raved of the fabric, because I found the blend to be dated.","After rolling up the too long of sleeves, and doing my hair and maikeup (not pictured) I felt the dress looked nice.","I wore it to an event ouside on a chilly night, and I highly recommed if for a cool evening.","Overall, if I saw this in the store I wouldnt pick it up, let alone purchase."
"6.0","I read the reviews and knew I was taking a risk when i rented this, but took the chance anyway.","It was huge.","I was swimming in it.","Its a shift dress, so it didnt look right belted and the material is too thick for it anyway.","Sadly there was no way to make this work since I already ordered the zero.","Very cute dress, just wish it fit."
"6.0","I liked the dress and it served its purpose, but I wasnt crazy about it.","I am an event planner so I was working at a black-tie wedding.","When youre working, you dont really care about how you look.","I was dressed appropriately for the formality and thats what matters.","It is tight under the boob area.","For a smaller busted woman, it can be worn without a bra.","But, for me, I cant go without a bra in a gown like this.","I wouldnt rent again, but it was a nice gown."
"6.0","I rented this dress for a date night and really enjoyed wearing it.","It is a bright color blue and was very comfortable to wear.","It was very baggy on the top which is why I gave it three stars.","I probably could have gone down another size.","Overall, I would recommend this dress if you are looking for something fun to wear, but I would size down for your backup dress."
"6.0","nothing really special about this dress."
"6.0","Overall the dress fit the bill as I was invited last minute to the Ballet Ball and as I hadnt gone to the event before, I didnt want anything too over the top.","The simple streamlined Calvin Klein esque nature of this dress appealed to me.","I ordered both a size 4R & 6R; I wish I had ordered a 2R instead as overall the dress seemed a bit looser than I expected.","Also, the dress was more of a true dark navy instead of the more royal blue color shown in the image, which made the dress feel a bit more blah.","Overall, I would wear this dress again if I ordered it in a smaller size and had the proper amount of bling to contrast the very quiet nature of the dress.","One last note, I remember the dress feeling a tad short with the 4 inch heels I wore that night, and I am roughly 57."
"6.0","I saw the combination of the red dress and green jewels and fell in love with the dress online.","Everything was wonderful about this dress EXCEPT that the plastic boning is coming out of the bodice, probably from multiple uses/normal wear and tear.","Im sure this could vary dress to dress, but for me it was a very painful experience!","I looked great but had puncture wounds when I took the dress off that night.","RTR employees please quality check this!","!"
"6.0","This dress is very pretty and the fabric seems very high quality.","The reason I only gave it three stars is that the fit on my body was off - it was fitted like a sheath dress, but the lower-half (around the hips) was too wide and baggy.","It was also about an inch or so longer on me than I would have liked [hit just below the knee instead of at the knee].","But if I owned this dress and could alter it, I can see how it could be a 5-star, really beautiful classy dress."
"6.0","This dress was sexy, but a little too risqué for my large cup size."
"6.0","Very adorable sweater - pink is lovely and the cut is nice (can also wear sort of off the shoulder if you wanted).","Got tons of compliments, and was very roomy with very long sleeves (but fit nicely even under a leather jacket).","My only complaint was that it was pretty itchy with nothing underneath, and it shed a lot (esp.","bc I was wearing it with black jeans) - otherwise would have given it five stars."
"6.0","Runs small, super cute design though"
"6.0","I didnt feel comfortable wearing this for a date.","The material is very comfortable, light, breathable cotton.","Good for a casual BBQ-type event or a brunch with friends."
"6.0","The dress pulls in just below the waist (Im 56 with a loser torso), which made the top a little sac like and matronly.","Beautiful dress, just wasnt the right fit for me."
"6.0","Definitely on the slightly smaller size.","Im usually a 6 in dresses but this one only the 8 was available for Unlimited so I went with that and it actually fit well in the waist but was too big up top so I ended up going with another dress.","Im fairly flat chested so not all that surprising.","Wanted to write the review because the long was finally long enough for me (6) to wear with 3.5 heels and still actually look like a full length dress!","If not for the too big top this one definitely would have been a winner."
"6.0","Wish i had ordered a size down....the 6 fit fine, but the 4 wouldve been a cuter more fitted look."
"6.0","This dress was beautiful, but Im 58 and even the 8L was a bit too short, it barely touched the ground with no shoes on.","I also found the straps to be too tight.","I didnt end up wearing it, but if I had, I would have had to tuck the straps in and wear it strapless."
"6.0","Unfortunately, the dress was very uncomfortable.","I had rented the black version of it for a wedding the year prior and didnt have the same issue.","This green dress has this strange corset in it with boning.","It makes it SO uncomfortable.","I could barely breathe in the dress!","It was too bad because the dress was gorgeous.","I wouldnt order this dress again."
"6.0","This was a good dress, but unfortunately not my favorite from RTR.","The material is almost like a scuba suit, and it hugs very close, so watch out for underwear / bra lines.","The blue embroidery was super bright, and was my favorite part of the dress."
"6.0","Size up!","I definitely could have gone up one more size however I do think that this dress is tight because of the way its made.","I think no matter what size you get, its going to be restricting especially the arm thingys.","I had them off the entire night other than for pictures and at cocktail hour."
"6.0","The top was nicely fitted - no gapping - and the full skirt is really fun.","Pockets are a nice bonus!","Toward the end of the night, the transition hem between the top and the skirt got quite tight (probably a nod to the catering at the wedding venue!)","but I wasnt expecting that.","It was also quite short in the back -- be careful if/when bending over.","Overall, it was a fun dress but not one I am desperate to own."
"6.0","This dress runs incredibly large.","Im usually an XS/size 0, and after reading other reviews about this running large, stuck with XS for a maternity photoshoot (7 months pregnant).","It was still way too big (in all aspects, but especially the waistband).","There were large holes in the back of the waistband where clearly every past renter used safety pins to tighten the fit.","But even trying that hack, the flowy style and loose fit elsewhere still hid my pregnancy.","Not useful for a maternity photoshoot, but perhaps great if youre looking for a very forgiving dress.","At 55, this dress hit mid-calf, which wasnt flattering for my height.","I wouldve needed to be at least a couple inches taller for the length to resemble the photo, and heels are a must."
"6.0","This dress is pretty and of a nice quality, but I think you really need to be slender with a long torso to wear it well.","Im an hourglass figure, and as a result, the waist of the dress, which I believe is supposed to be dropped, sat right at my natural waist.","This would have been fine, except that it made the top of the dress very ill fitting - much too long in the shoulders and baggy all around.","Since I have a larger chest, I sized up (Im between a 6 and an 8).","While a 6 might have had a bit less gaping fabric at the top, I doubt it would have fixed the fit issues.","Its just not the right dress for my body type."
"6.0","Cute dress, thick linen material.","I have a large chest and I found the dress to be a little unflattering on the top and a little tight in the midsection.","The material has NO give so would suggest sizing up.","It was also difficult to find a bra that didnt show, the arm holes are very big."
"6.0","I paired this dress with a navy blazer for work at my conservative office.","The dress is stylish and looked very polished.","It is a little on the snug side with not very much give in the fabric, so if you are self-conscious about a tummy this may not be the best dress for you."
"6.0","I loved the feminine look of this on the model but ended up not wearing this one as it was quite a bit puffier and prince-like in person.","If you are going for something very girly, almost poodle skirt flirty this is a great pick but if you are on the fence about how frilly this is you may want to pass as it is certainly more so in person.","The material was lovely and the piece was very high quality."
"6.0","THIS IS NOT A SITTING DRESS -- I REPEAT, NOT A SITTING DRESS!","Lol.","This dress is gorgeous and it fit perfectly.","I am normally a 4 or 6, but I read that it runs small, so I got a 6 and an 8.","The 8 fit perfect, but you seriously cant sit down without the dress coming up.","Its not the size that is the issue.","Its the material.","Its thick and has ZERO stretch.","Still gorgeous, but I wont be renting this one again."
"6.0","Listen to the other reviews- it runs big!!","I know it can be scary to only order smaller sizes but I am a usually 4/6 and I ordered the 2/4 and wore the 2.","I also ended up pinning the hem up an inch because I wasnt thrilled with the length- the shorter length was more flattering.","Tight on hips/upper thighs, so think twice if you are body-conscious in these areas.","Plenty of room in the bust, even in the 2.","It was fun and shiny, good for a cocktail party or night out.","Got plenty of compliments, but personally it wasnt my favorite rental ever."
"6.0","I wore this for a summer wedding and got tons of compliments.","The color is fantastic and I love the pockets on the dress!","Overall, the dress is super comfortable but its a tad bit snug around the waist band but manageable.","I would definitely rent this dress again for another occasion."
"6.0","The top part of this dress was too big (and Im top heavy).","Would recommend sizing down."
"6.0",":)"
"6.0","Less dressy than appears in photo.","Good for a stunning day dress."
"6.0","This dress was beautiful but did not flatter me.","I am normal weight and height but with a bigger bust.","The dress just did not lay right on top in either size.","Even with the use of the fashion tape, it just was too much."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress as the bodice and skirt ended up way too high on my body to be that flattering.","If you are tall, or have a longer torso, this doesnt work very well.","I could have probably worn the 6 for a more cinched in waist but it would have been tight in the shoulders.","But very cute and pockets are nice!"
"6.0","This is a fabulous shirt that can be dressed up or down.","I love the color and the lightweight feel of the fabric.","The only caveat is that the fabric wrinkles easily.","Also, the length of the short is fairly short, so I wouldnt recommend for people with longer torsos."
"8.0","Cute and summery Equipment silk blouse.","I found that it fit me a little bigger than the other Equipment shirts Ive ordered in size S. The white is pretty sheer, so you need to wear something under it for work.","The fabric wrinkles if you so much as look at it funny, but thats to be expected.","I received lots of compliments, but probably wont rent again due to sheerness/size."
"8.0","Pros:  Extremely flattering and comfortable.","If going to a super-formal affair, take the opportunity to really shine!","This dress does the trick.","Cons:  The size 2 actually fit me, but it was an inch+ longer than the 4.","I didnt want to be lifting it up all night, so I wore the bigger size.","As a small-busted woman, there was too much fabric up top in the 4, so that was my only frustration.","But, it drapes and is tailored/pleated so nicely, that it didnt really look ill-fitting."
"8.0","It definitely ran larger than I expected.","The top fit me well but the sequins scraped my arms a little bit when I was dancing at my formal.","Otherwise it was a great dress and I got a ton of compliments!"
"8.0","I got a 2 and a 4.","The 4 was hanging off me and I probably should have gone down to a 0.","It was way to loose up top.","The straps would occasionally fall down and I was surprised I didnt indadvertedly flash anyone that night.","Not meant for a small busted, short torso-ed girl like me.","But so sparkly that I couldnt not wear it."
"8.0","I wore this 2 weeks post baby and felt great!","Got so many compliments!","Fit was perfect."
"8.0","Perfect fit for me, I have a full chest but narrow ribcage.","It was really flattering and did not need a bra, although I did wear stick on cups.","The skirt falls away from the body so it is definitely forgiving if you have curves.","The cut is pretty conservative but it is trendy and fun so I felt comfortable dancing and I got so many compliments.","The only con would be the sequins rub a bit under the arms but not something that would stop me from wanting to own it!","Seriously wish this was a part of my closet."
"8.0","I love the fun pattern and the blue is very pretty.","The dress was not available in 2 petite which probably would have worked a little better.","I am a size 5.4 1/2 and it was very long.","The dress also fits very, very snugly in the waist.","I am usually a size two and sometimes a zero depending on the dress.","Unless you have a very slim waist I would go for a size up.","Dress is beautiful and I fully enjoyed wearing it!","I did wear a black camisole underneath."
"8.0","The dress fit pretty nicely.","I wore a size 6.","I felt like stomach area was a little loose and thick and it didnt hug tightly so it made me feel a little fatter.","The designs on the dress is nice."
"8.0","The sleeves are a little tight but they zip and I kept them unzipped all night.","Comfortable dress to dance in and a great color!"
"8.0","Overall a great versatile dress.","I found it to run large, it is definitely lose fitting which was great for a casual night of dinner and drinks.","Easily could be dressed up or worn to the office.","The color is fantastic!"
"8.0","I ordered this in size 2, 4.","I would have preferred to wear the 4, but the blue color had rubbed off of the sequins in some unfortunate places (namely, the chest), which made it look really awkward.","RTR customer service was great and sent out another style dress, since they didnt have another in the same size, but it wasnt very flattering on.","I managed to fit into the size 2 much more comfortably then I thought possible - the only tight part had nothing to do with my 20 week pregnant belly, and every thing to do with my rib cage.","Fashion tape is a must."
"8.0","Runs true to size.","The straps are not adjustable.","I suggest tape and or pasties if you plan on being out on the dance floor.","I received so many compliments on this dress and would rent this dress again!"
"8.0","Wore this dress for work.","At 58 this can be a little short when I walk but nothing that was scandalous.","It is comfortable, warm and looks work appropriate while not feeling too stiff.","You could also wear with casual shoes and dress down.","I liked this dress a lot.","I am normally a size 8 and the medium was a perfect fit, not tight and not too loose."
"8.0","Pros: Long enough to cover hips and longer torso.","(my torso is proportionate, but I am almost 6 ft. tall so I           need longer things)          The top is large enough for a larger busted woman (I am a 38DD).","The material is dreamy and actually has a nice dark blue intertwined with the black.","You can wear a normal bra underneath and cannot see it.","The lining covers everything and provides decent modesty for work.","Cons: The lace is very delicate, so be careful when youre doing a lot of moving.","The shirt is to die for.","I am a pure hourglass shape, with a small waist, large chest and hips-- and I cant believe it nipped at the waist correctly.","I styled it with cobalt blue crop pants, black studded heels, and a leather jacket!","It definitely runs true to size and even gives a slight amount of wiggle room for those with a little tummy or heavier-set hips.","I got so many compliments on this- I would recommend to anyone."
"8.0","Loved the print, the fit, the color, the neckline -- this is a great dress.","It does have an open back so its a little difficult to figure how to wear it but its so cute.","It was definitely long enough even though Im quite tall.","Definitely will rent again for warmer weather."
"8.0","I typically wear a 4 and hardly need to go up to a 6, but from the reviews I ordered the 6 and the 8.","I am more bottom heavy and needed the 8 and a strapless push-up bra to help me fill out the top part.","Otherwise, the dress is stunning, I received tons of compliments.","Very body-con, so I broke out the spanx, but again, its practically perfect!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to military banquet.","It fit perfectly except for the fact that it was a little long!","The color of this dress is absolutely gorgeous.","It is the perfect combination between classy and sexy!","I highly recommend this dress for a wedding or a forma affair!"
"8.0","I ordered the 6 and 8 in this dress and while the 6 fit fine, the length was pretty short in both the 6 and 8.","I decided to wear the 8 so that there was a little more length in the dress.","It was winter, so I had tights on, but without tights I probably would have been tugging at it all night.","The rest of the dress was very comfortable and fit true to size."
"8.0","I took off one star because I felt like I was being strangled in this dress, but got used to it as the night went on.","It was very cute and a lovely color.","Perfect for a pear shaped body.","I wore it with a chunky necklace and a brown belt."
"8.0","This dress was only available in a small- if there was a medium I might have worn it because it was very tight and pretty tight.","With that said, the material was thick and very comfortable and the lace was beautiful.","I got many compliments and despite the shortness, I was happy that I wore it."
"8.0","I rented this for work and I think it is cute for that.","However, I am between a 2 and a 4 and I rented the XS which was too tight in the waist and hips.","The top was good, so Im hoping if I try again with a S it still fits.","Order up!"
"8.0","I ended up not wearing this dress due to how tight it fit.","I knew I was pushing the XL limit and feared Id spend the night feeling like I was going to rip it or actually rip it.","I fit into it, but I felt the dress was 1. too tight 2. the sleeves were itchy 3. the dress was too short and kept riding up.","Beautiful design and make, but it just wasnt for me."
"8.0","ordered a 4 and 6 ... wore the 4 dress but the 6 slip because the 4 slip was way too short."
"8.0","Pros: Beautiful form fitting dress, looks extremely elegant.","You cant help but smile in it.","Its simple and sexy, but classic and elegant Cons: Im a 34 D, and I tried the dress with and without a bra.","Without a bra fit, but I felt like the dress dragged my breasts down.","So I wore a bra to get more lift.","I actually wore a full spanx outfit underneath that includes the bra cup and comes down past the hips.","The problem with this was that with the bra on, the breast cups for the dress were too small and kept sliding down my bra, which caused the top of my bra to peak out.","Now, it was a black bra, so it kind of matched, but it was a little frustrating as I had to keep pulling the top up to cover my bra.","Also, my boyfriend had to do battle with the zipper.","The dress fit very well, but at the mid back it kept getting stuck, and not in a the dress doesnt fit kind of way, more of a this zipper sucks kind of way.","We did eventually get it zipped(obviously) but it was a real pain.","I know I went into more detail with the con, but I loved this dress and would definitely recommend to others.","I think I would have been better off with an 8 in all honesty, especially for the extra chest space.","I thought that since it was a stretchy material that a smaller size would be better, but in actuality, I thinks since its stretchy you can size up and still get that form fitting look.","Im 55 3/4, and the dress hit the ground in bare feet.","So I think if you want to wear heels definitely go with a long.","I ended up going out and getting a pair of kitten heels so that I could wear some sort of heel, but the dress wouldnt be a high water.","The long would have been better.","And I wish more people would add their measurements, so for reference, mine are 36-29-40"
"8.0","Pros: Comfortable, fit nicely, pretty flattering.","Cons: Fabric bunched up around my stomach a little, the dress pancakes your boobs/you can see your nips through the dress if you arent wearing a bra.","Other notes: The dress runs a little smaller than I thought.","so Im glad I got a 4 as my backup size.","The color of the dress is a little pinker than the photo depicts."
"8.0","This dress was slightly big on me in the bust and hips.","I belted it which helped.","Length was great.","I received many compliments.","Dress was a little haggard and obviously worn many times.","No one noticed for the night time event I wore it to.","Loved the thicker fabric, great for cold weather."
"8.0","the pockets do not hang flat, but it still worked well for me."
"8.0","Fit exact.","Really glamorous and sparkly.","Perfect with nude makeup and a red lip!","One star off only because some of the lace was tattered."
"8.0","Fit well and flowed beautifully."
"8.0","Very pretty dress.","Heavy material with pockets but was flattering despite full skirt.","Great for dancing.","I got a lot of compliments.","It wasnt my original dress--it was my backup as both my original dress and backup dress didnt come on time for the event.","I was happy with the final dress though."
"8.0","This dress fit very well, and I think true to size.","The high neckline makes it conservative, while the cutout in the center and slit in the middle makes it a little bit sexy.","I do have to wear a traditional bra, due to my bust size, and it was possible, but I did have to try a few to make sure it didnt show-- just make sure you dont plan on wearing a bra that comes down too much below the cups or in the center.","Its a beautiful color, and I got a ton of compliments on it!"
"8.0","So glad I ordered the 12L as a back up because that is what I ended up wearing.","It was a big loose, but not so much that it looked bad.","I had too many issues with the infamous zipper of the 10L, so I just went with the 12L instead.","The dress was the perfect length and I was able to wear my regular bra using one of those bra clips, which was a HUGE bonus!","Extremely comfortable and flowy.","I am simply giving it 4 stars because you can already tell the dress is getting really worn.","Dont blame anyone, it is a gorgeous dress!"
"8.0","The overall fit was great.","It was a little short, and would ride up easily.","Other than that it fit great!"
"8.0","The dress was a great length.","Definitely size up.","I usually wear a 6 and the 8 wasnt any too big!","The material was high-quality.","The zipper detail in the back was a nice finishing touch."
"8.0","i am between a 10 and 12, and got the 10, which was too small.","particularly not forgiving in the belly area.","a 12 would probably have been better, but might not have fit elsewhere.","otherwise, beautiful dress."
"8.0","Definitely runs large, even the size 2 was slightly big on me, and I normally am a 4.","The material is nice and flowy and doesnt wrinkle too much.","Length is a little long on petite gals, comes down past the knee, but if you tie the waist tighter you can bring up above the knee."
"8.0","fit small in the arms"
"8.0","I didnt love the print of this dress in person.","Just wasnt me"
"8.0","I loved this dress!","The twirl factor alone made me love it.","The color is the perfect pale yellow.","The only thing is the straps had to be tapped up because they kept slipping.","The top definitely has some room for someone with a larger chest.","I did not wear a bra due to the neckline which probably didnt help.","But overall, I enjoyed this dress and received many compliments.","I would definitely rent this again."
"8.0","I wore this to my friends wedding.","I was actually supposed to receive a different dress but at the last minute RTR contacted me to tell me that my original order could not be processed.","They ended up picking this dress for me and at first I was skeptical, but it turned out great!","It even looked good with the Kate Spade necklace I had already ordered.","AND, RTR gave me a 50% coupon for my next order for the mishap."
"8.0","This dress and fabric was really beautiful, unfortunately I just wasnt comfortable with the low neckline, as I thought it was a bit too showy.","Really pretty dress though!"
"8.0","Definitely size up if you have a large bust!","The top fit me great everywhere, except I could not button it all the way up (I am a 34D).","I had to leave the top few buttons open, and wear it with a tank underneath.","Other than that, super cute top."
"8.0","This dress runs true to size.","It looks good when you have some curves."
"8.0","I wore it for my bridal shower and it was perfect."
"8.0","The dress fits tight, I recommend renting a size up.","I loved the color and material of the dress."
"8.0","This dress was so fun and comfortable to wear.","It fit true to size and I received a ton of compliments on it."
"8.0","I absolutely loved this dress.","It fit great and was extremely flattering.","I received compliments from multiple people throughout the night and really wish I could have kept this dress in my closet.","The only problem was it was really difficult to zip.","It took a couple people holding the fabric together to get it zipped because of how the zipper is sewn in."
"8.0","I rented this for a work related gala.","I wanted some thing conservative with a touch of sexy.","I was nervous the cut out would be too much but they were pretty modest.","I LOVE the vibrant color and received several compliments.","Im usually a 6 and the 6 fit well.","I probably could have squeezed in a 4 but not for a work event.","I have a long torso so there was a little extra material at the waist b/c that where a normal persons hips would be, lol.","Overall I was happy with this rental."
"8.0","I wore it to a mardi gras ball, and it just didnt create the impact I was hoping for, it might have been too conservative.","But it was comfortable and fit well except for on top, which wasnt too big a deal because it was so conservative that nothing was going to fall out.","The dress is a bit worse for wear, but its hard to tell.","Overall not a bad first rental, but not amazing.","The length was really good, I wore 3-4 heels but could have definitely gone lower."
"8.0","This dress was rented for prom.","It looked beautiful.","No spanx needed.","It was elegant, extremely flattering and (best of all) comfortable.","This was our first rental, so we were very nervous.","The dress fit perfectly and my daughter got lots of compliments."
"8.0","This dress fit well and was very flattering.","The sleeves were a bit long."
"8.0","Ordered at 2 and a 4, 2 was still too large in the waist and chest area (straps didnt fit close to body).","Length and fit through legs was great.","More conservative than I was expecting but as this was for a work event, it worked for me."
"8.0","The only con I would say is that the shoulders/sleeves fit a little awkwardly but everything else on the dress was amazing!","The back was to die for and I got so many compliments all night!"
"8.0","A little small and pretty short but still liked it!"
"8.0","I was SO excited for this dress, and especially after reading all of the other reviews.","When I first put it on, I wasnt so sure how I liked it.","It was smaller and shorter than I was expecting.","I will say though that for a larger bust, like mine, this dress was flattering.","Despite my own uncertainty, everyone else seemed to love this dress (especially my boyfriend who wanted to know if I could keep it) and I was stopped numerous times throughout the night because of people complimenting me on it.","I will say that as the night wore on, I liked the dress more and more, and it was pretty comfortable and WARM, which was good since it was freezing outside.","This was my first time using RTR and it is definitely a service I will be using again!"
"8.0","The lace on the dress is beautiful, and the color is great and very rich.","Looked great on and got lots of compliments.","Loved the keyhole back"
"8.0","I got this dress as a backup but did not wear it because the 8R was way too big (I am usually in between a 6 and an 8) I got a 6L in a different cape dress which worked perfectly.","This is a gorgeous dress though."
"8.0","A little short.","Couldnt really do the YMCA  but I still felt fab"
"8.0","A bit small on top."
"8.0","Loved the dress, thick lined material makes it very flattering.","The only drawback is that it stretches out a bit, so by the end of the night it became a bit loose on me.","Next time I will  sized down.","Otherwise, compliments all night :)"
"8.0","Was a bit more form-fitting through the hips than I expected - I had to wear Spanx under so it would look smooth.","Also, Im a 34D, and it was a bit low in the chest (should have planned ahead and brought a safety pin).","Was very pretty though and got lots of compliments!"
"8.0","Beautiful dress.","I typically wear size 6 because I am busty.","I ordered 6R and back up 4R; I ended up wearing 4R, which fit me more.","This dress chest area kinda bigger compared to typical size 6, so I recommend order one smaller size than your typical size especially for small chested ladies.","I am 58 and wore 3 inches heels and 6R just covered the pumps; so if you are similar height as mine and want to wear very high heels, I recommend to order L. Biggest con was the zipper, I think it is because of the design of the dress or whatever the reason, it was extremely hard to zip it up.","If you someone can zip it for you.","no problem I guess :-P One more thing, the red color was brighter than I thought."
"8.0","I am 27 weeks pregnant.","I am usually a size 4 (pre-preg) and needed to size up to an 8 to accommodate the growing bump.","Although it was a little difficult to zip the fabric has a lot of give and was very comfortable to wear all night long.","I got a ton of compliments—it was nice to wear a form fitting dress while pregnant."
"8.0","Im 61 and it fit great.","I wore this to two birthday parties and one night out."
"8.0","This dress is perfect for fall...great wine color and thicker material.","Pretty typical kate spade fit.","A little tight in the waist, and the arm holes show your bra a bit.","Wish this dress had pockets, but still a good dress."
"8.0","I wore this to a fundraising gala filled with VIPs and entertainment legends—the dress code was festive cocktail.","As I had to work the entire night (yet still be able to mingle and fit in with the guests), this dress was the perfect choice.","The blue is actually more vibrant/blue in person.","The pockets were amazing—they fit everything I needed for the night, and even with a giant phone in the pocket, you couldnt make out any shapes.","The only reason why I marked it down a star is that you can tell its quite worn—the sleeves/lining were ripped on the inside, so it didnt line up the sleeves that well.","Also, there is absolutely no give—its not stretchy, but thats OK if you order the right size!"
"8.0","I normally wear an 8 (Long, if thats an option - tall girl problems) and I have somewhere in between an hourglass and pear shape.","My waist has always been smaller and is never a problem for dresses.","However, the waist of the 8L was very snug and had no stretch whatsoever so I had to size up to the 10L (thank God I picked a size up as my backup!).","The boob-area on the size up was a little too big for me but it was nothing that some skillfully placed fashion tape couldnt fix.","The long was actually floor-length, even with 3 inch heels on so anyone who is shorter or planning on wearing strappy flats/small heels should be aware that the long is LONG (which was a relief for me)!","I felt like a goddess in this stunning, coral gown and actually felt like I turned heads at the black-tie wedding I attended.","It was a pop of fun color in a sea of black and navy dresses!","One girl actually came up to me and said that she ALMOST rented this dress for the wedding (thankfully, she picked something else - phew!!)","and that it looked beautiful on me!","Another fun note - the flow-y layer on top was a BLAST to swirl around on the dance floor.","Overall, this was a gorgeous choice and Im so glad I decided to Rent the Runway for the first time!","Will definitely rent again."
"8.0","The dress was perfect for an outdoor summer wedding - the color popped among lots of pink dresses and the smaller size was loose enough to be cool in the sun but the sleeves meant I didnt need a jacket when the temps dropped later in the night.","The length was perfect so that I felt comfortable gettin low on the dance floor, but short enough to show off a little leg."
"8.0","This dress is very flattering as I have a lower gut from a c-section pregnancy, a big booty and big boobs.","It was kind of tight in the booty area, more so that I would have liked.","That is the reason I gave this dress a 4 instead of a 5.","The cleavage cut is very attractive.","Although, I did the closure together a little bit to hide some of it.","Overall, nice rental!"
"8.0","LOVED this dress!","Very tight, but still comfortable and flattering.","Wore the backup size (1 size larger), and was very happy with it.","Definitely recommend ordering up!"
"8.0","short wasted"
"8.0","I typically wear a size 6 or 8 depending on the style of the dress, and since the dress looked more form fitting I ordered an 8 (with the size 6 not available).","The material of the dress has a lot of stretch to it and since the fabric is a little thicker, I definitely could have worn a 6 without it looking too tight.","This dress was perfect for a family wedding, not too revealing even with the slit on the leg and the cutout on top.","The cutout in the dress was low enough that I could still wear a normal bra, which was also a huge plus.","Definitely would recommend!"
"8.0","Ok, I LOVED this dress!","It is perfect for a summer wedding in terms of color and design.","Though I imagine the lace overlay and the layers of the actual dress might be a tad bit warm for an outdoor wedding.","The color is spectacular and is brighter than what I thought (which was a bonus to me as I love bright colors...especially pink!).","I will say what most everyone else says, the dress is short.","I wore the 12 and debated if I should say if the dress was true to size or too small.","Just to explain: I could fit the 10 with ease - everything zipped up, the cut of the dress worked with my body - but the dress was so short that I opted for the larger size just to gain an extra inch.","If you have any hips or a booty, it will be even shorter.","So yes, GREAT dress but if youre subconscious about length, either go larger or maybe reconsider."
"8.0","It photographed really well!"
"8.0","This is a beautiful dress.","I was sent a brand new version (tags still on) and it fit very well.","Needed a padded bra to make the top fit perfectly, but otherwise it ran very true to size.","Comfortable and fun!"
"8.0","The big con I noticed was that the sleeves run a bit small.","It was like wearing Spanx for your arms!"
"8.0","It is a very pretty dress that will slim you down, but it does run very small, at least 2-3 sizes small and the legs are tight, you cant take wide strides.","For comparison, I am normally a size 8 and the size 10 JUST fit.","I was scared I was going to rip it a few times but it did stretch a little after I wore it for a bit.","And I loved the way it looked."
"8.0","Great dress, the 6R was a little too big in the chest, waist and length, 6P might have been a better fit for me but the 4R worked out great for my size and build."
"8.0","I didnt end up wearing this but the fit was very forgiving and worked well with a larger chest.","(Note that this dress is not fitted nor does it show curves) Dress has pockets, which I love.","Dress looked very expensive and would be good for more of a black tie event."
"8.0","Fit- nicely, except for breast area.","Im a 34B and it seemed a little loose.","I used a backless strapless nude bra which kept peeking out in the front through the lace, which kept me very busy throughout the wedding.","The lace throughout the dress looks very worn."
"8.0","The dress was a little snug on me, but with spanx it worked well.","I typically wear a size 16 so Id say it runs pretty true to size, maybe a tad bit small like most dresses.","This dress is gorgeous and was perfect for my company holiday party with a rock star glam theme.","It has more of a sparkle to it in person that the photos dont really show so if youre looking for some shimmer and shine without going sequins, this is your dress!","I am 5 6 which is pretty average and the R dress fell a little short of the floor so I had to wear flats (which I wasnt upset about at all) so if you plan on wearing heels, Id definitely go with the Long option.","The inside liner to the short part of the dress showed a little bit when I sat down and it wasnt super comfortable to sit in, but not a huge deal for me as I spent most of the night standing or dancing anyways.","The fabric is pretty thick (I wouldnt recommend in the summer), which made the zipper pretty hard to get up, but again, no biggie as long as you have someone helping you get in and out of the dress.","Overall, I was very pleased, felt very glamorous and received tons of compliments all night long!"
"8.0","I rented this dress for NYE dinner.","Based on reviews I ordered the 6 and the 8.","(for reference 56, 135lbs, 36D) I normally wear a 6, but decided to wear the 8 so I wouldnt be uncomfortable during dinner.","The dress is very fitted but somewhat roomy up top.","May be an awkward fit for anyone with a smaller chest.","I received a lot of compliments, but probably wouldnt rent again."
"8.0","I got tons of compliments on this dress!","I am very busty, but did not need to wear a bra with it, because of the built in bra.","However, the boning in the sides dug into my ribs all night and made it uncomfortable to wear.","Otherwise, I felt like a million bucks in it!"
"8.0","This runs huge.","I am 4.5 months pregnant and have gained at least 10 lbs.","This fit me great, but would be huge on anyone who typically wears a 0.","I would say it runs about 2 sizes big."
"8.0","This wasnt the original dress I rented, it was the back up.","It fit better though, so I wore it instead.","The fabric was thick and the cut was flattering.","It worked out well for the party we attended."
"8.0","Wonderful material."
"8.0","I wear a 32 B and felt like the top was a little large.","Also for the height was perfect with a heel."
"8.0","I really hoped this would fit but I have a long torso for my height and found it was too short in that respect.","I have had problems with other jumpers for the same reason so I was not entirely surprised.","I probably could have made it work except since it was strapless it was being pulled down and wouldnt stay up.","I wouldnt recommend this for anyone who has a slightly longer than average torso and/or small bust that wont hold up the jumper at the top."
"8.0","This dress was a backup that I did not wear.","It was very sexy because it was lower cut and tight.","It is a very pretty dress but I would mention that the fabric is VERY thick which would be nicer for an event that is not in the summer."
"8.0","I ended up wearing the 8L but a Regular length would have been fine for my 57 height.","The Long was almost too long - I had to wear my heels the whole night or else Id trip over the dress.","The wrinkles were very difficult to steam out of the dress but it still looked beautiful and I received many compliments at the wedding.","I highly recommend this dress - its stunning for a formal event!"
"8.0","Great jacket that garnered several compliments from total strangers.","Especially love the contrasting fabric.","Comfortable enough to wear all night; warm, but not too warm (fur is fake).","I do think it runs a bit big in size, but also the style is simply not fitted -- my shoulders looked huge in it, but I think that works with (faux) fur."
"8.0","I got this to wear on a winery trip.","Super casual and comfy, although it definitely needs a belt or something around the waist to tie the look together.","Thanks to the other reviewers for the idea!"
"8.0","Everyday Dress Nothing More nothing less...Tried on and will wear tomorrow"
"8.0","This dress was really difficult to get on and get situated but one on, it was beautiful!","I had tons of compliments on how great it was!","I ended up going with the larger backup size because it was comfortable.","The smaller may have worked once it was on but it didnt think I would be able to get it on correctly!"
"8.0","I rented this dress in a size 4, which is the size I usually wear, and it fit well.","It accentuated my waist and wasnt tight on my stomach, which I really liked.","The zipper was a bit difficult, but I was able to zip myself into and out of the dress so it wasnt too bad.","Overall, I was very happy with this rental."
"8.0","Not sure if this was just the particular dress I rented, but the hips were quite stretched out and created a slightly weird bulge on the side.","Other than that, I loved the color and the fit, and would definitely rent again."
"8.0","I wore this jumper for a party my company was hosting and I was working at.","It was the perfect mix of fun and professional - I got tons of compliments and was happy to have something to wear that wasnt the standard LBD.","My only complaint was that the pleating in the front of the pants can be slightly baggy and thus unflattering at certain angles.","But overall I loved this and would definitely rent again."
"8.0","This sweater is so cozy and perfect for chilly fall/winter days.","I loved wearing it and the fit was actually flattering despite its chunky knit.","Im extremely sensitive to wool and it really didnt bother my skin at all which was great."
"8.0","Im 54 so this was just a little long to be flattering on me.","It fell a few inches above my ankles and ended up seeming like I was playing dress up.","The material was thick and fantastic; I could see it working really nicely in the fall.","It was comfortable and the cut was otherwise very flattering.","If I were taller I wouldve loved this more but it was just a few inches too long."
"8.0","I am petite and it was much longer than I had hoped for."
"8.0","I liked this a lot, but felt like it was a tight fit across the shoulders and chest.","I probably could have sized up, but didnt want it to look too baggy.","Would recommend a large backup size.","Great for brunch or work with a jacket."
"8.0","Fit it very tight but in a flattering way, just make sure you are aware it will be exact so you may want to get a size bigger just in case, the straps in the back pops out a bit so make sure to keep a nice posture.","After that super sexy everyone loved it specially my boyfriend so ladies it is an awesome dress to rent."
"8.0","Beautiful dress.","However, the Rent the Runway tracking label is attached to the outside front of the slip and is quite visible through the dress.","Had to substitute a different slip.","By the way, a black slip makes the colors pop."
"8.0","would recommend this dress for other women with small busts.","As a pear shape, I found this fit to be really comfortable - the fitted top and the flowy skirt made for a fun dress for dancing at a wedding"
"8.0","This dress is so sparkly - it really makes a statement!","I wore it for a singing gig at a private party and got lots of compliments.","I am short (53), so the length was perfect.","It probably would have felt too short if I were any taller."
