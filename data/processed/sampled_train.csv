"10.0","Fits amazing runs a little small.","Im normally a 4R but I had to go with the 6R but that was still very tight.","If youre looking for a sexy tight look 6R is definitely it if youre my size.","On another note this dress is absolutely gorgeous.","I literally received compliments from the moment I walked out of my door to the end of the party.","Definitely a show stopper!","This is the dress you want for that special night!","And shout out to my handsome boyfriend for picking out the dress!"
"10.0","I wore this to a warm, summer wedding and it was perfect!","It is a bit short, and has a tendency to ride up when walking, so behave like a lady while wearing it!",";) But if you love your long legs, I definitely recommend this dress for you!","Great colors; really stands out!"
"10.0","Fit perfectly and true to size - could be worn with or without a bra.","Very classy and feminine.","It is a bit heavy at the bottom but nothing noticeable.","Definitely recommend!"
"10.0","Fits well.","Needs a backless bra."
"10.0","Fit was good and the length was good for me, too.","I felt covered but sexy."
"10.0","This dress is EVERYTHING!!!","I want to own this and be buried in it.","The fabric is luxurious and great for fall or winter, but it is definitley difficult to zip up around the waist and runs a bit small.","I got SO many compliments on this dress.","I was stuck in a walking boot for the wedding and a lot of people didnt even notice because of this gorgeous dress.","Oh and it has pockets... a win all around!"
"10.0","I normally wear a 6 and the 6 fit a little snug in the arms and the chest so I opted for the 8.","It was comfortable and I felt great in it all night."
"10.0","What a unique vest of bringing plaid and leather together.","I personally can’t wait to rent this style for myself.","However, it does run very large so we recommend sizing down for your primary size.","Pair with a black long sleeve and your choice of jeans!"

"10.0","This dress was a big hit with my friends and my husband.","It is sexy without being obvious - perfect for my companys black-tie optional holiday party.","It is somewhat stretchy.","The 8 fit, but I decided to go with the 10 for ease of movement and ability to eat without thinking about it.","The sequins will catch on things, so be aware of what youre near.","You cant wear a regular bra with it, so I got one of the stick on bras that worked great.","Also, if youre thinking of wearing spanx, keep in mind that the mesh panels on the sides come down all the way to your waist, so you have to be aware of where the top of your spanx are or risk showing the waistband.","Overall a great dress and Im so glad that I wore it!"
"10.0","Loved this dress.","I wanted to keep it.","Wore to a formal fundraiser for a local non-profit.","Got tons of compliments.","Fits true to size but I would suggest ordering a size up as the backup.","I ordered the 0 and the 2.","Both fit, but like some of the other reviews mentioned, the waist can be a little tight.","So I wore the 2 to give myself that extra space.","Wore all night in a seated event and felt comfortable and gorgeous."
"10.0","The 4 was a perfect fit.","The dress does ride up so I had to constantly keep pulling it down.","Had I worn the size 6, the dress wouldnt have fit properly.","Other than that, I absolutely loved the dress and received a million compliments.","I would definitely rent another dress from Rent the Runway."

"10.0","I did not want to take this vest off.","So warm and soft!","It was the perfect extra layer to any top."

"10.0","I wore this in Vegas for a bachelorette party, and it was perfect.","I was concerned I would be too warm with the long sleeves, but everything is so air conditioned that it worked out!","The dress fit like a glove, and was so comfortable.","Its short, but not obscenely so.","I usually wear a 6 and this was true to size.","Felt like a million bucks all night - would definitely rent again!"

"10.0","Great length and perfect for a casual Friday at work.","Got lots of compliments!"
"10.0","I rented this dress for a formal work event in Las Vegas.","I requested an 18 with 20 as a backup.","I wore the 18, which fit beautifully - snug but not skintight.","The 20 also fit well in the body, but it was too loose in the underarms.","I did have a friend pin the back up a bit because I cant go bra-less, but the draping still looked natural and I got a lot of compliments (even from total strangers in the bar before the event).","The sequins make it surprisingly forgiving of lumps & bumps, despite the snugger fit.","I would absolutely recommend this dress, especially for larger women who are tired of frumpy options.","Fair warning: light reflects off this dress like crazy and I *really* stuck out in a sea of LBDs.","That was fine by me, but if you prefer to blend in, this may not the best choice for you."
"10.0","Fits small in the hips"
"10.0","Wore this jacket to work, it looks professional and structured, even though its really soft and cozy!"

"10.0","The only con was the zipper was very hard to pull up in the back even when the dress was on the hanger.","Small thing though everything else was perfect"
"10.0","Took a gamble on this little number, as it had no reviews when I initially rented it.","I had a baby 5 months ago and things have settled back in different ways than before, so I rented a size up from my norm and a size up from that as a back up.","Im breastfeeding right now, so I had no idea how the ladies would fit into this dress.","The size 8 fit like a dream - the top is so well-structured that while I needed a strapless bra because my boobs have a life of their own right now, I dont know that everyone would.","Its maybe the first strapless dress Ive ever worn that I didnt feel the need to yank up at all - it stayed put all night.","The length is flattering - Im 59 and the dress hit me just a bit shy of tea-length.","Wedding guests went out of their way to tell me how gorgeous the dress was and when they found out it was a rental, suggested I buy it!","The color really popped - its a beautiful marigold color and you could really do any color shoe & accessories with it.","I had planned on a turquoise heel, but at the last minute remembered that much of the wedding would be on grass, so I opted for the gold shoes because they had a thick heel.","The only suggestion Id make to potential renters is to allow some time to iron or steam - the dress irons great, but did wrinkle fairly easily."
"10.0","I am 511 and I was worried the the 12L would be too short with my heels, but they were out of the extra long.","The length of the dress ended up being perfect.","This dress is so chic and flattering I wish I could keep it."

"10.0","Fits really well.","Im curvy, and I love that it was super flattering."
"10.0","I wore the Medium even though it was too big around the chest, but it helped with the shortness,"
"10.0","This was more revealing than I normally wear and at first I felt a little exposed, but once I had it on and was at the Christmas party I rented it for...","I felt like a rock star!","I got a ton of compliments.","The cut was perfect for me being smaller on top with bigger hips.","I think if I had a larger chest I might be more concerned with needing double stick tape, etc since you really cant wear a bra or much of anything under this.","I cant really say anything bad about this...so perfect for the party I attended!","Oh... did I mention it has pockets?"
"10.0","Loved the length of this dress, great material and received many compliments throughout the evening!"
"10.0","This dress does run larger than expected.","Originally I reserved a 8R and 10R but after reading more reviews, I changed my order to the 6R and 8R and ultimately wore the 6R.","I am 55 and wore 3 heels with a platform and I wish the dress was just an 1 longer but it was fine.","I loved this dress and would definitely recommend it to those who dont mind standing out!","I ended up not wearing a bra and using fashion tape which worked well."
"10.0","It is true to size so it will hug your body really tight.","It wont be forgiving if you have some areas you want to hide...","The dress is very beautiful and the lace details is intricate and so pretty.","The green color has a nice pop to it.","I had fun wearing this to the wedding."
"10.0","Pros: Very comfortable and fit in all the right places.","Cons: Heavier material so def more a fall/winter dress."
"10.0","The dress is tight at the waist.","It has pockets!","I usually wear a 0-4.","And I wore a 4 in this.","My backup was a 6, it was too big.","The 4 fit perfect.","Im 52, 112 lb., 32B chest.","A 4 is the biggest I wear, I usually wear a 2.","So Id say, go a size up."
"10.0","great material, fit, and cut"
"10.0","Beautifully cut to flatter legs (especially when worn with heels), but it is sized really generously and I WISH I had chosen the XS instead.","When in doubt, size down!"
"10.0","The ruching is very flattering and forgiving :)  I am 57 and the length was perfect and hit right above my ankles (if you are short, this dress wouldnt be good for you).",".","The dress was so comfortable and has great stretch to it.","I received so many compliments on it as it isnt your standard black dress!","I especially loved the little ruffle at the bottom!","This will definitely be my go to black dress from now on!"
"10.0","I wore this dress for a military ball and loved it.","It is definitely eye catching, so be prepared to get a lot of looks!","There were numerous women (including strangers) who came up to say how beautiful the dress is.","I usually wear a 6 in dresses, but it was too tight in the bust area, even without a bra.","The 8L still fit well, although it did loosen a bit by the end of the night.","The length was good - Im 59 and wore 3 heels.","My toes peeped out in the front, but with the longer train in the back I think it was best to wear at least a little bit of a heel.","I would definitely recommend the dress and want to try RTR again!"
"10.0","The bust and waist were a bit tight, as the material had no stretch, but it still worked."
"10.0","I usually have issues with dresses fitting me perfect around the waist but too small up top.","This dress was perfect.","From the waist down its pretty loose fitting.","I was a few months pregnant when I wore this and had no issues with fit on my belly.","I would recommend if you are trying to hide mid section."

"10.0","Dress fit well.","The neck was a little tight but generally ok.","Length was good with heels."
"10.0","Fits true to size.","Beautiful rose gold color.","The light hits the sequins beautifully.","Have never received so many compliments on a dress before.","Sequins can be a little irritating in the under arm but well worth it.","Would highly recommend this dress!"
"10.0","The dress is a little long, but other wise its a great fit!","I rented the same style in red last year so when I was panicking for a dress I though why not?","!"
"10.0","This outfit is AMAZING.","I have a tough time with sizes at RTR but this fit like a glove!","Its very sexy but respectable/classy at the same time.","I received a ton of compliments!","Only one size was available and I was so happy that it fit!","If the 10R (6R in US) was available I would of liked to of tried it, but it all worked out.","I used double sided tape (a must) on the sides of the top.","Im 38C and with a tape bra and tape on the sides it was perfect.","Im 55 and it was a bit long but it was fine with 3.5 heels.","Very comfortable too!","The material is nice quality - its not light weight but its not heavy either.","It was about 70 degrees that night and I was not over heating at all (and I have to be in AC in the summer)."
"10.0","I didnt end of wearing it because the material was very thick and I was attending an outdoor wedding with 100 degree + heat.","I cant wait to rent it again!","Stunning dress!"
"10.0","I was reluctant to rent this for a September wedding... the color is not one I wear often and I was skeptical to say the least.","But, this ended up being one of my favorite rentals yet.","I received a ton of compliments... while its a unique, quirky look - its rather simple at the same time.","If youre on the fence... rent it.","Size 4 was huge on me and the Size 2 fit great (still slightly big).","It is tighter on the bottom as others have mentioned... which made it difficult to walk up stairs, but I had no problems on the dance floor."
"10.0","Unfortunately couldnt get the size I originally requested but sized up since my heart was set on wearing it.","It was comfortably roomy but definitely required a bra for me personally."
"10.0","Beautiful dress - very elegant.","Overall great fut, but the sleeves do run a little tight."
"10.0","I was 4 months postpartum, back to normal weight but still nursing and not my typical measurements - so this dress was great for fitting over my new 38D chest, making me appear less top heavy, and the rouched detail around the midsection helped me feel more secure.","It is a beautiful dress."
"10.0","Had a minor setback when RTR didnt have my actual size, but they sent my backup which was one size smaller than I usually wear and it ended up working out just fine!","I needed an extra set of hands to get it zipped up over my boobs, but I am top heavy and the fabric relaxed a bit throughout the night.","I ASBOLUTELY recommend sizing down, especially if you dont have a big chest.","The lace was thick and felt durable enough that I didnt have to worry all night about it snagging or tearing.","Such a classic style, I cant say enough good things about this dress!","!"
"10.0","The color is VERY bright in person-but gorgeous.","The fit of the dress was extremely comfy-but like many reviews the arms are definitely made to fit very tight (but it wasnt uncomfortable).","Just dont expect to be dancing with your hands up in the air.","The material is heavy so definitely perfect for a cold weather event.","Overall loved it and served its purpose for a November wedding."
"10.0","Loved the fit and style, really cool patterns.","Wore it out and walked around, only rode up a little bit :)"

"10.0","I LOVE this jacket.","I really didnt want to send it back.","I even tracked it down online for cheaper than RTR is selling it and sent the link to my husband as a Christmas present idea.","It drapes perfectly, is warm, and very flattering.","I wore it everywhere - concerts, work, grocery shopping - and the pockets are large enough to fit my giant phone!"
"10.0","I usually wear a size 8, but the size 6 fit perfectly.","I feel like this is always the case with RTR, which of course makes me feel awesome ha!","The 6L was probably a bit long, even with heels.","The lace had come undone and strings were lose in a few places, and the boning was sticking out as well.","Nothing too noticeable but the dress has seen its better days.","Didnt stop me from having an amazing event though!"
"10.0","I rented the 2 and 4, but wore the 2 because it is supposed to fit a little snug.","I have a curvy body so I was a little concerned but it fit great.","I probably could have worn either size but I liked the way it looked snug."

"10.0","I wore this to an Inaugural Ball in DC, which is a black tie event.","Ours was held at the National Portrait Gallery.","I ended up finding this dress at the RTR store in Georgetown after my initial choice did not work out.","The dress definitely runs a bit long (to be expected with a R length), but I absolutely loved it!","I could have sized down, but they only had a 4R in the store, so I went with it.","I felt like it still fit really well :)I easily wore a strapless bra with no issues, and the dress itself is really comfortable and easy to move around in.","I got tons of compliments throughout the night.","Id highly recommend!"
"10.0","i wore this to a networking event.","it was perfect.","warm enough that i didnt need the wrap i brought, but cool enough for the day time portion.","i got so so many compliments on this top, i am thinking about keeping it.","also the built in bra is rad."

"10.0","all good"

"10.0","The dress was a perfect fit.","I would not have changed anything about how it fit.","I paired it with a necklace I ordered from RTR.","The pale pink color and lace fabric were very elegant."
"10.0","I rented this dress for a charity event, and it was a huge hit!","I wear a size 4 in my usual clothes, but every bridesmaids/formal dress Ive ordered has always been bigger, so I ordered a size 6 and 8.","I went with the 8 to be a bit more comfortable.","The dress fit perfectly.","Im 50, so I wore 4 in heels with it and it basically hit just above the floor, but easy to walk in, dance in, sit in, etc.","I wish I wouldve bought it!"
"10.0","This dress definitely stands out!","It is so beautiful with the bright colors, love the length, and it is sooo comfortable!","Very flowy and flattering, I absolutely loved it!"
"10.0","I found the photos to be a bit deceiving, so to clarify the colors of this dress are navy, light blue, and maroon.","I found it a bit hard to pair with but ended up wearing it with navy blazer.","A maroon jacket wouldve been perfect.","The dress has pockets, but they hug close to the body so your hips dont look bigger.","Overall, this was a cute dress to wear to work."
"10.0","As other reviewers mentioned, this dress has an oversized fit, but that was exactly the look I was going for.","The color is beautiful, and the cut would likely be flattering on most figures.","The material is semi-sheer and the liner was shorter in length than the dress, so I chose to wear it with leggings and booties.","While the XS dress seemed to fit me too, it seemed to be missing the slip/liner and also had a missing button in the turtleneck section.","Luckily, I was happy with the flowy fit of the small, and it was the perfect dress for date night in celebration of my engagement."

"10.0","Overall the dress is absolutely amazing!","It runs a bit long and even if you arent busty the top will make you look bustier.","I absolutely loved this dress and would highly recommend it to everyone!"
"10.0","Even though this wasnt a petite dress the length of the 0R worked well for me with just moderate heels.","The 2R was too long for me.","The top was very secure with or without a bra.","The slit in the back of the dress made it easy to walk in, too.","I loved this dress!"
"10.0","The dress fit AH-MA-ZING!","It hugged in all of the right places but also had enough give to hide imperfections.","It was a touch long but if i had on taller heels, it would have been just fine.","My heel height was around 3.5.","I was a bit nervous that the sequins would cause some irritation but I didnt even notice them.","The bust was a bit stretched out;  I had to pull it up a few times throughout the evening but not something that couldnt be cured with a padded bra.","Overall-  I absolutely adored the dress and would love to wear it again in the future!!","I received so many compliments and felt super elegant."
"10.0","Great dress, very flattering and fit my height!","Loved this dress and got so many compliments.","Used back up size as the waist was very tight."
"10.0","I ordered the size 4 and size 6, and opted to wear the 6 so I could eat dinner and still breathe ;-) The dress was super comfortable, and very lightweight.","I love how it flowed - someone said I looked like Belle at the ball when the wind caught my skirt and it billowed around me.","I wore medium heels and the dress just touched the ground - I did carry it when I walked so no one stepped on it."
"10.0","The only cons - the dress runs too long.","3.5-4 heels - bare minimum."
"10.0","Perfect dress for a Havana Nights themed party!","Absolutely loved it.","So many compliments!","Fit was basically true to size, maybe a touch on the smaller side...Im usually between 6 and 8, and this 8 was snug.","I was so tempted to just buy this one."

"10.0","LOVED this dress.","It hide anything I needed hidden, but kept me feeling amazing.","I got so many compliments on this dress.","With Rent the Runway dresses I usually order up a size but based on reviews i ordered down.","That was the right move.","This dress has lots of stretch and the size down looked a million times better.","I ended up wearing no bra with the dress and since the material is thicker that worked out great.","Rent this dress!"
"10.0","The fit was true to size.","I did get some minor scratches on my arms from the sequins on the dress."

"10.0","This was my second time renting the dress and I wore it for graduation.","I received so many compliments.","The dress is very unique and the shoulder sleeves are a great touch.","Plus, the dress has pockets!","I do have to comment on the size though because it seems a bit wonky.","Initially I ordered a size 4 (my usual) and a size 6 (I am kind of in between a 4 and a 6 because of my bust) as per a stylists recommendations.","Both were too big and I ended up wearing the 4 but wishing I had gotten a size 2.","The second time I rented the dress I went for size 2 immediately and it fit like a glove.","I would definitely recommend sizing down one or even two sizes from your regular size for this dress."
"10.0","The fit was great and the dress looked great.","Only thing is the V is very low and will show a lot so be prepared for that."

"10.0","I rented this for my stepsons wedding at a Winery.","I was really nervous about taking the risk but I read and appreciated the previous reviews.","Many of the people I work with have used RTR several times before and always had a great experience.","We also rented a BCBG dress for my 21 year old daughter.","I had a back up if I really didnt like it when it arrived but I LOVED it!","I usually wear a 6 or an 8...I was more comfortable and had more breathing room in the 8R...it wasnt too long and I started the night in heals...eventually tossed them for dancing and still was able to not trip over the bottom.","Its a stunning dress and so many people asked me where I had gotten it...so many compliments.","I didnt have to wear a bra...excellent support.","I did get some of the Hollywood double-sided tape for the top floral design to stay up.","That worked for pictures but didnt last when moving around and dancing.","I also took another reviewers advice about static guard for the 3 layers of the dress to keep it down.","That worked great.","I individually sprayed each layer a few hours before getting dressed and a quick spray right before putting it on.","Its a head turning dress!","I am so glad I took the risk and rented this!","!"

"10.0","This dress was perfect.","I am tall (510 1/2, 155 lbs), have a small chest but bigger hips, but also long legs and am thin, and finding full length dresses is HARD.","This dress was AWESOME, though.","I wore the NuBra L398 Feather Lite (got it off of amazon) so I wouldnt look flat chested, and that was easily concealed by this dress and then I was able to show off the details on the back without worry.","It wasnt clear that the dress fit so well until it was all the way zipped up, so when you try it on make sure you do that.","I could have worn the dress with flats, but opted to wear it with 2-3 black wedges; it was amazing that it allowed for both options.","The material is a bit heavy (this was a summer/early fall wedding) so be wary of that with that much beaded fabric on the bottom, but I wasnt overheated.","All in all I would definitely wear this dress again and recommend it to others."
"10.0","I rented this to wear out for cocktails on my birthday.","Very fun outfit and flattering fit!","Love the sequin bodice, and the V line of the back is so lovely.","Only problem was that the zipper was difficult and it actually got too stuck to be able to zip it up fully, but theres a clasp at the top of the zipper so it worked ok.","Regardless, would definitely rent this again."
"10.0","Great fit.","The quality of the material was good.","The dress had structure to it.","You cant go wrong."
"10.0","I read several reviews before renting it myself and its true, the dress has a thicker lining, so it is better for a colder weather!","I normally wear a 0 or 2 in dresses and since I was only ordering one size, I opted for the 2 because I was afraid after reading up that the sleeves might be too tight.","The sleeves were a little tight at first, but once I got my arms situated in the dress it was comfortable and I didnt think about it again the rest of the evening.","The dress fit comfortably, but my one regret was not getting the 0 which would have been an even better fit.","I would HIGHLY recommend this dress!","The lace detailing is absolutely amazing!"

"10.0","I could have probably worn the 4 or the 6, but the 6 was a little baggy/less flattering, and it was significantly longer than the 4 - too long.","So I went with the 4, and it was perfect.","The color is absolutely beautiful in person, and the dress is super flattering.","As others have mentioned, you cant wear a regular bra because of the back, but I found that the top was snug enough so that this was not a problem.","I would totally recommend this dress!"

"10.0","I wore this skirt with the gold top that is pictured on the model.","When I first got the skirt and held it up to me I thought, wow this is really long.","However, the gold top in the picture is VERY short so I pulled the skirt up above my belly button so about 2 inches of skin was showing and it hit my legs mid calf as it does in the picture shown.","Loved this outfit!"

"10.0","I rented an 8P & 6P, the 6P fit well also but the 8P was bigger so it was a little more comfortable.","It was very slimming overall, it was hard to bend in but thats expected with the type of dress.","Im 51 and wore 4inch heels, the dress still touched the ground but didnt seem to drag much.","Im a 34D and wore a strapless bra, it wasnt snug around my chest at all, it was a little big on the sides so i kept looking to make sure my bra was not out (expected since it was a little big on me).","I received many compliments on this dress, and I loved it myself!","I would absolutely rent this dress again!","!"

"10.0","Unfortunately I didnt get a full length photo, but you can somewhat tell from what I do have that this dress is quite fitted to almost the knees -- giving more of a mermaid effect than it shows in the pictures.","It wasnt the *most* comfortable dress Ive worn but it wasnt super uncomfortable either.","I am almost 5 5 and wore 4.25 heels .. the dress was still a bit too long but I prefer longer vs shorter.","Overall a good experience for not being able to have a dress tailored to fit perfectly.","I ordered a 2 and 0 - the 2 fit perfectly, I actually didnt even try on the 0."

"10.0","The details in the dress were the details.","It is even more beautiful in person!"
"10.0","This was my first RTR experience and Ill definitely be back for more.","Unfortunately the lace around the collar was curled under so I had to steam it and then put heavy books on them to flatten it out.","Luckily it arrived early enough for me to have the time to do so.","The beige lining also showed half the time at the bottom of the dress, but that didnt bother me too much.","Other than that - the dress was gorgeous and I received a ton of compliments.","I would definitely rent again."

"10.0","The pros are the print, the pockets, the fullness of dress and the quality.","The cons are the tightness in the ribcage area.","I could have gotten away with the 2L but I wouldnt have been able to breath all night.","I really needed the 4L but it was rented out.","The 6L works with some temporary tacking on the side.","Im on the taller side but the larger size gave me more length so I was able to wear 3 inch heels and still have it hit the floor.","The dress was a big hit-Everyone was coming over to tell me how much they loved the dress.","Way to go RTR!!!!","!"

"10.0","Fit was perfect for someone that is small chested, but has a wider hip/butt area.","I would say double sided tape is a must to make sure you are not exposing yourself all night."
"10.0","I really liked this dress.","I was form fitting with a good bit of stretch; it felt quite flattering and slimming.","I wore it with heels and a cardigan to work and again to lunch with sandals to make it more casual, and it worked well both ways.","I will definitely order this one again and perhaps even buy it the next time."
"10.0","This photo doesnt show the cutout unfortunately but it was tastefully placed and not too dramatic.","The slit doesnt expose too much but it adds just the right amount of interest to the dress.","The fabric is thick and luxe.","I wore a nubra but it looked fine without one as well.","I would suggest going up a size or at least having a backup."
"10.0","Id highly recommend this jumpsuit for small-chested women as it is quite revealing and showy.","It takes a lot to keep everything contained!","But its very comfortable, and the color is very flattering against any skin tone from what I could tell.","I loved it.","Looking to buy it if I can!"
"10.0","I am 54 with broader shoulders and smaller on bottom (2-4).","I generally wear between a 6 and an 8, and it varies.","The 6 was the perfect size for me.","it was fitted on top and loose on the bottom, so I didnt have to worry about my varying measurements."
"10.0","I usually wear a 6 and I got the 8.. it was perfect.","The color really pops and its a flattering fit."
"10.0","Fit very well - the material is forgiving as it has the right amount of support and the style helped to hide my big belly (ruching in the right places).","Needed 3-inch heels.","Material heavier and worked well for fall, rainy evening wedding ceremony (indoors)."
"10.0","This is one of my all time favorite items I have rented to date!","It was so stylish and the cut is very flattering.","Many coats can be boxy, but the princess seams and the belt make this one of the most comfortable and flattering.","I wore this to Toronto on a winter day (25 degrees) and Id say it was not quite warm enough, if I didnt have a thick turtle neck on underneath.","Would rent again without hesitation!"
"10.0","The dress was a replacement dress and I was so pleased with the results.","I am glad that I got this for a work awards ceremony.","I felt perfect in it.","My back up dress - the 4 fit well, but I just felt more comfortable in the 6.","It was the most comfortable dress that I have gotten from Rent the Runway yet!"

"10.0","I love the flow of this dress and the fit was PERFECT.","However, it was SUPER long and I kept stepping on the napkin hem corners.","Still fun to wear."
"10.0","Ruffles Galore!!","This style was so fun and different, it ran true to size and I would reccomend sizing one size down for your backup size.","It is fitted at the bust so I would recommend this style for anyone sizes A-C.","The shape of this dress was not fitted, it was not fitted in the hips and the fabric did not have a lot of stretch.","You can 100% wear it with a regular bra, spans or shape wear would be with ensuring no lines are seen through the fabric, but seamless panties would work as well!","The fabric has some stretch to it, the best body types for this style are Apple, Hourglass, Athletic, Petite, Straight & Narrow.","I would wear this style on a date, an evening work event, or formal brunch.","In the winter I would pair it with dark accessories, grey, black or dark purple.","In the spring I would stick to nude tones, rose gold and cream accessories.","I would also recommend simple jewelry, no major statement pieces as the ruffles are certainly the focal point of this style."
"10.0","This is my third time using RTR and as usual I was not disappointed!","The dress ran a little small but the free extra size made that no problem.","The color is true to the picture online and was the perfect length for a church wedding."
"10.0","I wore this dress to my rehearsal dinner and it was stunning!","I received so many compliments throughout, and the dress itself was comfortable to wear.","The sleeves were a little long on my arms, but other than that, the dress was perfect.","I even ended up changing back into it after our wedding!"

"10.0","This dress was AMAZING!","I usually dont wear halters, but the support and fit were great.","There was ample coverage to avoid side boob or looking stuffed into the dress.","The black on black jacquard was understated, yet beautiful - it made the dress.","It was true to size and was a perfect length.","I got so many compliments on it.","I wore it with red lipstick, simple drop earrings, two bracelets, and black single strap heels - no necklace needed."

"10.0","I loved this dress!","Wore it to my sorority formal and got tons of compliments.","The fabric is stretchy but not totally forgiving.","The slit is very cool but not the most practical dress for walking because of the way the material falls when you are walking any faster than a snails pace.","However, if you want a dress that looks great in pictures and gets you a million compliments, this is for you!","As a tall girl (510), I would recommend getting the long even if you are wearing short heels.","The long was perfect with a 3 heel and my height!"
"10.0","Great!"
"10.0","The pictures are of me in the Medium which I ended up not wearing because it was time to send back, but I loved it even though it was a little loose.","Im almost always a size 6 or Medium.","When I ordered it this time, I wore the Small and it fit perfect but I forgot to take pictures.","I could have worn either one, but the small didnt have any looseness around the waist.","I love this dress even though both times it was wrinkled.","With the pattern, it wasnt obvious and I wore unironed."

"10.0","Great true red color that as another reviewer said, helps you stand out in a sea of LBDs.","The neck felt a little tight sometimes but overall a comfortable dress.","I received many compliments.","I really, really wish RTR had a size zero on the dates I needed the dress.","I wore a 2 and it was fine, but the zero would have been a total home run.","If you are in between sizes, Id suggest going down."

"10.0","I love NIcole Miller dresses and was thrilled with this one for a black tie optional wedding in NYC.","Its comfortable and stretchy.","The dress is actually pretty heavy - I wasnt sure if this would be a slinky dress that shows every bump, but there is a lining and with the stretchiness, makes the dress quite flattering and smoothed out the bumps I am 52 and it is definitely long.","I occasionally stepped on the back of the dress with three inch heels on.","I definitely held the dress in one hand when I put on flats to walk home.","So shorter ladies beware."
"10.0","I needed a dress for a summer wedding and thought this would be great, albeit sexy, but classy for an evening wedding.","Pros: fabric & fit: fabric is lightweight enough to wear in spring/summer & fit is fitted but not tight enough that it would show every roll, underware line etc.","Cons: reviews!","Im a true 2 in designer clothes and everyday wear but because Im pretty straight (boyish w/ minimal hips, but a booty) the 4 looked large on me and make me think it was just a horrible fit--I never tried the 2 as it was unavailable so in a last ditch effort I tried on the 0 and MULTIPLE friends confirmed I finally looked like a dime piece.","This would be a horrible dress for a girl whos very hippy (because the low back will gape, and its short) but for a straight body on bottom, its perfect.","Also, I have more narrow shoulders so the sleeves wouldve been big on me had I gone up a size.","Moral of the story?","TRY CLOTHES ON for FIT!!","!"
"10.0","The dress is flattering without being too revealing - it is short but the slight sleeves and overall fit make it not too revealing.","It does run a bit small, I usually wear a 2 and this was a snug 2, but not uncomfortably so.","I loved the small cap sleeves to make it not overly showy but still really flattering.","I got a spray tan before wearing it so I wouldnt need hose/tights and it made the pink pop more.","A nice sparkle without being too flash dance.","I LOVE this dress.","It actually was an alternate picked by my RTR stylist when my chosen dress became unavailable, and I liked it way more than my original choice!","I would definitely rent this again."
"10.0","I was a little worried whether a 4 would fit me and so I ordered a 6R and 4R and the 4 was perfect!","I wore it to my junior prom and I loved how soft and flowy it was!","It wasnt too flashy and was obviously well made.","You dont need to wear a bra with it, but I wore a push up to fill it out a little more.","The zipper, as other users have mentioned, was a little hard to get up - but nothing unmanageable!","I got it on by myself once and once with a little help from a friend.","It definitely was long- I wore 4 inch heels and it still touched the ground so I might consider getting a 4P next time, but I definitely would rent this dress again!","The dress came with little goodies which was awesome!","I wore a small simple necklace with it but it can definitely stand alone!"
"10.0","Love this dress and would/will rent it again.","Very comfortable, yet chic.","Wore it to a professional awards dinner and dressed it up with pearls.","Perfect to look fabulous and sexy, but not overtly.","Normally wear an 8 or 10.","Ordered 10 and 12 based on comments.","Glad I did.","The hips/stomach were too tight on the 10.","Lovely dress!"
"10.0","Loved the dress!","Got compliments all night.","I had no issues with sleeves falling down, like some reviews complained about, but they stayed up on me just fine.","Extremely comfortable material and was easy to dance in all night"
"10.0","Wore to a black tie affair and received compliments from my fiancés coworkers all night long.","The 2 was snug, but the 4 would have been too big.","Material is thick, some what stretchy.","Great cut for all figures.","Perfect length when wearing 4in heels (normally 52).","At the end of the evening my fiancé said, I am so glad youre going to be my wife.","He is a keeper and so is this gown."
"10.0","I was a little hesitant to order this dress for the Derby since its pretty short and form fitting.","Im SO happy I ended up picking this one.","I usually wear a size 4 - 6 since my thighs and booty are larger than my top.","I ended up wearing the 6 so I had a little more length.","The fabric was thick, and the structured shoulders gave the dress a more formal feel.","I received so many compliments on this dress!"
"10.0","Fits true to size.","White mixed in with the yellow tones down the color.","Received lots of compliments.","Want to buy!"
"10.0","I wore this for my bachelorette party and it was a total hit!","I originally was going to wear another dress but decided to exchange it at the Chicago RTR store and I found this gem.","SO GLAD I did because it was just perfect.","This would never have been something I would think to rent since I dont tend to get such a form fitting dress but this was so forgiving.","The back makes it so you will have to go sans bra or wear a stick on bra (which I did).","I would definitely recommend this dress and will totally rent it again if ever the occasional calls for such a showstopper."
"10.0","I think this dress runs true to size EXCEPT for the bust.","If your backup is larger, it should be perfect if youre busty like me.","Other than that, I received loads of compliments on this.","For all the tall ladies out there, it hits just above the knee which was right on track for the black tie optional theme of this wedding.","The fabric breathes, I had no problems sitting or dancing, and it photographed beautifully.","Sad to see it go!"
"10.0","Just a really great, glamorous dress for a black tie event.","TherRuching is extremely flattering."
"10.0","One thing to note is that the dress runs a bit big, especially in the bust.","I was debating between getting a 4 and 6 and decided to go with the 6.","It was still extremely flattering and looked great despite being just a bit too big.","Also I just lost a bit of weight so that couldve been part of it that I didnt factor in!","The sequins werent irritating at all and I wore it for 8 hours and had a wonderful time.","The color is absolutely beautiful and all my friends loved the dress!","I wore it to a graduate student formal and had a great time.","Would definitely recommend as I could see this being very flattering on varying body types."
"10.0","Perfect fit and playful for this outdoor wedding.","Highly recommend."
"10.0","I wore this to a dinner party.","It is very flattering and so stylish.","The regular was a little long for my 52 height so I had to wear my highest heels.","Great outfit!"
"10.0","It fits like a glove and hugs every curve in the best possible way!","I have no complaints at all, except for it being white and not wanting to spill anything on it.","I think it was a great choice for me because of my hourglass shape.","The lines on it are super flattering.","If youre worried about which size to pick, I recommend sizing down because its stretchy and you want it tight.","And dont plan on wearing spanx under it--it would be too hot and the dress holds you in well enough on its own.","I wish I could keep it!","Ive seen other people commenting about bras showing with it and it being too see through to go braless--I did think this was going to be an issue and bought petals (could see them) just in case, but it turned out that a nude balconette convertible strapless bra I owned was perfect.","The straps on the bra can be placed kind of wide, so it didnt show in the back, and it was low cut enough that the front was fine, except occasional slippage.","Double sided tape would have fixed that issue, if I had any.","Im a 34E, so this was definitely low cut on me.","You just need the right bra.","Balconette (demi all the way across the front, not a plunge bra) with widely placed straps."
"10.0","LOVED this dress!","The colors were so bright and fun, and the cutouts on the side made this dress really stand out.","I rented this for my birthday dinner and got lots of compliments.","The dress ran true to size and fit well.","I didnt even need to wear a bra.","Wish I could own this dress!"
"10.0","I prefer it to be a bit tighter on top, so I wore the 4R instead of the 6R.","That way I didnt have to worry about pulling it up.","The dress is pretty long, but being taller at 59 it was absolutely perfect."
"10.0","I absolutely loved this dress!","It was my first time using Rent the Runway, but it certainly wont be my last!","Off the bat their customer service is awesome because I had an issue when ordering.","They took care my problem right away.","When I got the dress, I was ecstatic.","It fit beautifully!","The built in corset and wide skirt really accentuated my waist.","The texture of the fabric is very cool, almost 3D.","The skirt flares out when I twirl!","All around a great night made better by a great dress!","I give it 6 out of 5!"
"10.0","This dress was stunning and I received so many compliments!","I wore a size 6R and it was a tad tight which I expected it to be because I had gained a few pounds.","However, I was surprised at how tight it was around my ribcage without a bra on  since I am pear shaped and has a small bust.","Im usually 54 and 150lbs.","I wear a 32C cup and a size 6 in jeans.","The height was fine with my 3-4 heels.","Overall, I loved the dress and would 100% order from RTR again!"
"10.0","Super comfortable although I had a serious problem with the zipper.","Aside from that, I was able to wear a regular bra without the straps showing.","Love the cut!"
"10.0","This dress was a little thinner than I was anticipating but I loved the bell sleeves and it flared out which was flattering.","It was a little tight in the waist area which made it bubble a little bit at the top of the zipper inthe back, but not a big deal.","Wore with tights and booties for a cute winter look and received a lot of compliments!"
"10.0","I loved this dress!","It was super comfortable all night even though it was very form fitting.","Walking was a little interesting because the dress is tight even through the knees.","The ruching is super forgiving and the fabric of the dress felt like I was wearing spanx.","I probably should have ordered one size smaller.","The waist/ribcage area was a little loose but again the ruching helped hide that.","The length was a little long for me but you couldnt tell I hiked it up because of the ruching.","The lace is beautiful!","I received so many compliments!","Would highly recommend this gown.","Would look good on any body type!"
"10.0","Soooo comfortable.","The fabric feels like sweatshirt material and the cut doesnt require any special undergarments.","Paired with a long sleeved shirt and flats for day then switched to a blazer and heels for night."
"10.0","The fabric was made of great quality and the color was very pretty for the summer.","I wore this to a pool party/rehearsal dinner the night before a wedding.","I liked that the romper was not formal but not too casual.","It was also very proportional to my petite figure."
"10.0","I wore this dress for my civil wedding ceremony.","As others have said, it definitely runs large; I ended up going with my backup, size 2, since it was slightly more form-fitting.","The RTR notes say that this dress can be worn with standard undergarments, but fabric texture and bra/panty lines definitely show, so keep that in mind.","The dress was comfortable to move around in, and the heavy fabric kept me warm on a cool fall morning.","I wish it were a bit more fitted in the waist, but thats really my only complaint."
"10.0","Cons:  The flower pattern varies by dress.","I am not sure if it is by size or if each dress is unique.","The zipper was a little sticky at about the halfway point.","Pros:  The dress is a very flattering cut.","The hem length was great.","Pockets.","The material is thick and high quality, but didnt get hot in the Louisville sun.","I wore it with a regular bra.","The pattern is very pretty.","I felt comfortable and confident in the dress, even after wearing it for 8 hours in the sun.","I would definitely rent it again."
"10.0","I wore this to my companys Christmas party I normally wear an 8 but the 10 fit better and controlled my top.","I could have benefited from wearing spanx for sure so that would be the only comment I wish I did to smooth things out other than that it was a slimming dress and I received a TON of compliments on it.","Im known as the girl who always RTRs for work parties."
"10.0","I absolutely loved the cut of this dress.","The high neck and length of this dress was so flattering!","My usual dress size is a small and I am wearing a small in the photo.","I do recommend going a size up for curvier women  because the dress only has some stretch and is very fitted.","The dress is fitted throughout the midsection and hips.","This dress would work best for A-C cup sizes.","I am 36D and it was a little tight in the bus area but not very uncomfortable.","This dress can be worn with a standard bra.","I am 5’9 and the dress was knee to tea length on me.","It was a great length and easy to move around in.","This dress would be great for going out or work.","Pair with high heels and minimal jewelry."
"10.0","This was a great dress to wear to a wedding-- not too flashy, but still unique and flattering.","The combination of leopard and floral patterns was especially unique.","It fit me pretty well but was a bit baggy in the bust (not bad enough to not wear it, though).","I think it would fit a C cup the best (Im a B).","Theres no stretch to the dress."
"10.0","Beautiful dress.","The petite size is great for short girls (I am 411).","It was a little off the floor about an inch.","Very fitted and yes I also needed two extra hands to help zip it up."
"10.0","I was in love with this romper and wanted to keep it... like most of the RTR items I rent.","The color was vibrant and eye-catching.","As with most rompers, it is a little short for taller girls, but not so much that it was uncomfortable.","I would rent this again in a heartbeat."
"10.0","I love this dress and have actually rented it a few times now because it just works perfectly.","Im more of a pear shape with a tiny top, so it works perfectly to show off my top, push up the girls and then it flairs perfectly so that it never touches the hips.","I added a chunky gold necklace and it can be dressed up for a formal party or wedding."
"10.0","Im usually a 4, and this fit perfectly.","The backup size, 2, was definitely way too small.","It was comfortable, flattering, and modest.","I dont think its possible for anyone to look bad in this dress."
"10.0","I wore this dress to a fancy NYE party (in below zero temps, hence tights and boots).","I typically wear a size 4, but I had a large meal before this party and couldnt get the 4 zipped, so opted for the 6--glad I sized up though as the 4 would have been pretty snug, the waist is very unforgiving!","Definitely suggest a deep plunge bra as the front is pretty low-cut.","I wore a regular strapless, but wish I had packed my deeper-plunge version so I didnt have to adjust all night.","Loved the color and fabric, very well-made dress.","My only complaint was that this dress was definitely not washed/dry-cleaned after the last person who wore it.","The Body Odor smell in the armpits was seriously nauseating 4 :(  I was traveling all day so didnt have time to wash the dress or get a different one shipped.","I ended up having to douse the armpits with perfume but the BO was still all I could smell all night.","Ive never had that happen with RTR before, and it was a seriously terrible experience as I had not packed any back-up dresses of my own and had no other option.","I emailed support to let them know my dress was dirty.","They sent me a coupon for 50% off my next order, but Id rather just have my money back and cancel my membership."
"10.0","Super cute dress!","Great color."
"10.0","i did not wear this with a bra and it hit around mid-thigh.","it was comfy, but it does ride up when you dance and walk around, but ive found most tight short dresses to have this issue.","i ended up tucking in the cap sleeves because i personally dont like the way capped sleeves look on me and it totally worked!","it did NOT look odd at all so if youre weary of capped sleeves, dont be scared to rent this dress!"
"10.0","The picture doesnt do the dress justice...the top was really pretty!","The fit was perfect, the only problem was that it was too long.","Even if 5 inch heels I kept tripping.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"10.0","I needed help being zipped into and out of the dress, but other than that, it was perfect!"
"10.0","I had just had my son 3 weeks before having to go to the USMC Ball, this dress was very forgiving, I was able to wear a regular bra, no problem!","I felt very comfortable and confident for the first time in a long time!","!"
"10.0","At the time of ordering only the 4 was available so it was pretty tight.","There is a slight stretch to it, but not much so dont count on that.","You can wear a regular strapless bra with no problem and I wore it with Spanx shorts.","The only problem was that due to the tightness and high neckline, when I sat down I got choked a bit!","As they say, pain is beauty...","I received tons of compliments and my boyfriend loved it!"
"10.0","It fit really well.","It is fitted and short -- but not too short.","I am 5 and usually have to hem everything so I was nervous to rent, but this dress was great!"
"10.0","Gorgeous dress!","I got tons of compliments.","The size 4 fit me, but the day of the event I put in the size 6 and didnt even realize it.","I could have worn the 4 and it would have fit great, but the 6 gave me a little extra room and was very comfortable.","Not a stretchy dress at all but very form fitting and flattering."
"10.0","I wore this to a nighttime wedding, and it was just the perfect, fun dress.","Im usually a 6 and this was true to size.","The material is thin enough for summer, and the embroidery detail really gives it that wow factor.","The skirt flares out slightly, just enough to be fun and still flattering.","Its also incredibly comfortable, zips up easily, and you can wear a regular bra with it.","Win-win-win!"
"10.0","I absolutely love this dress and wanted to keep it forever and never take it off, but here are a few things I noticed about it: 1.","The back zipper goes all the way down.","Not really an issue - just a surprise.","2.","Very full skirt.","Twirled in it like a little girl.","Felt like a princess.","Loved it.","3.","I thought it ran a little large, but I have a very small rib cage.","Plenty of room at the bust for fuller breasts, though (Im a D cup).","4.","Can wear a regular bra.","The back is low, but not so low that it would expose your bra.","The shoulder straps are a little wide-set for me, so I had to place my bra carefully - there was nothing to hold the bra straps beneath the shoulder straps.","5.","Long.","The 4 was knee length on me and Im leggy for my height - I have a 35 inseam.","6.","Slightly long in the torso.","Hit me a little below my natural waist - this might be an issue if you are particularly short torsoed.","7.","Zipper will not stay up.","Repeat: Zipper.","Will.","NOT.","Stay.","Up.","It only unzips a little, but that was annoying.","I could hear it unzip, too.","There were no hooks at the top of the zipper, like some dresses, to keep this from happening.","ANNOYING.","8.","Skirt is weird to sit on.","I wore this to a funeral and there was a lot of sitting on some not so comfortable seats.","The skirt made it less comfortable.","This dress is definitely more for standing around and looking fabulous (or dancing!","Yay twirls!)","than for sitting."
"10.0","I had to wear a minimizer bra, if you are chesty either size up or plan accordingly."
"10.0","I have had this one saved for quite a while finally decided to rent it as my birthday dress and this was probably my favorite rental I have done yet!","When we entered the restaurant for my birthday dinner almost everyones head turned in my direction.","Loved this dress so much, that I might be purchasing it!"
"10.0","This dress was a blast to wear... material was high quality and the print was fun and different from anything else Ive worn to a wedding.","The material has just the right amount of stretch, which made it both comfortable and flattering."
"10.0","Fits great for us ladies with big hips!"
"10.0","This dress met and exceeded my expectations.","This was a beautiful piece and I received compliments on it the entire night.","However, do get your proper size or size down because the back cutouts will begin to ride up and not stay flat on your back as they are on the model image or on one of my pictures.","I am typically a 6 but that size was rented out so I got an 8 instead.","It is definitely roomy in there and the zipper is very forgiving.","I would caution that if you do size down, the dress hugs you in your stomach and may accentuate your love(ly) handles.","But on the other hand, or side rather, it hugs your booty very well!","Treat yourself and rent this dress, you wont regret it."
"10.0","I cannot tell you how impressed I am after my first experience with RTR.","This dress was a dream.","My FB page exploded with comments like glamorous, Hollywood, gorgeous, classy, perfect for the occasion.","I dont think Ive ever worn a dress off the rack that fit me better.","I am 5 8.5, and with 3 heels the 4L fit perfectly.","I could have gone to 3 1/2 and it would have been fine.","I am typically a size 4 in formalwear so the fit was right on.","I loved the color.","Its a just a bit more jewel-toned than Kelly green.","It really popped.","I really didnt want to send this dress back.",":)"

"10.0","The dress is meant to be snug.","I wore the medium because I have a larger backside.","Fit perfectly and I received several compliments.","I found the dress to hold me in so I didnt wear Spanx.","I would size up with the back up size.","First rtr experience and I will be back for the next wedding!","Loved this designer and the fabric he chose."

"10.0","I wore this for my interview during a recent pageant.","The material was very thick, in a good way, and it fit perfectly.","No complaints!"
"10.0","Runs a tiny bit on the small size; Im normally a 2-4, but based on the other reviews, I picked a size 6 back-up.","4 ended up fitting fine, but there was no way I would have fit in a size 2.","Looked beautiful!","Very structured, bodice-style dress.","Made it a little more 80s punk with a leather belt, blazer, and fingerless lace gloves.","This is a very cream-colored white.","Used a nubra due to the shear fabric over the shoulders."
"10.0","The dress ran slightly smaller than Im used to.","I went to 10 and usually wear an 8.","The dress is above the knee but not inappropriately short.","Great dress overall!","The green skirt is beautiful!"
"10.0","The dress fit perfectly, and I got so many compliments!"
"10.0","I absolutely loved this dress.","I usually wear a 6 and though the 6L fit perfectly up top it was a little tight on bottom so I went with the 8L.","It was perfect on bottom and a little loose on top (nothing some tape and a few pins couldnt fix).","The material is very flattering and forgiving (I didnt even wear spanx) and surprisingly comfortable.","What I love most is that its a simple silhouette that you can dress up with accessories.","Perfect for a black tie affair or a cocktail party.","The design of the back and the slit is very sexy while the front is a bit more conservative (watch out for sideboob though!",")."
"10.0","I wore this to a dinner + NYE party to ring in 2016.","Its beautifully made and very comfortable.","Although its all sequins, it presents as super elegant.","You will need a bra than you can latch low on your back as the cascade in the back fall right below the usual bra line.","You could also wear a gold tone bra though."
"10.0","It fit perfectly and gave my body a perfect hourglass shape!"
"10.0","Beautiful dress!","A little itchy + snug in the upper torso (arms & neckline), but no big deal."

"10.0","Nice fit and style.","Great choice for a business dinner or event."
"10.0","I cant say enough good things about this dress.","Fit perfectly and is super flattering!","The only thing I would have changed is the slit.","On the model it looked as though it would come up higher on my leg but it barely even showed.","That said, the rest of the dress was so perfect I forgot all about the slit.","Definitely recommended!"
"10.0","The dress is beautiful - But I would be a size 6R instead of an 8R!"
"10.0","This jumpsuit is incredible!","The fit was perfect with the exception of the top being a little too big for me.","I have a small back so the straps were a little long which caused me to keep pulling up.","That said, it was still a hit and an item Id definitely recommend renting if youd like to stand out at a party!"
"10.0","I love this style and it is definitely something that I would look into renting myself.","The cutouts definitely give it an edge.","The fabric does have some stretch to it and I would say it runs true to size.","For curvier women I would suggest sizing up for the backup size!"
"10.0","This dress runs really large so I’d recommend ordering 2 sizes down if you want a body con fit.","I usually wear a 6 or a 4 and I tried this on in a 0 in the Georgetown store and it actually fit it was just kind of skimpy.","I ordered the 2 with the 0 as a backup and the 2 was perfect.","It’s not super short and it’s stretchy so it really felt like a sexy fun party dress without feeling too exposed.","I also rented the Badgley Mischka “Showstopper” earrings and Adrienne Landau “Black Marabou Bolero” to complete the look.","All three pieces were so much fun to wear!"
"10.0","Fit true to size for me.","Floral fabric at bottom is very lavender."

"10.0","My original dress I ordered was in size 0 and 2 but the  person who had the 2 before me damaged it beyond repair.","So RTR was so helpful and over nighted me two sizes in this dress of my choice along with the original size 0 for no extra charge.","The fit is a bit loose in the waist but I think thats just the style.","I got tons of compliments on it.","Also it is semi formal looking so it works for many occasions.","Thank you RTR for my first experience, customer service was awesome!"
"10.0","I wish I owned this dress!","Super comfortable.","The color is the most amazing shade of red (not too bright, not too dull).","The only downside for me was the length, but I am 51 so that wasnt a real surprise.","That being said, super easy to pick up the back of the dress when I was walking.","So many compliments all night long!"

"10.0","Fit: LARGE.","I wore some wedges, and with my 5 1 frame, it barely made it off the floor.","Pros: FLATTERING.","I really think the design of the dress if flattering for women with different shapes.","I am not busty, so one of my concerns was the top being too loose.","I wore a strapless bra, and just made sure I inched up the waistline every now and then.","Cons: NOTHING major, just the overall fit.","However, I absolutely loved the dress.","I am so sad I have to return it, but will probably rent again!"
"10.0","I usually wear a 4...this 4 was a tad tight, but it worked.","Flattering waist placement, great color...a little darker than expected."
"10.0","Mostly completely stunning, but too long for someone 57.","Should have ordered the 4R.","I wore 4-inch heels and still way too long."
"10.0","This dress doesnt do its justice in photos.","Its absolutely gorgeous and elegant in person!!","I attended a military ball in this dress, and it was perfect.","I wore flat sandals with this dress and it was the perfect length.","It hit the floor at the right length (in my opinion).","I thought this dress would be too long knowing that I am petite, but I had to wear flats because of my dates height, and it worked out perfectly!","I would say this dress runs true to size.","Im usually a size 0 in dresses and jeans, and the size 0 in this dress fit perfectly... like a glove!","The nature of the fabric/zipper made it a little difficult to zip up, but as long as you have a friend to help you, youre good!","This dress is EXTREMELY comfortable to be in!","Its lined with a soft material... literally, I felt like I was in a PJ dress, no joke!!","The dress and sequins were in great condition.","I would wear this again in a heartbeat... didnt want to mail it back!","Can I please keep the dress RTR??","Highly recommend!"

"10.0","This dress was so beautiful!","It was very snug, but that was really what I wanted.","The color is awesome.","It is a Barbie pink but not too flashy that it takes away from anyone else, specifically the bride.","The higher neckline was so flattering to both my arms and shoulders, and I am a swimmer, so I have some big shoulders.","The length was just right.","The only part that was a little hard was dancing as it is still tight around the bottom and on your legs, but it doesnt hamper your walking or anything like that."
"10.0","It has darts in the bust area that stood out a bit... this is not made for slim figures on top.","Hugs your curves."
"10.0","Perfect fit.","This shirt is slimming.","The asymmetrical cut is funky enough to feel like it breaks you out of your fashion rut a bit, but the pattern, color, and texture are perfect for the office.","Wore it on a day when I had a bunch of meetings and felt great the whole day."
"10.0","I received so many compliments on this dress!","The dress flows beautifully and the bottom is so pretty both in the front and back.","The dress does fit true to size around the waist but was a little big on the top.","I have a small chest and had to use double stick tape to keep the front down.","The V isnt too deep and for bustier women there is some extra room on top.","The fabric is a little heavy so definitely keep that in mind for the time of year and weather.","The best part is that this dress has pockets!","This is always such a plus, but especially at a wedding or formal affair when you are constantly taking pictures, its easy to just slip your phone into your pocket on the dance floor without having to carry a bag.","Overall loved this dress and felt like a star in it!"
"10.0","This dress is amazing.","It is sheer and adds a little bit of jazz, while being very classy at the same time.","I wore this into many clubs/dinner spots and felt comfortable in each one.","The dress fits well, snug, but well.","It flatters in all of the right places.","Great length."
"10.0","It fits you like a glove and hugs in all the right places.","I love the lace detail on the top and got so many compliments all night.","It definitely runs very short as I am 53 (on a good day) and this fits even with flats since the rouching has a tendency to ride up.","Love love love.","Which there was a rent-to-buy option!"
"10.0","Not the most comfortable but very cute"
"10.0","Extremely flattering and professional for work.","My only problem with it was that the fabric was light so the wrapping would blow in the wind and expose too much on the bottom half.","Overall, great fit and a nice dress for work."
"10.0","This dress was a perfect fit for me!","I was sent the 14 and 16, and the 14 was the best size due to it needing to be slightly fitted across the bust.","I was worried about my bust area and having too much cleavage, so I used a small safety pin to pin it slightly higher to avoid this.","The dress was a great shape, and very flowy from the waist down.","I cant recommend this dress enough to ladies who want to show off their curves and sparkle!"
"10.0","Great shape.","Its a nice mix between preppy and gothy.","I wore it on Halloween and did a Smokey eye and loved the look!"
"10.0","I got so many compliments when I wore this dress!!","It was the perfect weight for a winter holiday party - the fabric is thicker than the image on the model makes it appear, so it kept me warm enough in December.","The sleeves were quite long on me, coming down all the way to my wrists, which I actually preferred to the sleeve length shown on the model.","And the XS was a little baggy in the shoulders/stomach for me, but honestly that was better than skin tight for a work party anyway.","I loved this dress!","!"
"10.0","This dress certainly stood out in a sea of black cocktail dresses, but was still conservative enough for a formal event at our hunt club.","My first choice dress was damaged by the previous client and this was selected for me by the RTR stylists.","The dress over all has substantial weight and hangs beautifully.","I probably could have even gone down to a size 12L, because the weight pulled the nude lining down so the top of my strapless bra showed slightly.","Additionally, be prepared to wear heels, I am 5 9 and the dress was still touching ground in 3 heels.","Despite the hiccup of the original dress not being available, I will never buy another dress for a formal affair."
"10.0","I have on the larger side ribs/lats and it fit perfectly there.","Also a good dress for those smaller in the chest area.","The arms can be a little scratchy but tolerable."
"10.0","This jumpsuit fit perfectly.","It was soooo comfortable and perfect to dance in.","Jumpsuits never fit me because of my small upper body/big butt/short legs situation so Im not sure if it would fit a tall person or someone with a larger chest.","I absolutely loved it though and got compliments all night."
"10.0","I ordered this in the 14, but got the 16 just in case.","14 was a bit snug to zip, so I switched to the 16.","That was a little big, but worked great anyway.","I got tons of compliments and felt absolutely beautiful in it!","It is definitely low cut, but I was looking for that.","I did use the complimentary tape they sent to help keep  the low cut area in control.","I loved the service I received and the dress was in immaculate condition!","I am renting a long gown in two weeks & cant wait for that one!","So glad my friend introduced me to this site!"
"10.0","Wore this to a gala and got a lot of compliments.","Great fit in all the right places without looking too skimpy."

"10.0","Rented for a wedding and this dress fit perfect.","I wore a black bra and even though the straps were visible, it looked like I was wearing a camisole!","There is a lining under the lace in the front that kept falling, however a little fashion tape solved the issue perfectly!","I will totally rent this dress again!"
"10.0","This top is great for work but is slightly cropped as it hits right at the pant waist.","The fabric has little stretch so I recommend sizing up!"
"10.0","I got compliments on the dress all night.","For reference Im 58, 130lbs and wore a size 2 and got a 4 for backup.","the 2 fit perfectly.","I was worried the dress would be a little too short, but it hit right above my knees."

"10.0","The fit is flawless, sort of feels like scuba material.","Thick and form-fitting and stretchy.","The skirt is so cool and graphic -- its really the small details about this dress that take it to the next level."
"10.0","It fit perfect, the neckline was a bit low but even with a smaller chest it looked sexy!"
"10.0","I bought the Small and Medium thinking from other reviews that the small would fit like a glove (I am typically a small).","Wrong!","The small was very short and just a little too tight (did not hug me in a flattering way).","The arms were also a lot tighter on the small and I could not fit my hand through one of the ends of the sleeves.","Loved wearing the medium though.","I also liked the way RTR sent this to me (packaged beautifully).","Overall a home run."
"10.0","No tips - I needed to make no special allowances to be able to just throw it on at the last minute and run out of the door looking great"

"10.0","I was so nervous about finding the right dress for my baby bump (twins) and I knew I was taking a huge risk by renting, but Ive always had such a great experience with RTR that I just took the plunge and went for it.","It helped that I sought advice through chat from one of their stylists.","This dress was perfectly form-fitting, yet stretchy in all the right places.","The length was perfect and I was so comfy all night.","GREAT EXPERIENCE and great dress!","!"
"10.0","This dress fit very well!","Depending on the designer, I usually wear a size 0 or 2.","The fabric hugs your body a little, but stretches some.","I did not have issues with it being too tight in the bust or through the hips.","I would order your usual size and a size up just in case.","Overall the fabric is very light and makes the dress comfortable to wear.","It is easy to move and sit in.","The peplum adds wonderful detail without being too over the top.","This is the perfect dress if you are looking for a fun pattern and something comfortable to wear!"
"10.0","It fit well and looked great on.","The only drawback was the weight of the dress.","It was a little heavy and was warm."
"10.0","The dress fit true to size and was much prettier in person than in photos.","The snug fit up top and flared skirt was flattering, and I received tons of compliments all night.","The only minor issue was that the zipper was a little tricky and kept getting stuck on the lining - so you definitely need an extra hand (or two) to help.","This was my first time using Rent the Runway and I was very impressed by the smoothness of the overall experience."

"10.0","I really liked this cardigan, its a heavier material so can be a jacket for places with a mild winter/fall.","They only had a Large in stock so that is what I rented and it was definitely a little bit too big in the shoulders a Medium would have been much bigger for my frame which is my usual size so I would say it runs true to size."

"10.0","This dress style is not what I typically go for, but was a huge hit!","The top half is stretchy and very comfortable, the bottom half is very forgiving and hides what you may not want shown.","Now, although the top and bottom are flexible, the middle area is true to size.","The pockets are great for holding you phone and lipstick when you need to get on the dance floor.","Im 53 so the hem fell below my knees, but was perfect for the very conservative family members that were in attendance."

"10.0","Clover Canyon dresses are made from neoprene (scuba suit material).","Its very thick and stretchy which makes it very forgiving.","I could have work either the S or the M, they both looked great.","Its also doesnt breath much, so dont wear it anyplace hot.","The dress rode up a bit when I walked so I had to keep pulling it down."

"10.0","I wore the 10P back-up size, and Im glad I had it (12 wouldve been too big in size and length).","10P was perfect -- I wore 2.5 inch heels and the dress was definitely off the floor, but when I switched to flats later in the evening I didnt have to worry about the dress dragging on the ground.","I was working a black-tie event, and it was very comfortable to wear the entire night.","Great dress!"

"10.0","This dress is truly beautiful!","Pictures dont do it justice!","I am typically a size 6 and the 8 was pretty snug...","I also wore the Long, which was perfect but Im only 55 and it barely hit the ground when I was barefoot, add 3-4in heels and you could see almost my whole shoe...","This could have partly been because it was so fitted but I definitely think the Long is more of a standard and the regular may be closer to short!","Ive never had to order long anything but Im glad I had it (my original dress was unavailable and 8L was all that was left to ship  the next day (on 12/24)."
"10.0","This style is a great alternative to the pinstripe suit!","Warm for the fall and winter months.","Loved pairing this with a cute pair of sneakers.","This style is very roomy, however due to lack of stretch in the fabric, I would suggest going up a size as a back up."

"10.0","The dress was oh-so flattering and such a beautiful color.","I wore it to my high school prom and got so many compliments!","I usually wear a four or a six, but I ordered a six and eight because of all of the comments saying the dress runs small.","That was not the case for me at all; in fact, I almost wish I had got the four because the six could have been a little tighter, but the six still fit beautifully.","My only complaint is that I thought being 55 getting a regular length would be fine, but even in my four inch heals, it was a little too long."

"10.0","This may have been my FAVORITE RTR dress thus far.","It was SO comfortable, flattering and quite beautiful.","The fit and shimmer were really lovely.","I am usually a 10 and wore the 12 for this event because the part underneath was a little tight on the 10 - the 12 was a bit big in certain places but not crazy.","Id get this again in a heartbeat!"

"10.0","Thick fabric so its best in cooler weather.","This dress is short and tends to ride up when youre seated."
"10.0","Loved this dress!","There are so many fun ways to accessorize this style.","Best part, the bright holographic print which really made it stand out in a crowd!","I had to size to up as Milly sizes typically run small for my body type.","The size 4 fit perfectly and even had a slimming effect which was a plus!"
"10.0","This dress fit me much like many of the reviews said it would.","Its tight, but in a flattering way (after a nice pair of spanks).","Im on the shorter side (53) and the dress was just above my knees, which was fine because of the sheer elements and tight fit of the dress."

"10.0","This dress is super flattering and comfy.","Got tons of compliments on it!","The pockets are great.","Transitions perfectly from day to evening.","It was a bit more low cut that it appears in the picture so just be aware of that.","It was pretty true to size but perhaps slightly large because I took the size down and it was perfect."

"2.0","It is too short to be appropriate at formal functions with work colleagues."
"2.0","I really wanted this dress to work.","It looked so fabulous on the model, and I needed a statement black dress for a wedding.","Unfortunately what Im assuming the designer hoped would be a little extra fabric to conceal the midsection ended up being an enormous amount of fabric that made the dress too heavy and ended up dragging down the neckline.","If youre going to order this dress, size down.","It runs big, and is very long.","Even with my 5 inch heels, there was too much length for my 56 frame.","I should have ordered the regular, not the long."

"2.0","Oversized and unflattering, couldnt wear."

"2.0","I loved the top of this dress, but the bottom trumpeted out a bit which doesn t show on the model.","This made it feel a little too pagent-y for me, especially with the heavy fabric.","The 8 fit, but the lace on it was bent and didnt lay nicely, so I ended up wearing the 6.","It was a little tight but I didnt have an alternative for the NYE wedding I was going for.","Overall, I wouldnt recommend.","The bottom of the dress ruined it for me."
"2.0","Too small"
"2.0","In dresses, I wear a size 0 or 2 and Id say I have an athletic shape.","This dress has a ton of material on the bottom and it didnt hang well on my small frame.","It looked like I had a black table cloth hung around my waist.","The top of the dress was also a little awkward...","I felt it came up way too high and sat well above my collar bone.","I never even wore the dress; I ended up running over to Macys and buying something to wear instead.","I didnt want to waste the money, but it just looked very unattractive on me.","The back is beautiful though.","I feel that this dress might be best for larger body types and could look really atrractive.","I just wouldnt recommend the dress for a small framed person, it just looks like youre swimming in black fabric."
"2.0","Was way too loose and large for my frame.","I filtered for petite and narrow body type and this was inaccurate.","I didnt end up wearing it to my event."
"2.0","Very sloppy fit.","Would not rent again"
"2.0","Compared to similarly designed dresses that Ive worn before, this dress was unusually long in the torso, pooling in the back while oddly tight around the hips.","Also, the right side of the dress seemed more floppy than the left side and I had to keep putting it in place to stay up/keep from folding over (thats what I did to take the picture, but once I moved it flopped over).","If I tried to pull the dress down to stop the pooling in the back it caused the chest buttons to pop open.","I ended up not being able to wear it for my event and immediately returned it."
"2.0","This runs very small.","I am usually a size 2 and wears XS in most tops, but this one fits like a childs sweater on me.","Not recommend for those with a fuller top."
"2.0","The jumpsuit runs way too small.","Im usually a 4 or a 6.","The bottom of the size 8 was fine, though the length ran a little long.","The top part was suffocating - way too small.","Luckily I have a small bust; otherwise, Im not sure how I would have been able to zip it up successfully.","Also, the zipper is really inconveniently located.","I would need help zipping it up after bathroom breaks.","I ended up not wearing the jumpsuit to my event."
"2.0","The dress is length is short!","I am 55  and should have ordered a long.","The dress should have been floor length with no shoes on...with heels on it looked like the Gala I was attending was going to be flooded.","Very disappointed.","Just order a longer length."
"2.0","I couldnt wear it.","I rented my two usual sizes 2 and 4 and both of them were impossible to get on.","It runs extremely small.","I was very disappointed."
"2.0","I am generally a size 0-2, 115 pounds, 55 & 32DD - this dress wouldnt even go over my hips.","I ordered this dress is S & M and the medium fit better, but was still very snug.","The weirdest issue was that the sleeves were way too long and baggy and disproportionate to the rest of the dress."
"2.0","Its huge and look like a graduation gown on.","The fabric also wrinkles very easily.","Id only recommend it for someone that is 7-9 months pregnant.","Then it might be cute on."
"2.0","Well, first off, let me say I love RTRs service and they have always been great to me...","BUT this dress, what the?","You cannot zip it!","It fit, it was not small, but it would NOT zip!","I was so so so bummed because the other dress I rented was sort of in bad shape so I didnt want to wear it.","I had no time to go out and buy anything else so I was stuck with this dress.","The zipper would not go up no matter what we did.","SO, I had to run out and get a cardigan to put over it.","I ended up having to style it down with a leather belt so the cardigan would look normal.","Also at 5 foot 5 with three inch heels on this dragged on the floor and was hazardous.","I had to pull the dress up anytime I walked.","Super disappointing overall."
"2.0","I wore this dress to a military ball.","The delivery was delayed and when I got the 10L which was my usual size and the 8L which was the backup, they felt the same - too tight.","I emailed RTR at 615 CST when I had gotten and tried on the dress.","Jack was able to overnight me a 12 L which I wore.","It was lovely.","I had noticed that most of the reviews were by women who were much bustier than I. I needed the 12 for my hips and the bust was quite large.","(My alternative dress fit fine in an 8.)","All in all, I hope never to buy another occasion dress, thanks to RTR."
"2.0","Im tall and lean, with a long torso.","This dress was too boxy for me and didnt accentuate my body.","Its a short fit, and I felt uncomfortable to lean over or dance in.","But the  main reason I opted not to wear and went with a different dress was because of the boxy torso and my body type.","I wanted something to compliment my figure in a more flattering cut."
"2.0","I really thought I would love this dress, but didnt.","I am an apple shape for sure, so I guess my body didnt love the dress.","The zipper was so hard to get up that I gave up.","This dress would look best on a smaller busted girl who is super thin.","If you want to accentuate you curves or whittle your waist than this is not the dress for you."
"2.0","This dress is really pretty, but it wasnt so pretty when I put it on.","It made me look really big.","I think this dress is designed for a very slim and tall body type.","I also wouldnt recommend it for someone with a large bust because the front flap just makes the bust look ten times bigger.","I didnt wear this dress."
"2.0","Wonderful dress felt great!!!","A little long but over all great experience!!","!"
"2.0","Im only 52, I ordered the regular length since Im short.","The dress was so short in the front that it came to my ankles, without shoes on.","I didnt end up wearing the dress.","Ive never worn anything labeled long in my life, however I think perhaps if you are interested in the dress and you are short, you must order the Long.","And forget it if you are tall."
"2.0","I absolutely love this dress, but it was so short it was impossible to wear!","Im 56 with a longer torso and standing up straight you could see my butt hanging out the bottom of the dress.","Such a shame because the dress is so cute and fits in every other way."
"2.0","I was too small framed for this to look right."
"2.0","The fit was perfect in the waist and length, but you need to be well endowed to fill-out the chest.","A great going out dress if thats what your aim is...it just wasnt mine!"
"2.0","runs large in the hips.","The material is sort of like neoprene and i would recommend ordering a size smaller than usual if you have smaller hips."
"2.0","This top is MASSIVE!!!!","Seriously.","Its not a cute, oversized big top....its huge!","Like, you cant wear it huge!","I am usually a size 4 (S), but this small sized shirt fit one of my friends who is a size 16!","Size down at least TWO sizes."
"2.0","It was too tight in the arms.","I have a very slight frame and still felt very frumphy."
"2.0","I rented this for seeing a Cirque show in Vegas and it was so unflattering I could not bear to post a pictureIf you are curvy/busty and have a waist--this is NOT the dress for you, the part where it has elastic sack type waistline was far too baggy and made my stomach look huge because it stayed puffed out as large as my chest stood out and then it was skin tight across thighs/butt area and then actually flared out on the end in some odd way--I would have preferred it to just be tight all aroundThat and it was really short, about mid/upper thigh and Im 54 so if you rent, definitely think about tights etc as it rides up as you walkOverall it was just really saggy looking and did nothing for my body, I think if you are very tall/slender this could look amazing but also those body types look amazing in everything!",";)"
"2.0","The waist and length were fine but the top half fit terribly.","Only thing I would have been able to do is have it tailored if it were my dress."
"2.0","This dress didnt fit at all.","I am 411 and the length went past my knees unlike the model whose dress shows that it clearly is meant to be above the knee."

"2.0"," 3 strikes against this dress.","Im a 56, 125lbs, 34D hourglass and normally love halters.","1) It was sagging off me even for a small (the XS was not available as a backup).","2) The sequined material was really heavy & thick; even if it had fit I feel like it would have bunched in my waist.","3) The color had a strange brownish reflection within the blue color.","My husband said it looked like it was rotting.","Not flattering.","I sent it back immediately."
"2.0","the dress was very pretty but i am a 6-8 and the 8 did not fit me which was the largest size I ordered so unfortunately i did not get to wear the dress"

"2.0","It was a bit small and so hard to move the arms freely but even with a good fit I did not find this flattering at all."
"2.0","I did not end up wearing this and did not want to return for a bigger size because the top was so small and the hip/waste area was so big.","Other reviews said the sleeves were tight, but I did not find that the case.","Dress is pretty...just not for someone with bigger chest area."
"2.0","The chest was too small for the girls."
"2.0","I ordered a 4 and a 6 in this dress and couldnt get the right fit.","The 4 too small and the 6 too big.","The waistline and hem hit rather low in this gown which swallowed me up.","This dress is for a taller woman.","The fabric is slightly see through as well, so if you like to wear undergarments, they may show.","Its always a risk wearing a high neck if you have a full bust and this one makes you pay the price.","My chest looked twice as large.","I wasnt able to wear this dress, but the good people at RTR allowed me to return it and issued me a credit."

"2.0","The dress did indeed fit snugly, smushing my b-cups into a uniform blob across my chest.","But that wasnt the worst problem.","As I asked my significant other to zip me up, he asked me if that hole was supposed to be there.","For a him to notice a hole, it must have been huge.","Indeed, after scanning both shoulders, it became obvious that enough beadery was missing from both sides that I couldnt possibly pull the dress off at the classy party I was going to."

"2.0","Pros- Still unsureCons- Too short, too cheap and in the picture on RTW it looks like a darker blue.","When I got it it was a bright tacky blue.","Its not a designer looking dress by how cheap its made.","Also please note- RTW doesnt even LIST the color of the dress on their website.","Dont you think that is SEMI important detail to include to your potential customers?","Also in the size 2 the lining underneath the dress was longer and hung out below the sequin dress.","SO tacky and extremely poor quality."

"2.0","This dress made me feel broad and matronly - while accentuating a non-concave belly.","The line across the top of the dress liner does a fantastic job of making my slightly broad shoulders even bigger, while the waist pulls in just at the right spot to make me feel like I have a gigantic belly.","So - broad shoulders and a fat belly...","It is not going to the wedding with me!","This would be better for someone tall and narrow.","The 4 didnt fit in my arms, the 6 fit well.","I like the v- back, back zipper and color.","Pockets could be left out - as they are too high and only add fabric in a bad area."
"2.0","I am 54 and 120 lbs and Im surprised at just how large the small was.","I didnt get a backup size since I saved that for my formal option, but it was just unwearable.","So if you are closer to my height and weight, get the XS for sure."
"2.0","not right for what i wanted and it was to big, too long"
"2.0","I rented this for everyday work - and it was WAY WAYYYY too short and I am 51!!","It also looked VERY worn and should probably be taken out of rotation.","Did NOT end up wearing it."
"2.0","I ended up returning this dress.","The shape wasnt really doing much for me.","The fabric is stretchy; not sure if it was the material or sequins, but it seemed to show any little bulge without the dressing even being skin tight.","In terms of sizing, there wasnt much difference between the Small or Medium.","If I had to choose, I would have worn the Medium for the slightly longer length and larger arm hole opening."
"2.0","I had to return this one.","It was way too short and is very thick, has shoulder pads (didnt see that coming) and seemed to be made out of embroidered sweatshirt material.","It wasnt flattering at all and was far too short for any occasion!","Looks so cute on the model but didnt work on me at all."
"2.0","Although the dress (and fabric) was lovely and fit in all the other places I am not overly abundant on the top and could have put a small child in the gap at the back of the collar of the dress.","The front of the dresss collar lad flat, but the back did not.","I did not wear it."
"2.0","I loved the dress, but being 54 and long waisted, it just wasnt the right dress for me."

"2.0","Beautiful dress but the material doesnt stretch.","I couldnt fit it."
"2.0","Really liked this for everyday wear.","It was loose and comfy, but cute enough to go out to a happy hour."
"2.0","I loved this dress, but the fit was way off.","The waist was too small!","I could get it zipped, but it was tight and then the opening in the back was gapping.","It was a really odd fit.","I’m pretty average sized (chest-wise) so it surprised me the top was so big, yet the waist so small.","I suggest you size up and then size up again for your back-up size."
"2.0","I will not be able to wear the dress to my formal event because it is too big throughout the chest and waist, and the hem was too short-- up to my ankles even without shoes on."
"2.0","Loved the fit of this dress, but its not the advertised color.","The dress is black and grey, not black and white.","Might not be a big deal, unless you were counting on the dress being white as I was."
"2.0","Ive rented from RTR several times now, and I have to say this dress is my biggest disappointment so far.","To be fair, its an inexpensive rental, but the quality is not great.","Its a thin cotton that wrinkles easily and doesnt have a liner.","I tried the dress on when I received it and it fit fine at my normal size.","It wasnt the most flattering thing in the world, but Im tall with larger than average hips so Im not that picky.","However, the day of the event I was wearing it around the house for about 10 minutes before leaving and it became so wrinkled from just sitting down it couldnt be worn.","I ended up having to change into an old dress with a more forgiving fabric that wouldnt keep wrinkling all day.","Big disappointment!"
"2.0","This dress is not made for petite girls.","I am a size 0- & 53 tall and this dress like swallowed me and was very unflattering.","I had to send it back.","It is definitely a heavier material and a pretty dress just not what I was looking for."
"2.0","This romper is too short even though the fit was loose.","The fabric easily rumples and was asked if I slept in my clothes.","This is not an outfit to take on vacation if you are not wearing it to the beach."
"2.0","The dress runs small.","If youre a little on the thicker side I would suggest getting two sizes larger, especially if youre too heavy.","I wear an 8 and couldnt fit the 8L or 10L.","Also the dresses were on the shorter side.","It will not cover your shoes if youre my height or taller."
"2.0","Cons:Even the size 0 was so big I could not ware it.","It looks like the waste should be fitted but it is very large and made my wast look much wider than it really is.","Pros: It has pockets."
"2.0","If you have large boobs do not rent this dress.","You cannot wear a bra and lets face it... sticky boobs do not work for large breasted women."
"2.0","This dress is rose-gold.","The zipper was really difficult.","You will need a helper, because you cant zip it on your own!","Made me feel like I couldnt fit in it, but I think the zipper just has trouble where the fabric gathers.","Its a very pretty but flashy (!)","dress, so you will definitely get noticed.","Even more bling-y in person than in the photos.","That wasnt what I was going for.","Too bad, because I have the cutest rose-gold heels to pair with it.","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","It just didnt fit/feel right for me.","Im glad I ordered a backup dress (tibi black zeppelin), which was more understated.","I loved my backup, so it all worked out."
"2.0","I LOVE baggy clothes and most of the time I do wear oversized shirts, but I did not like this shirt.","I sent it back immediately after trying it on.","It was the type of baggy thats like a shapeless brown paper sack.","Pass!"
"2.0","This dress just didnt work for me.","There was too much material and it made me look very thick and straight around the middle, which is strange since I have more of an hourglass shape.","I possibly could have worn the dress despite the less than flattering fit except that the sleeves were way too big and droopy.","I have thin arms but never expected the sleeves to be such a problem.","Its possible that a smaller size might have looked more fitted, but I still think there would have been too much material.","Thank goodness this was my backup dress.","I went with the Nicole Miller black sequin open back gown which was a much more flattering fit."
"2.0","I sent this one right back...it was so big and shapeless, I felt like it made me look larger.","I wouldnt recommend."
"2.0","Must wear either bra cups, strapless or no bra.","Nude wont work."
"2.0","Got this as my back up dress in a 12L and it was way too small.","I was able to get it zipped but just barely.","Once it was I could barely move and certainly couldnt sit down.","Did not end up wearing it.","If youre going to rent this dress I would get a bigger size."

"2.0","1. thick material2. waist was loose3. arms ran small"
"2.0","The jumpsuit photographs well on others but I didnt care for the fit.","Its definitely meant for more curvy girls to fill out the back side.","Im not curvy and quite petite, but the sleeves on this jumpsuit are extra tight.","This did not work for me but I still ended up wearing it to the party with a black leather jacket."
"2.0","Received 2 dress, 4 was fitted, didnt like the look...I never wear my dresses this fitted to my bottom.","It felt very uncomfortable, but didnt have enough time to find something else to wear, and the zipper kept sticking, along with broken clasp.","The dresses was received in this condition.","The size 6, was perfect, however, I received the the dress with a broken zipper....the dress runs small.","I had to make it work, but I was very disappointed with RTR, the rep was very helpful, by suggesting I order 2 days in advance next time.","I called RTR, as soon as I realized dress was a problem!"
"2.0","Awkward fit for someone who has a small chest."
"2.0","I was unable to wear this dress because it was a little too small.","I usually wear a 10, so I thought Id be safe with receiving a 10 and a 12, but even the 12 was too tight to zip up.","Be careful with these designer dresses, they run smaller than they say they are."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this for my event, as the size 12 was too tight on the thighs and the 14 was too large in the waist.","I think that you have to be careful if you have a curvy body type for this one.","Pretty dress though!"
"2.0","I am 52 and hover around 130lbs, 28 pants, 34 chest.","This looked absolutely horrible on me.","In an effort to protect my self esteem I didnt even take a photo to share on here.","I felt like Ursula from the little mermaid and not in a fun halloween way.","The dress was WAY to long, WAY to big in the shoulders (looked like I was wearing invisible shoulder pads lifting the dress from my frame), and very unflattering in the midsection (and my midsection is not a problem area.","I carry weight in my thighs).","I was super bummed, but luckily RTR accepted my return and gave me credit.","I ended up wearing a dress I had in my closet that didnt make me feel like an evil sea witch!"
"2.0","Felt like I was wearing a sweater dress.","I did not like the shoulder pads inside the dress.","I did not end up wearing this dress because I brought a back up in case I didnt like it."
"2.0","I rented size 4, which is what Ive rented in the past, but got a size 6 as a backup.","As soon as I saw the dresses, I realized how narrow the sleeves were.","I dont have particularly large upper arms, but I could barely squeeze into  the sleeves.","Once I did , I had almost no mobility; I was able to zip up the back, but I was terrified I would split a seem.","So, alas, I didnt get to wear the dress.","If you have stick arms, though, it should be fine.","Or, perhaps, if you go up 2 sizes!"
"2.0","It seemed to fit perfectly, except the top wouldnt stay up.","Could not wear it because of that."
"2.0","Fortunately, this dress didnt fit because I ended up finding the best possible dress for my wedding day.","The color was not as white as the picture (it is more of a dingy eggshell) and the underskirt is oddly shaped.","Granted, I do have legs like a cabbage patch doll, so unless you have thighs that are the same shape as your anlkes- your booty wont have much room to shake in this dress!","Dont get me wrong- it looks good on the model, but it wasnt flattering on a curvy figure"
"2.0","just way too small"
"2.0","Much too small, very form fitting."
"2.0","Too big up top!"
"2.0","They style looks amazing online but I found the fabric to be a little on the cheap side and decided against wearing the dress."
"2.0","So the dress itself fits great, but if you have a larger chest like I do (36D-DD) you most likely wont be able to move without the ladies falling out.","I even taped myself (Kim Kardashian style) and it was still too risky.","Overall however, the fit is great, the material is super comfy, super flattering, just not for women who have larger chests.","I wish I had been able to wear it because the color and style are great.","So disappointed."
"2.0","Pros: Material is thick and feels nice to the touch.","Cons: It seems to fit like a bodycon dress but not in a body contouring kind of way.","It shows off the tummy and love handles in an unflattering way."
"2.0","Dress was very pretty and I loved the fabric but it did not flatter me at all.","In fact, I looked extra fluffy.","Top was very loose as other reviewers have stated.","You need some fashion tape because every time I sat down I was flashing people my bra!","I wore 4 inch heels and dress was a tad too long but nothing too serious.","I recommend this dress for those girls who dont have too much junk in the trunk.","I love my butt but this made me look huge!"
"2.0","silhouette was cute with a high low hemline"
"2.0","The dress is not ideal for petite women.","Maybe a size 6 would have been better, but the 8 was ill-fitting and unflattering on me particularly in the back (it bunched up at my shoulders) and at my waist.","It made me look frumpy--Im not normally frumpy-looking.","If youre tall, its probably a great dress, but if youre short in the waist, this dress probably isnt the best fit."
"2.0","The fit of this dress was just odd.","The hips are very large but the bust very tight.","Ended up not wearing it."
"2.0","I was so excited about this dress, as it looked lovely online and in other individuals pictures.","However, the dress runs extremely large and the lace was super stretched out.","If you have a slim figure, I would definitely advise against this dress.","Even the 0 was too big for me, but for example in Aidan Maddox dresses, Im a 4.","You really need to be a curvy girl to be able to fill this out because Im 59, 125 lbs, 32C and i didnt come close.","Other than the personal fit, the dress was gorgeous!"
"2.0","Did not wear"
"2.0","I own several Equipment blouses in size small which fit fine, however this size small was huge on me.","Also, the buttons were chipped so I could not button the blouse.","I was not able to wear the garment"
"2.0","This was the dress my go-to-girl sent since my first dress was too big.","This one was even bigger and NOT a true petite.","Actual petite women cannot wear regular-length dresses that are just shortened because the torso, arms, and waist are still too long.","I was really hoping this service would work for me, but I need a true petite."
"2.0","Beautiful dress, but unfortunately it was too big for me, so I didnt end up wearing it."
"2.0","The first response I got to wearing this dress was, You look like you fell into a barrel of ruffles.","Thats what it feels like too, like Im a cake topper.","I paired it with the heels at first, then went to flats.","The dress is too short and has too many ruffles to put anything extra with it.","I wont rent it again, it simply  has too much going on for me.","All that said, however, I have gotten a fair amount of compliments on it....one woman even turned around on the sidewalk to tell me how much she loved the dress.","I guess it all depends on ones preference for ruffles."
"2.0","I rented this dress for a bridal shower.","Unfortunately, I couldnt wear this dress because it was so large.","Even with a belt, it was too big and completely shapeless.","The color and lace were beautiful, though like others have said, there were a lot of little strings hanging off the lace because it had been worn so many times before.","I recommend sizing down, maybe even two sizes smaller.","Luckily Ive always had great customer service with RTR and was able to return the dress for credit."
"2.0","Did not flatter my figure at all and made me look matronly.","Material is thick and I felt uncomfortable in all the fabric--it may look better on someone who has more curves as I am so straight and narrow and it did nothing for me.","I didnt end up wearing it and wore another option that was sent."
"2.0","Didnt end up wearing it, and returned immediately once I tried it on.","Seriously not a dress for petite women.","It fit, but the billowiness is overwhelming and truthfully unflattering.","Doesnt do anything for your shape.","Might look good if youre trying to cover up big arms or youre a skinny and tall waif, but not great for average sized women."
"2.0","The color, fabric, and fit were great, but I was unable to wear the dress because of the pockets.","The pockets dont lie flat and they hit right at the hips.","The visual effect was to make my hips twice as wide as they really are.","The profile view of the dress was great but dont rent it if you have hips and dont want them accentuated."
"2.0","The dress was adorable, and I really wanted to wear it.","I wore the size 0, and the chest area still stuck out, loosely.","It was way too big!","(Granted my bra size is 32A - but still.","It was a 0! )"
"2.0","Pretty but not for me.","The sheer fabric was stiff, not flowing as I expected.","It was short on me, and Im only 53  The neck ribbon when tied laid in an odd way."
"2.0","This dress is not a long.","I am 510 and it literally hit me above my ankles; I was shocked how short it was.","Do not rent if you are over 57!","BEWARE!"
"2.0","The dress was super tight on the rib cage.","I wear a Size  pants, my wedding dress is a Size 12 and had to be taken in a lot, and this Size 10 barely zipped over my rib cage, but had a LOT of extra material below the waist.","Also, my boobs were barely contained, not appropriate!"
"2.0","Didnt fit at all.","Not made for fit girls with boobs.","And even if it zipped there was a ton of loose fabric around the belly area.","Yuck!"
"2.0","It is long.","I am 54 and 100 pounds, way too large"
"2.0","This ran very small and hit me funny in the hips, so I couldnt wear it.","I was also disappointed in the material.","It was SO thick that it was bulky and didnt drape well."
"2.0","awkward drooping under arms, would have to wear a tank under it.","didnt wear."
"2.0","I dont recommend this dress for girls with big boobs.","RTR sent this to me as a backup since my original dress wasnt available and this fell flat.","Color is more muted, kind of a silvery gray color and it did not go well with my complexion (Im fair skinned, have pink undertones).","The dress felt stretched out, so Id opt for a smaller size as your backup rather than a larger size."
"2.0","Oy!","This dress was all sorts of wrong for me.","It just fit me like a giant garbage bag.","It hangs very long in the skirt (and Im not a short girl) and the top was just too too big.","Way too much fabric around the chest/shoulders for me.","Maybe I needed a smaller size, but it fit perfectly in the waist so any smaller would have been too tight I think.","They cant all be winners, and this one wasnt a winner for me.","Luckily, the RTR team responded quickly to my exchange and got me another option in time for my event."
"2.0","This is a beautiful dress that would look amazing on someone with more of narrow shape.","If you have hips, do not rent this dress.","The material on the bottom is very heavy and there is a  LOT of it.","When I put it on, it looked great from the waist up, but oh my goodness ...the waist down was horrible.","I took it off faster than I put it on.","It made my hips look 10x bigger than they already are.","The fit is true to size, it even buttoned well with a large chest, no gaps.","I didnt not wear this dress, it went back quickly.","Sorry, no photo, I didnt have it on long enough."
"2.0","This item is just awkward; sizing was true to size, however, it was just an odd cut."
"2.0","It fit but was not comfortable enough to sit down and eat a special dinner :("
"2.0","I am normally between a 0 and 2.","I ordered a 2 and there is NO WAY I would be able to wear this to work.","This is fairly sheer if you hold it up, and is definitely VERY small.","Looks cute on-line but is very basic in person.","Would not recommend."
"2.0","Did not fit well at all"
"2.0","It fit me strangely.","Very tight at the ribs (not the bust, the ribs) and loose at the waist.","I am curvy, so maybe it would fit someone else better."
"2.0","The dress is purple (vs periwinkle) and made from the same material as the robes worn in a hair salon.","The cut is cute, but the fabric is a deal-breaker.","Did not wear it in public."
"2.0","Ugh, dreadful.","Returned it without even wearing it anywhere."
"2.0","I saw some other people describing the dress as small, but this thing was RIDICULOUS.","I ordered an 8, and I can normally wear a 6 or an 8 depending on the hips, but this one I couldnt even get my arms all the way through.","Lets say Im a standard 8, Id venture the guess the 8 I rented would fit a size 2 or 0.","It was super disappointing as this was the dress I wanted to wear for my birthday and ending up wearing an adidas tee shirt instead."
"2.0","This could have been a great jumpsuit, but it was too short for me and looked ridiculous.","Otherwise, the cut was flattering and elegant.","The color was great too.","Wish RTR carried this in a longer length."
"2.0","Ive tried this dress in a 4, 6, and 8 and each size fits awkward in some place.","The 4, which is my normal size was overall too tight, so definitely size up.","I would say the 6 fit, but it was so short, I couldnt even walk.","The 8 fit in the length, but was so loose in the top (I am a 34D).","Overall, I love this brand, but this dress was a total miss."
"2.0","I took a chance on this dress after reading other reviews, but it just did not work for me.","The gathering on the front an back may look beautiful on someone with a longer torso, but didnt work for me.","I tried both the 8L and 8R because I knew I would be wearing a 4 inch heel.","The 8L would have been long enough, but the gathering sat below my belly and looked off.","The 8R would have been to short with the heels.","It did however look nicer on my midsection (gathering fell at my belly button), but the zipper in the back bunched in odd places....just didnt work for me."
"2.0","I rented this for everyday use.","The jacket itself was quite cute in person and a great leather material-- not too stiff.","However, I was not able to wear it as it was highly unflattering with my larger bust.","I dont mind boxy styles but the large was too big around the armpits and rather than a cute cropped style was just overwhelming.","The medium then was too tight and again not flattering.","Would recommend for smaller busts only."
"2.0","I was so excited for this RTR for NYE.. however the fit on me was awful.","The pleats in the front made me look like I was pregnant (my sister: your stomach looks like it sticks out twice as far as your boobs) and the zipper in the back was all bumpy near the butt, which looked even worse than the front.","The butt alone would have been enough for me not to wear it, it looked terrible.","Im a slender girl, flat stomach, small butt, and this dress made me look the opposite.","Not recommended for small girls."
"2.0","the gathers in the fabric on this dress are difficult to see in the photos but once i put it on it really was very unflattering to my figure.","i have a relatively flat stomach and this added volume in weird places.","didnt wear it out."
"2.0","I really wanted to love this dress.","Its work appropriate and still a bit edgy with the leather trim.","The dress is thick and heavy - terrible for the heatwave were currently in but perfect for a crisp fall day.","Unfortunately, the leather trim is much tighter than the rest of the dress leaving me looking like I was bulging between leather stripes when really it was just the material bunching up.","The leather trim around the hips hit me a bit too low and caused the dress to bunch up into a sort of muffin top.","The arms are incredibly tight though I do play softball so maybe I just have larger arms?","I couldnt reach up to put my hair into a ponytail.","The worst part was the leather across the chest dug in so much that it gave me two boobs per side - half a boob above the leather and the other half below - and flattened me into an unflattering, lumpy, uniboob."
"2.0","Like the other reviewer said...","I have a long torso and it just looked bizarre.","The bottom is very heavy, it looked like a flowy maxi in the pictures but its a thick skirt.","Just couldnt wear it, not appropriate for a wedding shower."
"2.0","This top is way bigger than runs large.","Sleeve length is fine, but the flowy top is so large that I couldnt even wear it.","Cute material, looks great on the model in the image, but this shirt runs really, really, really large.","Definitely go down a size (or two)."
"2.0","I couldnt wear this.","It was very tight in the arms and chest.","I have small arms and I couldnt move them."
"2.0","The dress was entirely too short and did not fit well.","It was too tight in my thighs (which arent huge) and bunchy in the stomach.","Couldnt wear it out, so I had to run out and buy another dress for the event."
"2.0","Im 57 and saw that someone who was 510 rented this and got a size 12. wellllllll that girl must not have had curves.","The dress did fit but goodness if I bent over for anything I would show the world my hello kitty.","I returned and went with a dress I already owned"
"2.0","Couldnt zip.","Not good for large chest"
"2.0","There is a big piece of fabric that drapes down around one of the hips - terrible!","Not flattering in any way.","Fabric felt cheap, too."
"2.0","This dress was something I thought Id love since peplum is my FAVORITE.","BUT- this was a very tight dress (even though I went up a size) and the fabric was thick and textured (you dont see it very well in the pictures).","I got it for work, Im a news anchor, but ultimately determined it was too uncomfortable to anchor in for 5 hours.","All in all this is a nice dress but you need to go at least a size up maybe 2 sizes up to be comfy if you have an athletic frame.","The sleeve area was very restricting and I have a very small bust and average sized arms/shoulders.","I didnt end up wearing this dress so there are no pictures."
"2.0","This dress definitely did not fit my body style.","I am hour-glass shaped and even though this dress is supposed to be for every woman it definitely was not.","The breast section kept moving and it just was not comfortable to wear.","Definitely was not flattering at all."
"2.0","Very disappointing I got 2 sizes larger than what I wear because it was all they had in stock for my event.","When the dress arrived I  could not get it to zip up.","I ended up having to go out and find a whole new dress before my event."
"2.0","Unfortunately this was way too big all around.","The length could have worked with heels but the body of the dress and the chest were massive"
"2.0","I may have gotten too big of a size, but this dress did not complement my curves at all.","I have an extremely pear shaped body, and it just kind of hung over it, making me look very boxy.","Will not wear this to any events."
"2.0","I wear a size for, occasionally a 6 will work...there is no way I am a 2 but the 4 was definitely too big on me and did not look right given the design of the dress.","Couldnt wear it to my party unfortunately."
"2.0","This top looked super cute on the pics, but the fit was really awkward.","First of all, it runs small.","Waaay small.","Im 53, bust size 34 D and this top was not only tight but also short.","The top shoulder part did not lay down flat, but kept curling up.","I sent it back after trying it on.","Bummer.",":("
"2.0","This dress was so short I couldnt wear it without flashing my private bits to everyone, let alone sit down!","It was also baggy in the stomach area too which made no sense.","The quality was awesome and even the shoulder pads were workable, but Id be careful with this one if you have any height."
"2.0","I rented an 18W and 20W to be safe.","Im not sure they were W but they both still fit OK but the 20 was a bit more comfortable in the rib area.","However I was unable to wear either because of the cut of the dress.... at the top of the dress (at armpit level) was cut in SO FAR that you could see most of my bra!..","I wear a full coverage bra so Im always careful to select things that are tank top-ish so that I can wear the larger strap, but this was cut so far into the dress that it just didnt work.","Its a shame because the dress was beautiful and I was so excited to see it in person!","I ended up wearing an old reliable out of my closet."
"2.0","I am 510 and with this dress on in barefeet, the 6L was flooded two inches up my ankles.","I was unable to wear it to the event and ended up having to go out and find another dress last minute.","I do not recommend this dress if you are 58 or above as it will not be long enough for you even when wearing flats."

"2.0","size up, size up, size up....my dresses did not fit on my graduation night....I had to pull an old dress from my old closet to wear underneath my graduation robe.....this dress has a high, fitted waist and the material is heavy and will no give, ladies, please size up....dont focus on the dress size...if you usually wear a certain size, go up one or two sizes or else you will be disappointed when your dress doesnt fit!"
"2.0","weird fit in waist and hips"
"2.0","I sized up because Im used to doing that at this point.","It did not fit over my boobs though.","Neckline and waist were good fits, but my chest is just too big for things I guess.","Its not even really that big.","38D wouldnt fit into a size 10 dress.","I was really disappointed.","And when I scheduled my rental, there were out of the alternative size (the 12, where I thought I was being super generous with sizing).","This was my first rental.","Bummer."

"2.0","I did not wear the dress.","The fabric felt cheap and showed every line of every undergarment I had on.","If you are larger in the chest this is not the dress for you.","I am a 34 D-34DD and it was very tight around the bust  and tight in the sleeves.","Fit fine is the rest of the body.","Not much of a fit difference in these areas even with my larger backup size.","Unfortunately I didnt have time to get a new dress before my event.","Love RTR and their excellent service, just disappointed with this dress."
"2.0","Very small and short in length.","Order up.","Little stretch."

"2.0","I thought this looked so cute in the photos, I was wrong.","This dress was more like a tunic on me.","I am 57 and it was mini.","It also has a border of lace running through a strange spot around the hip area.","I wish it fit me better, or next time I would size up."
"2.0","Unable to wear.","I ordered a size 0 and 2 as backup.","The size 0 was ok, but I would have preferred to wear the size 2.","In the size O I didnt have much room, it was very fitted and it didnt stretch.","The size 2 I was unable to wear because it had a weird smell that I couldnt handle it.","I know the size 2 would have been perfect.","Wont rent again."
"2.0","Fit was not very good, the 2 would have been to tight on the bottom and perfect on top, How ever the 4 was perfect on the bottom and to loose on the top.","I was unable to wear it for my Even :0( but"
"2.0",""
"2.0","Material is heavy, stretchy and wonderful feeling.","You can spot a $300+ dress from its craftsmanship, something I love from RTR.","Unfortunately, this dress is meant for thin, slim hipped small breasted women.","The dress fit but exposed my butt cheeks!","Absolutely not appropriate to wear outside the house - my husband was dying laughing zipping me up.",".","I am 55 34D/DD with a 65% WHR (waist hip ratio).","Halston Heritage, Erin Erin Fetherston, Marchesa Voyage & Rachel Roy size 8 all fit me perfectly.","This dress is meant for narrow hipped, small breasted straight/narrow builds.","And it is DEFINITELY not work appropriate UNLESS you are 53 or below and slim/narrow build.",".","Women 54-57 this is a short dress, absolutely meant for a date night but not for a cocktail hour or formal dinner.","DO NOT rent this if youre taller than 57, you WILL be exposed!"
"2.0","Great color, but the fit was just not for me.","I wanted to wear it tucked in with a pencil skirt, but the ruffle looks weird tucked in.","Unfortunately it was just too bulky untucked, yet also strangely a tad tight in the arms."
"2.0","I am pretty short and got the short version of this dress - I was shocked at how short it actually was!","Did not end up wearing."
"2.0","Beware if you are bustier.","This is not friendly or flattering for a full chest.","Id also be cautious of this dress unless you are toned in the chest and arms because the sleeve style exaggerates any excess fat in the front chest area.","Im 56 and this dress was longer on me than pictured on the model so really the only thing being shown off in this dress is your arms unless you are tall."
"2.0","Super bummed with the length of this dress--I ordered the regular length and it was WAY too short (above the ankles).","I am 56 and usually wear kitten heels but I wouldnt have been able to even wear flats.","Definitely order the long!","On the bright side, this dress has a beautiful neckline!","Sad to have to return!"
"2.0","This was an awful rental.","I am 59 and typically a size 10.","They only have a size 12 available so I rented that.","I put it on and it literally came up to my hips.","Everything below hung out.","I could not figure this out to save my life.","It fit like a shirt.","I am not sure if this dress was defective or put through a shrinking device.","I measured the length with a tape measure and it was 22 inches long.","Beware!"
"2.0","I typically wear a size eight, but even the ten did not come close to fitting in this style.","I love Shoshanna and this dress would have been fabulous if the fabric had some stretch to it.","It really doesnt, so beware if youre hippy or busty and size up accordingly."
"2.0","This gown runs small overall.","I ordered both the 8L and the 10R after reading many reviews, but neither dress fit properly, so I didnt wear either of them.","I am 57, 142 lbs, 36C+ Bust, 29 1/2 waist, 38 1/2 hip.","The 10R was too short with 3 heels, and overall it was too tight.","Also, the lining was longer than the dress by more than one inch."
"2.0","very boxy (has shoulder pads) and very wide.","This felt like a size 8, instead of a 4.","I couldnt wear it at all."
"2.0","This a beautiful shirt, but the material was strange for me.","It stuck to my body in an unflattering way.","Also, the sleeves are very wide and very short.","I didn’t notice it in the model photo, but you might want to look closely at that detail and see if its what you are looking for.","I didn’t end up wearing this item."
"2.0","This.","dress.","is.","HUGE.","Im normally a 4, I ordered the 4 and a 2 as a backup.","I read that this dress runs big, but I looked at the reviews of people with similar body types that I have and I hoped that it would work even if it was a little too big.","Well let me tell you, the 2 looked absolutely ridiculous on me.","There was no chance of me being able to wear it even if I was okay with it being loose.","It wasnt even that it didnt hug my waist the way I wanted, its that there was just SO much material in the skirt.","Even if I had ordered the 0, it would not have even come close to fitting.","I ended up swapping it for a different dress of the same brand (slate and willow).","The new dress I got was a 0 and fit well (reminder, Im normally a 4).","So, my advice is that this brand seems to run large, however this dress in particular is EXTREMELY large.","I would not get this dress if you have a similar body type to me, or smaller.","Its a shame, because I absolutely love how classy and cute it is."
"2.0","The dress fit beautifully but I only wore it for about 10 minutes because the static cling caused the dress to slowly creep up my legs.","I was staying on the Queen Mary and had no way to get something to help.","Friends suggested hairspray and it didnt work.","I really wanted to look beautiful on my 50th birthday.","I was very disappointed"
"2.0","Dress was a little too risqué for work- tight, short, and had a big cut out on the back that was more extreme than I thought, so I did not end up using the rental.","It would have been perfect for an event, but not for work!"
"2.0","I was so excited to get this dress for a work cocktail party but so sad when I tried it on.","The dress fit everywhere - the waist, hips, butt were fitted nicely and even the length was perfect for my 52 frame.","However, I could barely fill the bust.","My chest is very proportionate to the rest of me but I would have to be 2 times my cup size in order to fill this dress.","Maybe the dress had been stretched out?","I was so disappointed!","I had to send it back."
"2.0","I rented this dress for my engagement photos and was very disappointed.","I order from rtr for a few years now, and this dress really let me down.","The fit was terrible and it hung awkwardly on my frame.","I ended not using this dress for my photos."
"2.0","Material too thickNo silhouetteBulky fit"
"2.0","I wore this for wedding in Saratoga Springs and it was the prefect look for the occasion.","However, the top of this dress is way too big for the waist it fits.","Unless you have a large chest, I would recommend trying a different dress.","I had to pin it in the back to keep it from falling down and even with the pin, I still had to pay close attention to it all night.","I love the way it looked but it was definitely a distraction for the entire night to make sure it wasnt falling off."
"2.0","The dress I received looked really odd and did not fit.","I have an athletic figure with a large booty and unfortunately, I dont think this dress  is meant for large butts.","The dress also seemed quite a bit shorter than it look on the model, but that may have been because of the rear issue.","Bottom line, the color and quality of the dress seem nice, but do not rent this if you have a large backside, because it probably wont fit, even sizing up."
"2.0","Did not like the fit on the cap sleeves.","It also stuck out on one hip.","Bummer....great looking dress."
"2.0","Absolutely gorgeous dress.","Absolutely did not fit.","There was NO chance this dress was zipping around my chest.","Please, ladies with a larger chest, SIZE UP.","I was super disappointed to not be able to wear the dress at all."

"2.0","I tried on this top and immediately did not like it.","The material is thick and stiffer than I thought it would be and it didnt drape, as it seems to on other women who wore it.","Instead, the fabric kind of shot out from the peak of my breasts in a really unflattering way.","And Im small chested.","Didnt wear it."
"2.0","I ordered this dress in hopes to wear it to a Masquerade Ball, however, it was extremely short and looked ridiculous on.","I was unable to wear it.","Very disappointed."
"2.0","I rented this for a military graduation and had to call to get a replacement dress.","I ordered the 0 and It fit more like a 4.","The fabric is stretchy as well."
"2.0","It bunched in some areas.","Would not rent it again."
"2.0","The armpits were cut out in a really odd way so unless you are super thin or have your arms up, the gap between the cap sleeve and the chest looks funky and flabby.","The fabric around the waste was baggy as well even though the liner was tight underneath.","Maybe wouldve looked better in a 4?","I ordered it for my bachelorette party and got new shoes to go with it, too.","Oh well.","Still love RTR!"
"2.0","makes your chest look really odd"
"2.0","This dress is horrible for anyone with an average/long torso or legs.","The inner lining stopped mid-buttocks, leaving me feeling quite exposed.","This was not a wearable dress and should have included information on the length of the extremely short lining."
"2.0","This dress would have been perfect had the seams been checked before sending out.","The side/hip seems were ripped and were extremely noticeable.","Very disappointed in RTR.","Even though they sent me a new one to wear overnight to the hotel we were staying at for the wedding, it wasnt my first choice."

"2.0","This dress looked beautiful in pictures and on other girls.","I am 60 tall, straight body shape.","The xtra long didnt even hit the floor and the dress made me look like a rectangle.","There was no was that I could wear it out.","Very disappointing."
"2.0","The entire dress stuck to my body with the unfortunate exception of extended armpits.","There was no blousy effect on the top so it was just a horrible mismatch to my body, and the material is not soft like a sweater but rather a strange stiff rayon.","I love how it looks on the model... but if you arent stick thin on top and want to try it, size way up."
"2.0","Just a little too snug around the hips; as other reviewers noted, theres no give or stretch with this one so either size up or skip this one if you have hips/booty like me :)"
"2.0","The pleats on this dress made it very unflattering in the belly area since the fabric is pretty thick.","I dont have the flattest belly, so i usually like a dress with this shape, but it puffed out significantly!"
"2.0","I got two dresses for my event to be sure to find the right one.","This was not it.","The zipper was ridiculously frustrating and I couldnt get it to zip up.","Very frumpy in the hips and butt.","Glad I had another one picked out.","This was a fail."
"2.0","This dress runs large in the top."
"2.0","Unfortunately this dress was not at all what I expected.","It reminded me of an upscale version of a quilt my grandmother had.","The pattern/colors is not at all what the photo shows."
"2.0","This dress looks stunning in the pictures but personally, this dress looked awful on me.","It was SO unflattering!","The dress was also way too short.","I dont think I would recommend this dress to someone without curves."
"2.0","The pants run a bit large and they show for that when you try them on (length and overall).","They do not look or feel good on - I didnt bother wearing them."
"2.0","This was huge!","More like a moo moo tunic.","I am busty and it was not flattering, must layer this pierce as everything is exposed."
"2.0","The front button wouldnt stay closed and tape wouldnt work either.","It was a pain."
"2.0","This dress fits very snug.","I am top heavy (36 DD) and ended up returning this dress because it didnt fit.","The sequins snag your hair so be careful when putting this dress on and put your hair up :-)"
"2.0","Dress ran much larger than I expected.","I am usually a true 10 in dresses but the top half was quite baggy and didnt fall smooth on my body.","Really bummed because I love the cut and style so much, might try again and see if the size 8 works."
"2.0","Very unflattering fit."
"2.0","This dress was beautiful, but the zipper was hard to manipulate, even with the dress off.","Once it was on, it would only zip up midway up my back.","No amount of coaxing the zipper would work.","Rtr customer service said that a larger chest had a hard time fitting that dress.","I dont consider myself busty ( I wasnt even coming close to filling out the cups) but the dress just wasnt going to work.","Too bad, because it is a beautiful color."
"2.0","Dress looked great on website, fit well through shoulders, chest, hips, but was very large around stomach."
"2.0","If you have a relatively large chest you will find this dress runs somewhat small, would have loved to wear the 10R but the zipper wasnt functional, beautiful color though"
"2.0","Looked cheap and didnt fit right.","Never wore for event"
"2.0","The material of the dress is great for the cold weatherbc its sooo heavy and thick, I normally wear a size 6 but I read that it ran small on some ppl so I got the 8 incase.","I could get it on...but it wasnt pretty.","It just didnt fit right and was pretty short.","Next time Id go up a size.","Really bummed...I was so excited to wear it for my birthday and it was my 1st RTR experience.","Better luck next time hopefully!"
"2.0","I wasnt able to wear it because it was too small"
"2.0","I rented this dress because the color was bright and eye-catching.","However, sadly there was no way I could have worn this dress because it was too big (even a size 0R).","From now on, I avoid dresses from this designer unless there is a 00R available that I could possibly try and hopefully fit.","Otherwise, Id pass because the size is just too big for me."
"2.0","After an issue with my order for a wedding weekend, RTR stylists sent me this dress along with a few other options.","This dress is really unflattering and is made of a weird foam-like material.","The dress was enormous and is NOT recommended for someone who is under 510.","I can see this being cute on a model, but not ordinary women.","May be a good option for a costume or themed party, but definitely not a wedding."
"2.0","I rented this dress for  a wedding, I figured I would be comfortable and feel pretty in this dress while being 22 weeks pregnant.","However, it did feel comfortable and loose around my bump, but the sleeves were too big, it looked I was wearing an outfit to sing at a choir.","I did not like how I looked in this dress."
"2.0","It was VERY big and on the long side.","It fell at an odd part of the knee and it was just an overall, unflattering dress!."
"2.0","Pros:It looked great in the bagWas long enough, even with 4 heelsCons:Unflattering on my bodySuper itchyTook 3 people to get the zipper to move (completely stuck)"
"2.0","This dress is beautiful but the cut of the dress makes it hard to wear - it runs small and if you have a large back or chest I would stay away from this dress.","I have tried on two separate occasions to wear this dress in two different sizes and it always fails based upon my body dimensions."
"2.0","This dress was just not the right shape for me at all.","It made me seem wider in the shoulders and hips than I am.","Im usually a 2 but this was snug around the shoulders.","Pretty material but the shape was just not for me!"
"2.0","This dress is very pretty, but I was unable to wear it or the other dress I rented.","When I tried the dresses on, it made my hips look extremely wide.","So much so, that it looked like I was wearing something under the dress to make it poof out more.","I have narrow hips, so it was pretty shocking.","I looked at many of the reviews and the pictures sent in by people who wore the dress and I didnt notice that on anyone else, so I am not sure why it looked like that on me."
"2.0","Rented this as part of unlimited subscription.","Dress arrived brand new, with tags still attached.","Dress was   obviously of a very high quality and very well made but fit was surprisingly loose and not form fitting at all.","I am a S/M and rented the size 42 and I could have easily sized down two times, I am sure.","Print was lovely, but dress was just not for me."
"2.0","I ended up exchanging this dress for another one.","It is really short (even on me -- Im 52) and the fabric on the arms is actually painful to wear.","It is almost as if the dress is made out of sandpaper.","Its a cute look but would be miserable to wear for a whole night."
"2.0","Jumpsuit is cute- cuts low but not scandalously so, and has fun fringe at the shoulders.","The only downside is how freakishly short - even with a long length - it is.","I couldnt wear it at all as a 510 woman."
"2.0","I really was not into this jumpsuit.","It has a zipper in the front to customize cleavage levels, but given the crepe feel of the fabric, the overall look was like a wearing a onesie to bed.","I did not wear this out, and just sent it back immediately."
"2.0","its very pretty and had it fit Im sure I would have loved it, but alas it was too big."
"2.0","Too tight.","Make sure youre in shape or have a flat stomach or else it shows every adipose tissue on your body."
"2.0","The dress was gorgeous, the material and print made this dress stunning.","BUT, order the dress at least one size up.","I ordered a size 12, but I could have gone with a 16.","The dress was extremely tight and long, it barely zipped up, thank goodness for the fabulous return policy that Rent the Runway has!"
"2.0","The sleeves were way too big and too long as well.","It is made of a very heavy cotton that does not look or feel luxurious.","Not sure if it was because it had been rented many times before, but the black looked faded - like a t-shirt that had been through the wash too many times.","I generally like tops that cinch in at the waist; however, because of the material I felt it was not flattering the way other similar tops have been flattering on me."
"2.0","This dress was HUGE on me, couldnt wear it.","Rented both the 0 and 2 and both were huge, big in the bust and hips, overall unflattering.","Go for the Nicole Miller lave dresses, they fit much better."
"2.0","After I tried it on, the snap broke.","I decided it was too risky to try and wear it."
"2.0","The fit on this was bizarre.","It seems as if the bodice is supposed to blouse a bit, but the zipper is way too stiff to accommodate that and so it ripples in a terrible way.","The zipper also sticks out at the bottom, essentially giving you a tail.","Im not sure if the zipper got replaced at some point on this dress, but if so, they did a terrible job of it, because the dress is completely unwearable."
"2.0","Does not look as good in the pictures as it does in person.","Dress runs small and leaves no room for stretch to fit.","Be safe and go up two sizes."
"2.0","it fell off the shoulder---very largebut cute"
"2.0","Would have loved to wear it but it was too small.","I could barely zip it.","Looked like other girls my size wore the medium but I couldnt breathe in it and felt as though it wasnt very flattering.","Im sure I would have loved it in a size up!"
"2.0","Nicholas is one of my go-to brands for formal occasions.","Im really petite and their dresses, tops, and skirts run small so I was very surprised when this gown was really loose in the bust area.","Pretty color though."
"2.0","I didnt wear it.","I would wear if I am like 16 years old...."
"2.0","Its really not what I expected.","Short in the front and just not very flattering.","I ended up buying something."
"2.0","Too large overall for my frame"
"2.0","Fit okay in the top, The bottom was huge- looked like a paper bag on."
"2.0","I love jumpsuits and I was excited about the garnet color and modern neckline on this piece but the fit is strange as are the flyaway legs.","The midsection was too big.","Overall it was not at all flattering on me."
"2.0","Great color and design but not worth how uncomfortable this dress is.","Overall it is very stiff with no give.","Would be better for an event where you were standing and not moving around much.","Not ideal for a wedding as it is almost impossible to dance around in.","Also the dress is very short.","I am 5 3 and it was still too short.","Overall would not recommend."
"2.0","I couldnt wear this dress it would not zip up on me.","My back tends to be wider then regular girls my height.","Very small on the waist.","But the color was perfect red and the dress looked fun to wear."

"2.0","I wear a size 14 so I  ordered a 16.","The zipper would not even touch in the chest area.",".","Very, very disappointed!!","So I just wasted a $100 ."
"2.0","Really cute pattern- but the fit was just not for me.","I ended up not wearing it.","I think for somoene more apple shaped or straight up and down this dress could possibly be good, but on my hourglass figure it was baggy around the waist while being tight acorss the chest, shouldres and hips.","I tried belting the elsatic waist to make it more flattering, but there was so much extra fabric right below the elastic waist that the bunch under the belt looked unflattering.","Not for me, but very cute fabric that was thick and looked expensive.","Coudl be good for someone with the right body type."
"2.0","I did not wear this dress because it was incredibly unflattering.","It fit, but the panels on the sides jut out and look very awkward."
"2.0","Loved the colors and pattern.","Body of dress was true to size and comfortable for fit.","Liked the weight of the fabric for cool temperatures.","Would not advise for warm seasons.","Arms were extremely tight and I have slender arms.","Most bracelets are usually too large for my wrist.","All of the seams are very scratchy.","I found this dress to be uncomfortable overall and will not rent again."
"2.0","didnt wear it- couldnt possibly fit into it"

"2.0","I ordered this coat for a trip to Paris thinking a shape that offers room for layers would be great.","I headed reviews and ordered the smallest size and man were the reviews understating how big it is.","This coat is soooooo labeled I could easily have gotten a 000 if one existed!","It was huge everywhere (actually so large its a joke)-- and it would have been a joke to wear.","I think I could have fit another person in this coat with me and closed it no problem.","SIZE DOWN at least 2 sizes!","Small people stay away."
"2.0","way too big, was like a tent on me."
"2.0","Couldnt wear it.","I lack in the breast department so when I put it on my boyfriend basically said you look like a flinstone"
"2.0","RTR only has XS available, which is my size, but i was unable to get a backup dress in S.  Turns out, it runs *really* small, and i couldnt get the dress to zip up all the way.","If a backupsize of small had been available it would have been fine.","I ended up wearing one of my own dresses to the weekend party i was attending.","I also thought this dress was most unflattering for a tall skinny/athletic build, especially when viewed from the side.","As much as i love the look of the dress, i cant recommend it."
"2.0","This dress was huge!!","It was baggy, and huge in the bust.","I am typically between a 4 and 6 and I think I would have needed a 2 in this.","Color was beautiful and lace looked nice, but this one was a complete miss for me.","Also, I am tall and it was still very long.","I wanted a long dress for a conservative wedding, but BEWARE if you are short - this thing will come to your shins."
"2.0","Awkward fit despite neoprene material."
"2.0","I normally dont listen to reviews because my body frame is smaller than most so I can wear almost anything.","WRONG!","Super cute in front although the button clasp easily pops off and the boobage is real.","But turn around and holy moly!","I couldnt leave the house:( Its not that they are too short because thats assuming this is a skort.","Its that they are underwear.","Id say listen to all the other review and dont be stubborn like I was; dont rent this."

"2.0","This dress seemed to fit perfectly and looked great on.","Unfortunately, the problem started AFTER I left the house.","As soon as I would walk around, the dress would start to twist around me until the back slit was almost in front.","No matter what I did, it continued.","I had to keep going to the restroom to unzip it and take it all the way off to get it straight again.","The only way to avoid this was to stand perfectly still."
"2.0","The fit is tru to size, but its way too long for me.","I am 54.","Id have to wear giant wedges and even then the dress will touch the floor.","Also, the fabric is very thin and only the bottom half is lined.","So the top is semi-transparent.","Returning it."
"2.0","This dress was boxy and quite long on me as I am petite.","It did my body no favors anywhere and I decided not to wear it.","The fabric looks like it would be good for the office or a sober type of affair, but there is nothing special about it."
"2.0","I rented this to wear to church for Easter.","The dress is pretty, the pink is much more vibrant in person.","The fabric is very thick.","Unfortunately, the lining is 2 sizes smaller than the actual dress.","It was also clear that it had been repaired several times, which will only tighten the material further.","If I owned this dress, I would probably have the lining removed because it isnt necessary as the dress material is so thick.","I ended up not wearing the dress because I could not bend down, sit down comfortably, nor host an Easter lunch after church."
"2.0","It made my hips look really wide and emphasized my flaws.","The fabric was like a heavy crepe.","Not very comfortable."
"2.0","no, of course not!","but, i was SWIMMING in this dress.","its beautiful for sure, but even the extra small was too big.","i couldnt wear this dress.","i even tried using a belt to help with the excess space/fabric around the mid-section, but it was still too big.","my suggestion, dont rent this dress if you are smaller than a size 8. i did not take a photo as it was just too ridiculous looking."
"2.0","No so keen, it has not tight but the sequins look a bit too shiny and therefore cheap... it does have a nice cut though and is flattering on."

"2.0","The length of the sleeves were perfect, but I didnt like the neck line.","There wasnt anything special about it."
"2.0","This dress doesnt really work well on Petities because of where the waistline falls.","It ended up sitting on my hips and made it look like it was more of a flapper style dress - there was no waist cinching like it looks like in the photos.","I probably would have been better off in a regular 14 or 16 instead of the wide sizes because they were just all around too big.","Such a shame - I loved the online look of this dress."

"2.0","Ordered in 10 and 12 but normally wear an 8.","Interior lining bunches in both dresses to look frumpy and since the overlay is sheer this just looks terrible.","Also, the color on the website makes this look bright and pink but in reality it is more salmon colored.","I could not wear this dress to my event sadly."

"2.0","Im 51 and I have bigger boobs with a shorter torso.","The ruffles of this top hit me right at the worst part of my belly.","It looked like I was wearing a chinese lantern.","Just completely unflattering.","I didnt wear it."
"2.0","I rented this dress in a 6P, which usually fits me perfectly.","However, based on evidence I do not believe the dress was manufactured petite, but rather altered to be petite.","When I received the order, I thought they had sent the wrong size at first, because the tag said 6 but someone had drawn a slash on it with sharpie--Im guessing this indicated it was altered.","They failed to take into account the torso when altering, so while the skirt length fell perfectly, the torso was far too long.","Even with my ample chest I could not wear this  dress.","Word to the wise, when you alter a dress to be petite, you need to alter the entire dress and not just the skirt length!","If you are short such as myself, I would steer away, unless you have a longer torso and short legs.","For reference, I am 52 and 128 lbs at this time."

"2.0","Its was uncomfortable and it showed large gap under my arms, right where my fat poked out.","Despite a few removable stitches by my seamstress sister they remained.","Wont rent again."
"2.0","This dress is cute online but in person the material is shiny with more bold stripes and NO STRECH at all.","To the point where I was unable to move or sit down in this dress.","I was going to wear it to dinner with my fiance and his family, but there was no way it would would work.","If youre interested in this dress Id say order at least 2 sizes larger.","But even then, since theres no stretch, it might hang and bag."

"2.0","Dont rent this if youre actually a size 0.","The dress was huge the 0 fit like it was a size 4.","I didnt have time to swap it out so I wore it and tried taping it up.","Super uncomfortable all night.","Along with that it was too worn and frayed looking the lace scalloped ends were pilling and turned white.","Overall I was very unimpressed on this one.","On the plus side its a nice red color and nice length for me (Im 51)."
"2.0","Collar was too long."
"2.0","I know they say DVF wrap dresses are great on every figure - but thats a crock.","This was my third attempt at finding a good one and it was as much as failure as my last two tries.","The belt never hits me at the right spot, so I look even shorter than usual and it emphasizes my belly pooch.","Hard pass."

"2.0","At 5 months pregnant, I was thrilled to find such a gorgeous dress that fit perfectly over my bump, however 5 girls tried to get it to zip for me and the zipper was simply stuck midway.","It had nothing to do with the fit, there was plenty of material, but the zipper simply would not go up.","Thank Goodness I had a second dress of my own in my bag or I would have had nothing to wear.","RTR needs to fix the zipper and then it will be a great dress."

"2.0","I rented this dress in a 0R and a 2R for my law school prom, and unfortunately neither size fit.","In RTR dresses I typically wear a 2, and sometimes a 0, but the 0 was huge.","The bust was so big there was no way it was going to stay up and the dress was about four inches too long, even with 2.5 inch heels on.","After a few gown-type rentals, I have learned that the long dresses on RTR are a stretch if youre 55 like me and I plan to stick with only short dresses in the future.","The color was gorgeous though, so if you have a large chest and are pretty tall, this is the dress for you."

"2.0","I absolutely LOVED this dress on.","It was so cute.","I was comfortable.","I ordered an 8 and a 10.","I had room in the 10, but ended up wearing that one bc it was more comfortable.","Something seemed off with the zipper, like it wasnt zipping and unzipping right even when it was off me, but I was still able to make it work so I wore it.","So off I go to the wedding.","Im there awhile, and all of a sudden, my zipper started separating.","My husband was able to get it zipped back up.","Thank goodness.","Then, it happens again.","Same thing... By the third time we couldnt get it back up, and a seamstress at the wedding site actually had to SEW ME INTO THE DRESS!!","How embarrassing!!!","Once she did that I was good to go for the rest of the night, and I was able to pull the dress over my head to get it off at later that night.","Despite my bad experience, RTR was AMAZING!!","They fully refunded my purchase, and apologized for what happened.","Ladies, if something seems off with a zipper, contact RTR right away before you wear the dress and see what they can do.","Their customer service is outstanding!"
"2.0","way too big and long"
"2.0","The dress is beautiful, but the sizes are weird...I tried on the 8 and my back was showing in a very unflattering way, then the 10 is okay in the back but the tummy area is too big."
"2.0","This is a beautiful gown, but sadly, the sizes I ordered made me feel like a stuffed sausage.","I received the size 2R and 4R.","The 4R was the size that fit the best, however, it runs pretty small through the waist and hips, so on someone like me who has a small bust (34A), it REALLY draws attention to your lower half if it doesnt fit correctly.","Also, I found the length to be entirely too short.","Not wearing heels, you could see my feet sticking out from under the gown, and in a modest heel (close to 3), it just looked ridiculous.","If I had to pick this gown again, I would definitely go up to at least the 6 or possibly the 8 (even though I would have to pad my bust significantly to get those sizes to work), and definitely select the long length.","RTR is awesome though, and my back up dress should be on my porch tonight.","Fingers crossed!","Thanks, RTR!"
"2.0","The dress is beautiful."
"2.0","ALL MY 6 FOOT LADIES - Do NOT waste your time/money.","This does NOT fit our tall bodies.","I had high hopes that it would - especially with it being strapless, I thought it would be a bit more lengthy in the torso area.","It wont cover your breasts and your stay out of your booty - there isnt enough material.","Huge bummer :("
"2.0","Zipper of 6 was broken, I fixed it!","Clip of 4 is still broken."
"2.0","The dress had never been worn when it arrived with price tag attached.","You would think this would be a good thing, but material for the skirt was too puffy.","I like body to a skirt...but it was puffier than the brides ball gown wedding dress :/ The material was very itchy...I guess I dont like things with sequins..because they itched really bad around the arm holes.","It was also kind of big around the waist for a size 4.","Overall fit was not great, the material is nice but it is also super heavy."
"2.0","The slip underneath seemed to be lower than the skirt.","The top was oddly tight"
"2.0","This was HUGE on me.","That color is also a bit more mauve than the photo, and I have fair skin, so it really washed me out.","I would not recommend it for anyone who is not over 54 and tan!"
"2.0","If you wear a 34D, you will not fit into this dress.","Its made for small chests.","I rented a 6 and a 8.","Im 57, 150LBs, 34D.","The 6 fit everywhere but did not zip up around my bust.","8 still didnt zip at the bust and was huge in the waist.","I didnt wear it.","Plus the tulle bottom made me look like I was in a costume.","This dress felt like a costume, not classy.","Very disappointed."

"2.0","I wanted to wear this and look like a fairy but instead I looked like a Russian Grandmother.","No offense to any Russian Grandmothers out there on Rent the Runway!","It was extremely long, I am 53 and it went down to my ankles.","I wanted this to be more of a midi but it just wasnt.","Lots of material but better for someone tall!"
"2.0","This dress is nice but not meant for plus size.","I wear a size 20 and I could not even get into the 22.","Way to tight and short.","I really wanted to love this dress and was sad I could not wear this one.","Luckily, RTR has fabulous service and I was abloe to get another dress sent last minute"
"2.0","I was overall very disappointed with the fit and style of this dress.","It appeared very lightweight and airy on the website, but once it arrived, it was very dated and heavy."
"2.0","This dress underwhelmed me and it wasnt as well made as I had hoped.","I dont consider myself to be a hippy person (which is why I thought the dress would work), but as you can see from the photo it pulled in all the wrong places.",":( I am really glad I ordered an extra size up (44)...I would not have been able to wear the 42 (aka 6, my usual size).","One thing Ive learned from this is try on the dress THE MINUTE it arrives.","I waited until I was getting dressed for the event, and by then it was too late to find something else.","Net: while this looks like a dress that should compliment many age groups, my take is that it is a younger womans dress."
"2.0","I was unable to wear this dress because it was way too large.","It was a lovely color, but I had to send it back unworn.","I have usually worn a 14 in RTR fashions, but I think even a 12 might have been too large."
"2.0","The dress for beautifully, it was not tight or snug but very well tailored for my form.","I leaned over and the zipper split!","I rezipped it and it didnt happen again for a few squats and movements then it split.","Really annoying and I ended up wearing another dress I had laying around.","Unusual for RTR to have an issue like this."
"2.0","Overall this jacket was way too large and an unflattering cut/fit.","The sleeves were too long and the body part of the jacket was boxy and also ill fitting.","I recieved a size small and the porportions didnt look right at all.","I wished it had worked, the jacket looked so great online and wouldve been a great Fall wardrobe addition."
"2.0","I couldnt lift up my arms."
"2.0","I usually wear a size 18 or 20.","I ordered the 20 and 22 to be on the safe side as others said it ran small.","The 20 I couldnt even get on.","The 22 barely fit.","It made chest flat as a pancake.","This dress would be perfect for someone with big boobs and no butt.","Its more Rose Gold than yellow.","And its VERY short.","Im 56, not considered tall and this felt like a mini dress.","This was my first rental, a very disappointing experience.","Luckily my last minute emergency dress shopping spree was successful."
"2.0","Very pretty dress.","I went up 2 sizes and it still didnt fit.","First bummer RTR dress:( Disappointed."
"2.0","The dress was beautiful, however it did not fit in the chest (too small)."
"2.0","If you have supple boobs first off--Congrats!!","Second off--go up one size in this dress!","It flattened me out completely and it looked like a uniboob because the cut is so narrow up top.","It was actually so small I couldnt snap it in so ladies go up a size if you have big girls!"
"2.0","... flattened out a big chest.","weird neck clasp.","cant wear a bra.","no good."
"2.0","I didnt even wear this dress as it was A. too short and B. the fit was awkward and uncomfortable.","The material is really thick and stiff too."
"2.0","I am normally a size four but this dress fit very large in the bust area (I have a wide ribcage as well) - Also the waist area was not flattering - I tried to belt it but there was too much fabric.","The photo makes the dress look more like a knit but it is not.","If I ordered this dress again I would definitely size down."
"2.0","I initially ordered this dress for my bachelorette party and wasnt exactly pleased with the fit or the comfort.","I am a small size 6 so I figured if I ordered a 6, the dress wouldnt be too tight.","I was quite wrong.","The dress hung from my chest and was so tight that I could barely sit down.","Also, the sequins on the hem of the dress were very uncomfortable, as they were scratching against my skin.","In order to pull off this dress, you need a very small frame with a very large chest.","In other words, you need to look exactly like the model.","Its a shame because the dress is stunning, but a very awkward fit."
"2.0","The dress fit fine though the cut of the lace on the breast area was somewhat unflattering as Im quite large.","Overall, I didnt really consider wearing the dress once I saw it.","The lace is really cheap looking like something from a low-end teen retail store."
"2.0","Basically a sweatshirt.","Looks cheap and sloppy"
"2.0","It showed off a little too much skin for my taste.","I have a small chest and would have had to use fashion tape to avoid showing too much.","The slit up the side would have been fine on its own, but the event didnt warrant showing off both chest and legs."
"2.0","Thankfully this was my second option.","The sleeves were awkward.","I tried it on first as i was hoping the first option worked, which it did and I was very happy about."
"2.0","Didnt work for me..."
"2.0","The dress, on the model, is beautiful.","My best friend  who is 59 tried it on and it was great on her too.","Im a short girl, 54 and this dress is definitely designed for someone taller with a longer waist.","I was sort of swallowed up by this dress and it didnt give me any real shape.","I tried my backup dress on, and the size wasnt the problem, it really was the cut of the dress.","Ive been pleased with other rentals from rent the runway, but this one just didnt work.","Sadly, by the time I realized that the dress wasnt going to work, there was no time to return it to RTR in time to get another dress."
"2.0","The fit is really odd.","Im not sure what type of body this would look good on but if you have curvy hips beware."
"2.0","very loose, box shaped, would have been cute with skinny jeans for black pants for work."
"2.0","I was not able to wear it to the event because it was just too big.","I usually wear a 6 or an 8, but i definitely could have fit into a 4, if not smaller."
"2.0","This dress looks super cute on the RTR website and many ladies had success with this dress.","I am a full chested lady and this made the dress even shorter!","I am only 51 and did not feel comfortable with the length and unfortunately did not wear the dress."
"2.0","I ordered a 0 in this dress and it was HUGE.","Did not wear.","I am 52, 105 pounds.","I usually wear a 0 or 2"
"2.0","Straps were way too long and the lining of the dress made it seem old fashioned."
"2.0","This is a beautiful dress.. it runs really large!","I am 58 137 and the size 4 reg was so big I could not wear it.","I probably needed a zero which is kind of silly vanity sizing.","I am not ever  wearing anything smaller than a 4."
"2.0","I dont recommend this dress as its hard to get on ( no zipper) also, the beads snag on EVERYTHING... As in your HAIR.","The dress itself is very pretty but the beading is just not worth it in my opinion."
"2.0","I felt like this dress wasnt right for what I was looking for.","I feel this dress has a Mexican flair to it, like I just needed a flower in my hair and id be set."
"2.0","I had to go out and shop like a crazy person last minute because I could not wear the dress because the top was SO LARGE you could not even pin it.","It is a beautiful dress but the top is completely not portioned well."
"2.0","I was looking forward to wearing this dress to my graduation, but it just didnt fit right.","The fabric was very thick and stretchy and it reminded me of neoprene wetsuit material.","There are no zippers, so it is difficult to put on and take off.","I ended up going with another RTR dress."
"2.0","Definitely for winter.","I really didnt like it.","It was just too dark, too long and too tight."
"2.0","This dress runs incredibly small, Im typically an XS, ordered a Small (The Medium was not instock as a second option) The small was so small that I ended up not being able to wear it to the event."
"2.0","It just did not fit my body type.","Really disappointed."
"2.0","Not flattering, boxy, odd leg length (neither full nor ankle)."
"2.0","I actually returned it and didnt wear it, sadly.","A tad tight in waist for me and didnt love it on me.","Lucky though, as another guest at the party had same dress on in a print (looked better on her anyway)."
"2.0","The outfit is made for a long lean body type.","It was also very heavy as while it has no sleeves it feels like a winter outfit."
"2.0","I rented the six knowing the four would have worked best but wasnt available.","The dress fit but the chest of the six was WAY too big.","Regardless of fit, I dont know if a bra/support is possible in this dress with the low front and back and would only recommend it to ladies who dont need support in the chest area."
"2.0","The color is adorable, and the cut of the body of the dress is very cute.","However, the top portion makes the dress completely unwearable.","The straps are incredibly awkward, making the armpit region look very chubby.","Also, even with a modest 34B bust, there is a lot of potential for sideboob (not the tasteful kind) in this dress, given that the straps are overly long.","I ended up having to wear a different dress."
"2.0","I should have ordered a size up on this dress."
"2.0","Im normally a 10, but got both a 10 & 12.","Both fit fine in the skirt and top, except for the band around the waist.","It ran way too tight in both sizes, and made the dress completely uncomfortable and unwearable."
"2.0","The dress fit like a glove...except for in the chest.","This is not for someone with a large cup size.","It was way too revealing.","Very sad I had to use a dress I had for my holiday party :/ Rent the runway was great at giving me credit for the dress though."
"2.0","This dress is really pretty but the top part is so scratchy and tight that I couldnt wear it.","I was going to my best friends wedding and I wanted to be able to dance - would have been impossible to raise my arms in this dress.","And in 90 degree humid heat, I would have been so uncomfortable."
"2.0","I love Herve Leger and this is the first HL that has been a total disappointment for me.","The arm holes are ridiculous.","Dont  even bother with this dress."
"2.0","I wouldnt have even needed to bend over for someone to see my butt.","If anyone even walked by and lightly brushed against me there are all my parts to be seen, I like short dresses but this was border lining on being a long shirt!!!","!"
"2.0","Im a nursing mom, so my chest is some what large compared to the rest of my body right now.","But I usually wear a 00/0 and the 2 wouldnt even come close to closing, I think I would have needed an 8."
"2.0","didnt wear - it shed too much on my pants"
"2.0","I ordered a 10 but it fit like a size 4.","I couldnt even zip it up."
"2.0","It ran too small.","I am a petite woman and my butt cheeks were hanging out- not cute."
"2.0","I rented this for a bridal shower.","It was a good thing I bought a back up dress.","It is completely open down the front with a closure near the chest and a snap near the waste.","Below the waste, the only thing keeping this dress closed was the waste wrap.","I felt like if the wind blew I was going to be showing off a lot more than I wanted to.","I wouldnt rent this again."
"2.0","I am a size 8 in almost everything.","The size 10 wouldnt even go past my butt ... didnt get to wear either of the sizes."
"2.0","I was planning on wearing this to a Cirque show in Vegas, but it was see through too high on the bottom.","I was not interested in being a show in Vegas, so I opted for another dress."
"2.0","Im usually a size 10 and this certainly ran small which was a shame because it is such a beautiful dress.","It looks expensive and would have made me stand out for sure!","If you have big breasts, certainly size up!"
"2.0","Cute concept, but the fit was a disaster.","There is lots of fabric along the bust and at the hips.","Im a waif of a human being and the 0 was massive on me.","I dont recommend for small, petite women."
"2.0","Pros - Material flows nicely Cons - Huge and not true to size."
"2.0","The dress does not look the way it does on the site.","In person, the material looks very cheap, and can easily get caught in your jewelry.","Would not recommend"
"2.0","Not at all worth the rent!","The lace is painful and extremely stiff and itchy!"
"2.0","Very short if you are a taller person, would probably work best on someone who is shorter :)"
"2.0","I thought this dress would be more forgiving or flowy but it had a tight, narrow lining that made it bunch in the waist and pull in the hips.","The chest area also was a very weird fit.","My boobs didnt actually fall within the chest area completely as theres no structure to the dress and you cant really wear a bra with it.","Would be a good over a bathing suit maxi for someone without curves or boobs that sit perfectly straight and dont fall off to the side!"
"2.0","Dress was too short and ill fitting around the waist.","However my experience with RTR was once again amazing.","I was able to run down to the showroom and get assistance with finding a new dress the same day!"
"2.0","It had a tear in the gown in the back and had been worn a few too many times.","Great look but was more of pain than it was worth.","Rented the 4L, should have gone for the 2L."
"2.0","I ordered the long size, and it was still WAY too short.","Did not wear."
"2.0","The dress is gorgeous, but unfortunately I wasnt able to wear it as a Regular was at least 5 inches too short.","I wouldve ordered a Long one if that was an option but it wasnt.","I dont even think a size 8 or 10 would be long enough, and Im only 58/59.","Only order this if youre super short!"
"2.0","The material is beautiful, but the dress didnt compliment my body shape.","The high waistline downplayed my chest and accentuated my hips.","I look better in something that does the opposite."
"2.0","I fell in love with this dress and was waiting for the right event to rent.","It was way to short.","I am 54 and even the six was incredibly short.","I could not wear it, had to return.","I was so bummed."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress, the cut was terrible on me.","I went to the NYC RTR store and the staff was helpful in picking me a new Shoshanna dress to wear for the wedding that day."
"2.0","I was nervous about this dress from the second I reserved it.","I put it on and almost instantly sent an email to RTR that I would be returning it.","The top was baggy (even in the size 2), the peplum hit me in a weird place, and the bottom half just didnt look right.","I have a post baby body so my lower half is a little larger then my top but even the top I was surprised at the fit.","RTR was amazing and Hanna got back to me right away and overnighted another dress to me.","Although this dress was a disappointment, RTR experience was an A+!"
"2.0","Bad fit and color was off"
"2.0","This dress is too, too small.","If I had someone to zip it up for me- it doesnt give enough  cleavage in the front to justify all the bandage style of the dress.","I did not wear it, and normally I love Herve Leger"
"2.0","I rented as part of unlimited to wear for work - put it on and really hated it... looked like I was either joining the circus or hiding a baby bump.","Ran narrow in the shoulders, it was shorter than expected.","Will not be renting this one again..."
"2.0","Did not fit way too small"
"2.0","Snug snug snug."
"2.0","First, I didnt wear the dress.","There were no other reviews available when I rented and both dress still had the tags.","I normally wear size 0 or 2, but even the 0 was enormous.","I understand that its a shift dress, but it really just hangs with no shape at all.","I felt like a triangle.","I even tried to cinch the waist with a belt, but there was too much material that bunched together so it looked very odd-like I was a child playing in a big sisters dress!","The only positives of the dress (for me) were the color and the black lace on the shoulders.","The blue is beautiful-one reason I wanted to rent it.","This may be a good option for someone that is able to go down a couple sizes OR as is if you want to wear it to smuggle large items under it!","!"
"2.0","I ordered this dress for prom thinking it was almost bedazzled and tight fitting, but it wasnt.","It arrived 2 days before prom and it was all sequins.","I tried it on and it was baggy around the waist and made me look boxy.","I was unimpressed by this dress.","Thank goodness I got another dress overnight shipped to me.","It was a completely different dress, but it turned out to fit perfectly!","I dont reccomend wearing this if you have a small waist.","Mine is 24 and it probably couldve fit a 32 waist.","Not impressed with this dress"
"2.0","The fit was not good.","Neither of the sizes fit correctly.","The 8 shoulders fit weird.","I had trouble with moving my arms up and down.","It was like something in the lining wasnt correct.","The 10 was too big and I couldnt wear it because the shoulders would fall off.","I was very dissatisfied with the dress.","The dress got to me o time.","That was a plus but I couldnt wear it."
"2.0","The dress is pretty, but not for me.","It runs large and fit baggy.","I didnt end up wearing this dress."
"2.0","I will be the first to admit that I do not have the skinniest arms, then again, they arent that beefy either.","The only reason I did not wear this dress is because I could not pull the sleeves up.","I was able to pull them  up to my shoulders, but not over them.","Ive never had this issue before with any top."
"2.0","I loved the way it looked and it was stretchy but the material was cheap and the tiny sequins were hanging off in several areas.","I still would have worn it but the clear nylon threads that held the sequins on kept poking me and I just couldnt spend an evening out being so uncomfortable.","Aargh, could have been a winner otherwise!"
"2.0","Im a curvy girl--as in I have an hourglass figure, not that Im plus sized--and this dress is NOT the look for my body type.","if you have a booty and boobs, youll look like a giant rectangle since this dress doesnt pinch in at the waist at all.","Its better suited for boyish bodies so that the garment can sort of hover around the body, because when it clings, its not good!"
"2.0","It looked frumpy on because the fabric was so thick.","It was on my body for :60 seconds before going back in the return bag."
"2.0","I was able to zip it up but considering I have rented another dress by the same designer, I was surprised at how small this dress ran.","I do have a rather large chest (36DDD) but the dress was super tight and I couldnt wear it :("
"2.0","was not flattering on my hourglass figure, and looked like too much material on the top."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","I thought it was going to be a nice printed, shiny material; but it was actually more of a graphic print dress and not appropriate for an evening wedding.","Its also a bit darker than in the photo.","It is an open-back dress, so I could have worn a smaller size since the chest isnt tight.","The cut is ok, but its not a pretty as I thought it would be."
"2.0","I was very disappointed, first of all  I wear size 14 since I like the dresses not to tight so I am between 12 and 14 but since I read the review s I ordered 16 and 14.","Needless to say both were to small and had to return it.","Thank God I had back up plans although when I called the lady that answered the phone offered to overbite another dress.","One other thing about this dress it was too worn out .","Looked like it has been  worn too many times."
"2.0","It fit so oddly in the chest area!","I was literally freaking out when I was getting ready for the wedding because the chest area was waaay too big and the sticking made it look like I had an extra folds.","I fit a size 2 perfectly, all the time usually, but it wasnt the case for this.","My girls came to the rescue and we were trying to figure out a ton of solutions and tried many until one worked -- wearing two bras -- which kind of helped smooth the areas over, but the folds were still pretty visible.","Also, it is a little tight on the arms irritating my skin."
"2.0","This dress is beautiful, unfortunately, the zipper is actually impossible.","So much so that I had to safety pin it because 5 people couldnt get it to zip.","It is not worth it unfortunately!"
"2.0","I loved the dress, and was very excited to have it to wear for my rehearsal dinner, but in the end it was way to short to be appropriate.","Unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to wearing it!"
"2.0","I have worn Badgley Mischka in the past with no issue but when I rented the same size I typically do, it was much smaller and I had to send it back without wearing it.","It is very tight across the shoulders/armpits and even the Long length looks short with heels.","Not my favorite piece!"
"2.0","The material was very heavy and extremely tight even for the large.","I was unable to wear this dress because it was not comfortable."
"2.0","This dress looks sophisticated in the photo but in person is shapeless and not flattering.","Also, it runs very big.","Luckily it was a backup rental; had it been the primary dress, it would have been disappointing."
"2.0","I thought it looked good on me at first, but then I realized it was not flattering.","Just didnt do anything for my shape.","The dress was made very well & had the top not flattened out my boobs, I would have worn it.","It fit everywhere else.","It just flattened my chest & made my boobs look lower on my body than they actually are.","I tried stuffing my strapless bra to the point I looked like a D, but the dress is just designed to detract from your chest.","Probably very flattering on someone with a D+ cup size.","I am a C.  I text a picture to my friend & she text me back where did your boobs go?","...Going with my backup dress as my backup dress.","I just spent the past 2 hours steaming my dress from last year.","I am HOPING that no one realizes Im wearing the same dress again.","If I feel to self conscious Ill wear my back up dress, but it really isnt formal enough.","This wont make me give up on RTR, too many good rental experiences & Im a PRO member!","!"
"2.0","I did not like the fit of this dress.","I almost always wear a size 4, and in this dress, it felt like I was wear a Catholic Sisters habit.","I do dress conservatively for work, this was too frumpy even for the office.","Returned without wearing."
"2.0","Too tight.","Unflattering."
"2.0","The sleeves were so oddly tight, I literally couldnt even get the blouse on.","My arms are not abnormally large in any way shape or form."
"2.0","No stretch to this dress and sequins are very itchy!","Best for slim or athletic body frames.","Did not work well on my short torso curvy build.","Dress was  not worn for event."
"2.0","If youre a true size 0, this dress is large and frumpy.","Would never recommend."
"2.0","Although this looked stylish on the women pictured it looked like a tent on me!","Even belted, there is just too much fabric.","I ended up not wearing this piece it at all."
"2.0","So I didnt get a backup of this dress because it looked online like I would be charged extra for the backup.","This was small enough that I couldnt zip it up and it was unwearable."

"2.0","SMELLS DO NOT RENT"
"2.0","Amazing quality and the fabric is so comfortable.","I wanted to sleep in it!","But it looked like a nightgown.","Completely unflattering, and too short to wear a belt with it."
"2.0","Of all the dresses I have rented this may have been my least favorite simply due to the fabric.","Didnt feel like a well made dress but rather flimsy.","Didnt wear it."
"2.0","It was very tight, I couldnt wear a bra when trying it on.","The length fit like a petite gown, and the arms were too short as well."
"2.0","Great idea for a dress but poorly executed on the design side for fit, function, and flattering the body.","I think some girls in the reviews made a great attempt at trying to make this dress work.","Better than I could, for sure.","However, I would save your money and go with something different.","I decided not to wear and sent back."
"2.0","Tight around bust area..","They didnt have the bigger size so only ordered the one.","Bummer.."
"2.0","Too short for me to wear.","I am not very tall (5 2 and this was too short for comfort in public).","The length surprised me as the dress otherwise looks sweet."
"2.0","The dress I rented was different than what they gave me.","Same designer, same print but a completely different style.","The dress in the picture/what I rented had a V neck with a full skirt.","What I received was a crew neck with a PLEAT skirt.","Still a beautiful dress but I cant stand pleats.","Very disappointing."
"2.0","I am 56 and the large was way too short to wear out in public."
"2.0","This was my first choice rental for a wedding, but it looked awful on me.","I guess Im in the minority here because I ordered my regular size (4) and 6 as a backup as most indicated that the dress runs small.","I was basically swimming in the dress (super baggy in the chest and gaping near my waist) and it hit me at an awkward length.","I wanted to love this dress, but it really wasnt for me at all."
"2.0","The length way too long, the fit is bulky, pretty much big everywhere"
"2.0","I was going to wear this dress but decided to return.","I am usually a size small but this one seems to run on the smaller side and fabric wasnt stretchy."
"2.0","I was disappointed because I was looking forward to waering this dress.","The arm holes were strange.","Just overall a very weird fit."
"2.0","Although the dress was absolutely stunning, I have to give RTR a low rating due to my first experience.","I selected a medium and large dress size for a wedding I planned to attend.","I received both dress on schedule a day before the event.","After taking the medium out of the bag I noticed a hole on the side of the dress, when I turned the dress inside out, I was shocked to see, someone tried to fix the hole by using a safety pin.","I immediately called RTR and they didnt seem concerned about what I was experiencing.","The customer service rep offered to ship another dress however it wouldnt arrive within time for the event, she then offered 15% off my next order.","Considering this was my first time ordering through them, Im not confident I would ever use them again.","Plus there was a 20% off coupon in the garment bag.","Because of the tight timeline on finding another dress, I was forced to wear the large, which worked out well, however was slightly big in the top and around the knee.","I feel like the medium would have worked better, however I wasnt given the opportunity to wear it because RTR sent it damaged.","With all that said, the dress was beautiful, I received several compliments throughout the night.","Seems they are a bit too cocky for me, so not sure I would use them again due to the bad service.","Hope you have better luck than I did."
"2.0","Overall, it fit very small.","I ordered a 8R and a 10R just in case.","The 8R was very small and I had a hard time getting it over my hips.","Once I got it on, the top was very exposed and I didnt feel comfortable.","I tried on the 10R and was unable to squeeze it over my hips at all.","I am very disappointed in this product."
"2.0","dress looked a little shabby and fit of fabric was not flattering.","had to do an emergency swap out unfortunately."
"2.0","After a dress I had ordered was not available, RTR overnighted this dress to me as a courtesy backup.","Print is much prettier in person.","Unfortunately the dress was HUMUNGOUS and there was no way I could make it work without swimming in it.","I ordered another dress for a wedding I was attending."
"2.0","As a tall girl, it is hard to find rompers that fit, though a few have worked for me.","The length on this was fine (shorts not crazy short and no bunching/pulling around the crotch), but I found the fit very unflattering for someone without an hourglass shape.","The M fit well objectively (not too small, not too big), and I am usually around a 6, but the combination of where the waistline hit and the large pattern made me look much larger than I would like.","While other belted/gathered rompers can be slimming, this had a very opposite effect.","Did not wear and generally wouldnt recommend for women with a straight & narrow body type."
"2.0","It is not the same material as presented in the description.","It is not a jersey material, it is a Body-Con fit.","There is no open part in the back of the dress.","Was not flattering on."
"2.0","This top was very boxy, ran large and looked very weathered - i didnt even wear it out.","I would not recommend this for anyone with a larger chest."
"2.0","NOT FOR SMAL GIRLS... MAKE YOU LOOK BIGGER"
"2.0","Great quality dress, wish I could have worn it!"

"2.0","Even though I used the sizing chart, I wasnt able to wear this dress because it was too loose.","Luckily a great stylist was able to get me a replacement dress just in time for my event!"
"2.0","My chest size is a 34B and the 6 was too tight.","So disappointing since its a really pretty dress."
"2.0","Material is really heavy.","Even size zero is  too big on me.","Does not look fancy like the photo looks.","Its a bit different.","I would not recommend this dress"
"2.0","Best customer service!!","This was sent to me because they did not have the back up size I needed in another dress.","This dress, however, was cringeworthy.","Just a lot of material and made me look huge.","I just had a baby so my tummy is not toned and this did not help flatter me."
"2.0","Unfortunately.","it wasnt what I expected.","It was NOT long enough even though I ordered the long.","I was going to wear the 6L since that is my size but I chose to wear the 8L since I would have slightly better length.","It was short even without shoes!","i like my formal gowns to tough the floor or at least be ankle length.","This was not the case.","On a postive note, the material was nice and it hugged in the right areas."
"2.0","This was a very cute dress.","The material was some scuba material that just did not go well with me and my style.","It is very cute dress and looked great on my friend when she tried it on.","I was just a bit weird for my tastes"
"2.0","I assume you have to go down numerous sizes to make this dress look somewhat flattering.","It was huge throughout, but on a plus size, it does make your chest look larger than it might actually be ;)"
"2.0","The rented both a size 8 and size 10 as I have never gone wrong in renting either size from RTR in the past.","I tried them both on to determine which one I would be wearing to a destination wedding and both were ill fitting.","The size 8 was too tight on my hips, yet had buldging fabric around my waist which the pleating on the sides of the dress did not help.","I tried the size 10, which fit the hips, but again there was buldging fabric at the waist.","Very disappointed with this dress, as I have rented 3 dresses with RTR before with no issues."
"2.0","This dress runs so small i could not wear it."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress but I liked the look of it.","The back gapped to the point where it fell off my shoulders and was unwearable."
"2.0","The fit in the waste was perfect.","However, the top was huge and fit horribly.","There isnt enough tape to help hold it up and it cuts way to low to wear a bra.","Probably perfect for the 59 size A super model - and for that I say you go girl this will be amazing in on you."
"2.0","I was not at all happy with the style of this dress.","I thought the color combinations and the materials were cheap looking.","I have rented from RTR a few times before this and always loved my gowns so I was super sad not to have any desire to wear this dress."
"2.0","Sorry I didnt take a picture but this dress made me look like and OLD lady and Im only 23.","I got it as a back up dress for a company award party and thank goodness my first choice fit because this dress really aged me.","I did like the fabric, it was very giving and the length was great for a work affair (right above the knee on me).","If you get this dress make sure you get a back up though in case you hate it like I did!"
"2.0","Ordered a 2 - Id say their 2 is a normal size 6.","I am also 55 and these were very long.","Could not wear them.","I absolutely would not recommend."
"2.0","I didnt wear this dress to my event because the bodice was too tight but the dress poffed out wayyy to much.","I looked like a large bell.","It was awful and since they didnt have a backup size to send me I  had no other option but to wear something I already had.","It was a disaster and I was really mad Id spent so much money on it.","What a waste."
"2.0","The arms were too tight in the 6 and the size 8 was too big.","Overall, the dress hit well below my knees (Im pushing 52).","Also, the pockets hit right at my widest point so was not very flattering.","Was a beautiful color but would be better for a tall, leaner person!"
"2.0","Its a beautiful dress, but runs pretty large.","I borrowed a 6 and an 8, two of the sizes I wear most often.","Maybe Im just smaller than I realize and couldve pulled off the 4, but the open back made it hard to keep the front from slipping off my shoulders."
"2.0","Beautiful dress but way to tight over the chest so I didnt get to wear it"
"2.0","I didnt wear this dress, but unfortunately as I got this delivered to my office the previous day and worked late, I didnt have the opportunity to try it on within the return window.","It was very disappointing, especially as it seemed the size 6 had a zipper defect in that it wasnt sitting right on my hip (like, it would pop out and you could tell there was a zipper there).","I rented this to go to the Belmont Stakes- I was looking for a summery day dress.","Fortunately I had an alternative in my closet.","I wouldnt recommend this dress as its designed to hug the skin, which isnt apparent in the photo.","Its unlined, and I was expecting nicer fabric.","I dont think I would have been comfy all day in this.","However, the colors are beautiful, and it looks terrific on the hanger.","If you are looking for a tight dress, you might like it."
"2.0","Usually a 16W runs large on me - I couldnt even zip this up.","Not at all a good fit."
"2.0","Really small on the chest"
"2.0","It was way too low cut!!","I didn’t even wear it!","!"
"2.0","Didnt like the fit at all, or color, overall just not a good shirt, especially for my body type."
"2.0","The fit was terrible on me... big in the top overall (including sleeves).","Even if it had fit, it was very matronly - definitely not a hott showstopper."
"2.0","Loved the way this dress looked on the model AND me, but it was a wool dress that was unlined, so it was so itchy I couldnt wear it.","The hem was also unfinished, which made it look cheap.","I was disappointed in the quality for such an expensive dress.","I returned it without wearing, but RentTheRunway is refunding the cost, so I can try them again the next time I need that it outfit."
"2.0","Although the fabric and material of the dress is nice, I wouldnt recommend this dress for those with a muscular or boarder shoulders.","Because the dress has a cap-like shoulder style, it doesnt look as good as those with smaller shoulders."
"2.0","The fit was boxy and not as form flattering as in the picture.","Also, the lace and cut of the neckline seemed more matronly.","Would be appropriate for a funeral perhaps, but not what I wanted for date night.","I did not wear it, and ended up running out at the last minute to purchase something new to wear."
"2.0","im hardly voluptuous but this dress made me look awful.","if you have any chest avoid this dress, it might be cute on very small, thin girls but thats about it.","the fabric is very thick too - i was going to wear it to a summer wedding and i think it would be miserable above 70..   i returned this immediately."
"2.0","The top runs very small."
"2.0","I read the other reviews of this outfit that said your butt will hang out in the back and its unwearable and I thought but its my bachelorette in Las Vegas, my butt is not very big and Im getting a spray tan, it will be fine!","I was wrong, all the other reviews are right.","The back of this romper is smaller than any bathing suit I own.","In my mind I was Jennifer Lopez dancing on stage for In Living Color, in reality it’s a good thing I didnt leave the house.","Pros: The front is beautiful!","I’d imagine if I was much shorter I could maybe pull it off."
"2.0","This dress is VERY short.","I am 57 and it comes to my ankles and I got the LONG.","I am just going to put on my 4 inch shoes and own it anyway.","Maybe start a new trend??",":("
"2.0","I rented this for a formal dinner.","It was not what I thought it would be.","First, this dress fits really snug.","That would have been ok if it were easy to walk in.","For some reason, the material was REALLY staticy (is that a word?)","and clung to my legs.","Second, the adhesive around the top of the dress was peeling.","At first, I didnt know what it was that I found on my skin until I unzipped the dress and saw it all over the inside of the dress.","It was very disgusting.","I immediately called for a replacement."
"2.0","I am a 34C and per previous reviewers, sized up to have more room in the chest.","The hook/eye closure gaped widely and without it closed the front just draped open exposing my bra.","I tried to adjust it with fashion tape, but it still looked odd and baggy.","I didnt want to be preoccupied with the chest so unfortunately was unable to wear the dress- although the color was beautiful."
"2.0","This fit horribly and I could not work with it.","The waist was so short that the dress ballooned out at the bottom of my rib cage with material that was obviously cut for wide hips.","I tried pulling it down so that the hips were somewhere near my own, but it just sprang back up and looked ridiculous.","I would not recommend for anyone who does not have a short waist and full hips."
"2.0","The dress was a disappointment.","The zippers always have an issue zipping and the size twowas fine if the zipper was fine and I ended up wearing the 4 which was big on top.","Both dresses did not lay properly on the bottom and it seemed like their was too much fabric,So needless to say, it always looks better on the model and I was not happy with the end result.","I wore it because I didnt have a backup."
"2.0","This is a fabulous dress, but do not recommend for someone petite with a full bust (I am 5 1, 32 DD).","The neck line is more plunging than it appears on the model, and you cannot wear a bra without it showing in the front and back.","On me, the size 8R fit at the waist, but shoulders were too large so the straps fell off my shoulders.","I wasnt able to use the dress, but highly recommend for someone who can go without a bra and is tall to average height.","Wish it worked for me because the fabric is even more beautiful in person than the photo."
"2.0","I ordered this to bring with me on a trip to Florida.","I wear between a 12/14 normally but I am large chest (DD).","This was really tight across the chest but HUGE in the stomach area.","It looked like I was wearing a sparkly burlap top.","I was SO sad b/c in the photos, it looks light weight and perfect for warmer weather, but the fabric was thicker and stiff, not flowy at all.","It looked cute on smaller girls in the photos, but for me, not a good fit."
"2.0","Unable to wear to my event due to the dress being too short and the bust WAY too big (Im a DD and thats saying something).","So disappointed :("
"2.0","Cute... However- its difficult to put and off if youre alone.","#singlegirlprobs"
"2.0","Didnt wear - would not recommend."
"2.0","Really nice thick sweater - more like a jacket.","I would have enjoyed wearing this but it came in stained.","Also, it would have been too warm out to make use of it this week.","It is best for a cold Fall night."
"2.0","Rented this dress for a cocktail attire event.","I saw the reviews of it being small and expected to have issues with the bottom because Im very pear shaped.","I actually had issues with the top instead.","Along with the top being very small, the metal boning was sticking out and poking me.","If the dress had fit properly, I still wouldnt have been able to wear it due to the metal."
"2.0","I loved the pattern of this dress and that you could dress it up or down depending on your event.","That said, this dress did not work for my body.","Unfortunately it was unflattering due to my busy size.","Wish it had worked out though...."
"2.0","Ran very small, didnt fit like other Amanda Uprichard dresses I have worn.","I would have needed the M when I usually wear a S."
"2.0","This was pretty snug in the hip area!","Definitely needed the Spanx.","Pretty material & color combo, but not a flattering cut for my body."
"2.0","Just as another reviewer pointed out, if you have a curvier bottom half, this may not be the dress for you.","Although the top is flattering, the place where the bodice meets the skirt cuts higher on the waist, so if puffs out making one look very wide.","If you have a long torso, this dress can also make you look shorter than you really are.","Due to this, I didnt even wear the dress!"
"2.0","A bit odd that I had ordered a similar dress from the same designer and that ran big on me, however this particular dress was far too tight."
"2.0","I typically wear either a size 2 or 4, but this dress in size small was too tight to be worn comfortably.","I would recommend ordering a medium."
"2.0","Im normally a size 6 as the size 8 was still 2 sizes too small for my chest and Im not even well endowed.","Was un-usable for my engagement pictures, but it looks like others have had luck.","Just be weary with sizing."
"2.0","I wanted to like this dress SO badly, but it just did NOT work for my body type.","On a more pleasant note, this dress was very high-quality, which I was very happy about.","I am also very fair-skinned, and I was wearing this dress to a wedding, so, in terms of the color, I was very nervous that I would 1.)","look washed out and 2.)","the color would be too close to white--neither of which were true (however, dont judge the coloring based solely on this picture, as I had to enhance and brighten the image).","The biggest issue I had was with the back of this dress.","I dont know WHO the designer designed this dress for, but it was certainly NOT designed for me.","The dress fit me perfectly everywhere else, except for the back--not even fabric tape would hold it down (THATS how big the back was on me).","This was very upsetting to me because I wanted to put my hair in a nice, low bun to show off the back of the dress, but, instead, I had to keep my hair down, hoping it would actually COVER the back of the dress!","Since I wore this to a wedding, naturally, I was dancing, and the sleeves kept falling down--yes, the sleeves kept falling down--all because the darn back of the dress!","Now as much as Im complaining here, I didnt think this was a big deal because faced forward, the dress looked perfectly fine.","However, I then saw this picture of me, and I was SO upset!","If you can see through my arm, the ill-fitted back of the dress was now shifting to the front of the dress, due to the way I was posed (aka the classic skinny arm pose).","This was completely distorting not just the back of the dress, but now the front of the dress!","So, unfortunately, this was a not a successful dress for me, but I imagine if you have the body type for the dress, it would look killer on you!"
"2.0","I dd not like this dress at all.","it was very big and did nothing for my figure.","Made me feel very boxy"
"2.0","I couldnt get the zipper past my mid-back and the length was too short (Im 55) to wear with heels."
"2.0","So I didnt realize it till it was too late that I could call to exchange for a different dress the night before my party.","Im a size 14 and RTR sent a 14 and a 16, which was amazing!","Totally love that they do that!","I tried on the 14 and it just didnt fit, I tried on the 16 and it fit but the zipper was pulling and it was lumpy in places it places it shouldnt have been.","My mom who is a 10, tried on the 14 and it fit her the same way the 16 fit on me.","The next day was my graduation party and I needed something to wear and I found a cute dress, size 14 that actually fit a little loose on me.","I wish I could have worn this one because I loved the sequin design, but it made me look much more hippy than my figure and I think it made me look older than 26.","Next time, I know to pay for the extra days to rent and to read all the notes it comes with so I will contact renttherunway.com to send over a different dress."
"2.0","Beautiful dress, just very small fit on top."
"2.0","It was huge, it is more for a boxy shape"
"2.0","The overall fit was too small"
"2.0","The sequins are pretty, and it is a pretty color.","It looks like it worked for a lot of women, but it fit me all wrong.","I have a short torso, and this was too big on top, but tight on the bottom.","Also, the way the dress is cut, it makes a bulge around the belly."
"2.0","This dress is so pretty, but is not cut for tall girls.","The photo says the model is 5 9, but there must have been some serious shrinkage to the dress over the time its been in rotation.","I ordered a size up from my normal fit, and the bust/waist/hips fit beautifully, but the back of the dress barely covered my behind.","It immediately went back in the bag for a return and I made a panicked trip to Nordstroms to find a dress fancy enough to wear to a semi-formal wedding the next day."

"2.0","I really liked this dress and was excited when it came cuz it looked cute.","I ordered a size 6, which is my normal size.","For some reason, they sent me a size 8.","Either way,  I couldnt even get it on.","The material is super thick, so it has no give at all and when I pulled it over my head, I could get it to go over my butt or thighs.","I have worn numerous dresses from Rent the Runway and they have always been pretty true to size and I normally am able to do a 4 or a 6 just fine.","The fact that this one was a size 8 and I couldnt even get it on tells me that this dress runs REALLY SMALL.","If you want to order (which it is a very pretty dress), I suggest ordering 1 or ever 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.","On another note....Rent the Runway was very helpful when I called to tell them it didnt fit.","Their customer service is AMAZING."
"2.0","Was going to wear a shorter boucle  style jacket over it and the jacket couldnt even hide how saggy the dress was...very disappointed.","However, my last order from RTR was a beautiful dress that was just flawless with no complaints."
"2.0","Top fit fine but the regular length was just way too long for someone of my height."

"2.0","The neckline was more asymmetrical than shown in the picture.","It was also too large for me in the bust.","So, it drooped off of one shoulder so much that the dress was unwearable for me.","Fit fine in the waist, but was also long on my petite frame."
"2.0","Fit huge I didnt even wear it such a waste of money.","Beautiful dress"
"2.0","Couldnt even bear to take a photo of myself.","Im petite (53), perhaps it would look nice on someone who is tall and slender.","The skirt is really poufy."
"2.0","These pucker up in the front so it makes you look like you have a big belly!","Not at all flattering...very cute style though."
"2.0","Major pooch action, odd fit.","Really wanted to like it, but no thanks."
"2.0","This dress feels quality and feels flattering with the heaviness of the fabric, but the skirt poofs out awkwardly at the hips and made my pear shape look even more pear shape.","It also looks like it could be summery- its not.","Its definitely a fall/winter dress."
"2.0","So I ordered this dress for dinner, but it was way too short and them hem on the dress was completely unsewn so it looked awful.","I dont recommend this dress for a curvy girl!"
"2.0","This dress is extremely small and short.","I am 56 and I ordered up a size like most reviewers recommended.","However, I couldnt raise my hands, sit down, or bend over without the dress completely riding up.","The next size up would have been too large of a fit.","I ended up wearing another dress to the wedding.","Overall, I was very disappointed about the length."
"2.0","I ordered the XS ans Small for backup-- both were way too big.","The waist is not fitted at all, so it just kind of hangs.","Even the sleeves are super baggy,  Just weird fitting all-around."
"2.0","The back of the dress stuck out, it was just too big and ill fitting.","Everytime I danced or moved around a lot during the evening, the dress would shift so the zipper was working its way toward the front of the dress!","My girlfriend had to help turn the dress around for me in the ladies room and my husband kept trying to shift it back into midline evertime we stopped dancing!.","This made it uncomfortable the whole evening."
"2.0","I purchased this dress as a back up for a wedding.","I did not wear this this dress.","I rented a size 8, I am usually a 6 and it was tight through the bust line.","The dress fit nicely through the waist and the hips obviously are not a problem.","However the fabric is VERY thick and didnt fall right on me, made me look larger than I am.","Also the length was very  long on me, which is odd since I am 5 9.","The pattern of the fabric was very pretty but I did not like the dress on or how it  fit."
"2.0","I wore a size up and it was still too small.","I didnt even dance because I was worried that once I put my arms up the entire thing would come up.","I normally would of just worn one of my own dresses but this wedding was out of town and I did not pack anything fancy enough.","I did not feel beautiful or comfortable.","I was very very disappointed."
"2.0","Loved the print and quality of dress.","I usually wear a size 4 or 6.","The six was too small."
"2.0","The dress was beautiful, however I received it and the long was about 4 inches too short without heels.","When I rented it this style was new with no reviews, I see now I am not the only one who had this issue.","So, if you are short/average go for it!","But for tall girls try Nichole Miller, the only designer I have found that is long enough."
"2.0","Really disappointed that this happened again with RTW, I loved the dress, but there was a defect in the front of the dress.","Last time the dress I wanted to wear had a big stain on the front.","Please work to get your quality control improved on these dresses."
"2.0","The dress is made of thick but stretchy material.","You are not able to wear a bra with it, but the material isnt so thick that girls with darker nipples can wear it.","The cups are also just jersey and are very small for busty ladies (me a 34DD).","It ended up being a bit too much of a show for me."
"2.0","I am 5 9 and the dress was completely too short to even wear.","Glad it was my back up dress."
"2.0","I loved the look of this dress, but unfortunately the draping around the middle just did not fit and it most certainly did not flatter my figure.","It kind of hung there almost like a pouch or pocket.","No matter how I arranged it, I could not get it to look like the ruching in the photo and made me look like I was heavier than I was.","Reading the other reviews, I suspect that this isnt always the case and perhaps there is something about my body type that caused this.","Im sad, because up until this point Ive always been totally thrilled with the dresses I have ordered from Rent the Runway, but Ill definitely order again."
"2.0","I received this dress along with two others as a replacement when my original dress did not fit.","I did not end up wearing this dress either because despite being two sizes larger than my usual size, it was tight and ill-fitting.","Additionally, the panels of lace are very revealing.","The color was also more of a beige than a light pink as it appears in the picture.","Overall disappointed with the dress but delighted with customer service."
"2.0","The dress photographed well, however I couldnt breathe the entire night and the dress was just super itchy.","I would not recommend it."
"2.0","too tight around my bust."
"2.0","With pinning Im sure this dress would look amazing but as far as actual fit goes the top was enormous!","I cant imagine how anyone would actually fit into it.","Definitely a big disappointment and I would not recommend renting it."
"2.0","I usually wear a size 2-4 in Trina Turk, and I ordered the 4 because the 2 was not available.","It ran so large, long and boxy, I dont even think sizing down to the 2 would have worked for me!","Definitely not a dress for shorter girls- it came down past my knees, and the armholes were very long and open."
"2.0","I am short so the dress was pretty long, which i didnt mind.","The bust area was too big."
"2.0","Dress has an excess of fabric in the middle area - on a petite, this is in the thigh area... it looks like saddlebags in the worst part of the body possible!!","Too bad, the top part fit very well."
"2.0","The dress fit me very oddly, so I was unable to wear it.","It was very large on the top, while the bottom was a bit too tight!","Had to send back."
"2.0","8R was big in the bust."
"2.0","This dress did not work for me.","The material was somewhat drab; it felt light and very simple, unlike the many dresses Ive rented from RTR that are beautiful and stand out as the most striking in the room.","The flare in real life is not as wide as shown in the picture.","The dress is very black and does not pop.","My husband disliked the dress, saying it looked too goth.","The work at the neckline doesnt add back enough style.","It is somewhat delicate, making it hard to wear a necklace (as shown) with the dress because it pulls at the strings.","Having said all this, the 0R fit was true to size and fit well.","Overall, very conservative, will not give you the spotlight."
"2.0","runs large"
"2.0","The color and material are gorgeous and I love the hemline, but the neckline was SO LOW it was absolutely unwearable.","An inch or even half and inch higher cut would have made a world of difference.","I bought a specialy deep plunge bra to wear with the dress and it was visible.","The material is way to loose to wear without a bra.","The 2R fit as well but unfortunately the neckline was just as bad."
"2.0","I typically wear a size 6, but even when I sized up, the dress could not fit."
"2.0","Size up!","I got this in my size and while it fit it looked tight in my opinion.","Very pretty color though."
"2.0","I actually did not end up wearing this dress to the event I rented it for.","It was not a good fit and was very heavy on the bottom.","Would have been uncomfortable wearing it to the event."
"2.0","Did not like the fit.","Runs big"
"2.0","The top fit perfectly, but i am almost  57 and just couldnt get away with the length.","It was way too short- even to wear with heels."
"2.0","I rented this dress along with another one because I couldnt decide on pictures alone, Im glad I did!","My heart was set on this dress but I was disappointed with the heaviness and overall fit.","The dress is double lined and it made the dress feel bulky and heavy.","It also flares a bit on the hips and midsection, made me look like I had both instead of flattering my silhouette.","It was also longer then the picture depicts, Im 59 and it fell closer to mid knee, I think with a shorter fit that it would of been more my style.","The color was amazing and after seeing it on the hanger my girlfriend insisted I try it on of her, she agreed with my critique and said it looked like An old lady dress....lol not really the look I was going for.","LOVED the service of RTR though and the other dress I ordered (different designer) was PERFECT :)"
"2.0","The dress is very heavy, the torso is long, and it runs quite big.","Order a size down.","I didnt like the look.","I tried it on but went with another option."
"2.0","The length and hip area fit perfectly (52 with 3inch heels).","However, the shoulder part of the dress was too big; kept falling.","Also, if youre 34C+, the dress will make you look fat."
"2.0","The dress runs really small.","I am usually an 8 or a 10 and I couldnt even zip this dress in a size 12.","The fabric is also thick and heavy so it makes for a very structured-looking dress."
"2.0","I did not end up wearing this dress.","Both the 12 and 10 ran small on me even though I typically wear those sizes.","The dress was also too long for my body and the waist was too small."
"2.0","The elastic part around the high waist was just baggy.","It was very large!","I actual returned without wearing it."
"2.0","Runs small, ordered both 4 & 6 as usually Im in between sizes, however if I did in fact where the dress, the 6 would have worked, but definitely wasnt as loose as shown in the pictures.","Both dresses I got seemed worn and mis-shaped on the sides (one more than the other) - not sure if that is truly the style, or just have been worn too many times."
"2.0","Bust is excessively small."
"2.0","This shirt was REALLY short.","I couldnt even wear it with a high waisted pant because Im really not comfortable showing my mid-riff.","Just not my style."
"2.0","This dress was way too low cut."
"2.0","I ordered a 6 and 8 as a back-up.","None fit great.","6 didnt even come close to closing and the 8 was extremely tight.","The fabric is hard to move in.","My bust is pretty big so I think this is meant for petite women.","I didnt wear either dresses I ordered a replacement.","However, RTR is awesome with replacements.","There was a new dress at my door by the next morning."
"2.0","I ordered this dress for an event at work.","I was afraid it might be a little too flashy based on the photos, but in person it was actually very matronly!","The body was shapeless - no darts or seaming of any kind.","It was really unflattering - it made me look much older and larger than I am.","I was thankful that I had ordered more than one dress, as I just didnt feel good in this one and didnt wear it."
"2.0","Not very flattering..."
"2.0","Why is every dress on Rent the Runway 58 from shoulder to hem?","That cannot be true for all dresses.","The recommendations for height and heels are not working at all.","This dress was still way too long."
"2.0","I would suggest getting two sizes bigger than you normally wear.","The dress is very tight."
"2.0","This top is SO CUTE on the website, but so awkward and ill-fitting in actuality.","I wore an XS and the neckline was gaping.","It showed almost my entire bra and gaped so much in the front that I could look down and see my belly button.","The neckline in the back is also extremely loose so that it kept falling off my shoulders.","So sad because the idea of the shirt -- with the wrap and big bow -- is adorable."
"2.0","I typically LOVE shoshanna dresses, they always fit me in the right way.","Sadly this dress was a little too dated for the bridal shower i was attending.","I felt it aged me by 3-4 years."
"2.0","couldnt make it work dressed up or down.","too bad, it was cute -- just way too small for me."
"2.0","Im 50 and on the petite side.","This dress made me look bulky so it wasnt very flattering.","I had to return it."
"2.0","I was SO excited to get this dress to wear to dinner on the Bay when a friend was in town.","Based on other reviews, I ordered a XL (Im normally a 12), which was HUGE!","It also had no shape to it, whatsoever, so even trying to tie the ribbon belt was of no help.","If you are interested in something that is really flowy, maybe it will work for you, but I like to have a little structure to my outfits so this was a total miss.","I would also definitely order at least one size down, I think I could have worn a medium in this."
"2.0","Was not the right size for myself.","I am normally a size 6 and I needed a 4.","I didnt like how the cut was in front of the dress, so I didnt wear it."
"2.0","I was unable to wear this dress to my nieces baptism because it was beyond SHORT!"
"2.0","Runs small and heavy"
"2.0","The dress in a medium was far too large for me, plus it lacks any kind of pizazz in my opinion so I did not wear it"
"2.0","the dress was way too short to wear and sheer.","I didnt end up wearing it"
"2.0","Its a pretty thick material.","It almost seems like a formal dress that someone cut to a tank top.","Its definitely uber sexy if you are well endowed."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress, but wanted to write a review to point out that the dress is really heavy.","And it feels heavy when its on.","I have wide hips and a narrow waist, and it made both look bigger."
"2.0","I am 5 2 and tried the dress on 4 inch heels and it was still too long.","I know the description says the 0R can fit a 52 person but it is a bit deceiving.","I would say that if you arent minimum 55 dont get the dress.","Its a shame because it was such a gorgeous dress."
"2.0","Way to big not my choice"
"2.0","There was no possible way for me to even try to keep the sleeves up.","Literally fell around my waist because the shoulders were so wide."
"2.0","I wasnt satisfied with this dress for a company Christmas party.","On the model, the length looks appropriate as well as the cut, but neither were true.","I hate to say it, but this dress is definitely geared toward more petite women than myself (Im a size 10-12)."
"2.0","Too baggy to wear for work."
"2.0","Did not wear this gown, it was sent as a replacement for a gown I ordered and was unable to wear due to zipper damage.","I requested the 4R, received the 4P and could not even consider wearing it..it was WAY too long.","Stunning color."
"2.0","I was looking for a simple black dress.","this one wasnt the one"
"2.0","ran small"
"2.0","Once I did try it on before sending it back, it was a really sexy dress and my husband really liked it.","Unfortunately, it did not arrive in time for our v-day date."
"2.0","Thought it would be more lace-like.","It was more like zig-zags.","Thankfully this was my back-up dress.","The dress I ended up wearing was amazing and I received compliments all night."
"2.0","I thought the pictures looked great online but this dress was not for me... and I never had a chance to wear it.","The top fit too tight and although I could zip it up it was very uncomfortable and there was no give.","The dress must have just been dry cleaned however it was pressed horizontally in a way that made it unflattering and puffy which made me look 10 pounds heavier.","Had I worn it I would not have felt comfortable all night and I dont believe going a size up would have helped, it probably would make me look bigger."
"2.0","its heavy there are 4 layers underneath for poofy material."
"2.0","Have proper undergarments for this."
"2.0","Very tight and short"
"2.0","I normally wear a size 4 or 6 and this dress was very small in the chest.","It was hard to zipper up and I wasnt impressed."
"2.0","I sent this back right away.","It didnt fit  well anywhere.","It was tight across the tummy and bust, but as you can see in the picture, very loose in the arm.","I was wearing a dark blue bra in this picture.","It also had a tail on the zipper to help zip it up but it wouldnt pull when I did that."
"2.0","Unfortunately this outfit was not worth the wait.","Both pieces ran very large and wouldnt be comfortable for working out or wearing out.","The pants are a rough material for activewear.","The top offered no support.","Overall a disappointing rental that I didnt wear."
"2.0","This was one of my unlimited selections.","I really wanted to like it, but it wasnt long enough in the torso for me."
"2.0","Unable to wear the dress.","Too tight across the bust area."
"2.0","Dress was lower cut than I expected.","Fit was unflattering and uncomfortable.","Didnt even wear it!"
"2.0","The dress runs small and short.","I am 58 and it was too tiny.","It is small in the arms and was short as well.","I was looking forward to this dress but was quickly disappointed.","Get an xl if you are a size 10."
"2.0","I was really excited to wear this dress -- but tall women beware!","I thought that this dress in L length would be just about floor length --it actually stopped about 1 inch above my ankle!","Completely unwearable - luckily I had a fabulous Carmen Marc Valvo Pom Pom Peplum Sheath dress as a second style to wear to my Gala event!","Im sure tiny and shorter ladies will be fabulous.","Another thing that I dont you can tell from the picture is that there is a seam that goes diagonally across your chest, which I think is a little odd."
"2.0","Dress was too small, couldnt get my breasts to fit in it, though it was quite long- so going to a larger size would not have worked."
"2.0","I am 54 and this dress was too short for me without heels, standing barefoot so i could not wear it.","I would recommend renting the long!!","!"
"2.0","I was really excited to wear this out in Vegas but the top did not fit correctly at all.","There was a gaping hole where the cut out was supposed to be which revealed a little too much side and under boob for my comfort.","I ended up wearing a backup dress I packed instead of this piece.","This may look better on someone with a smaller chest but I would not recommend it if you wear larger than a C cup."
"2.0","A bit loose"
"2.0","I thought this was going to be the dress I would wear, but I HATED it.","I cant quite describe the extra fabric that was draped around my hips and bum, but it just hung there and looked ridiculous and added nothing but bulk.","I also did not like the feel of the fabric of the dress.","It looked horrible on my hourglass/pear shape."
"2.0","Im 57 and usually wear a size 14.","This came to just below my crotch and could not be zipped up.","Very disappointing."
"2.0","I like short, but this was very short.","Strange fit and look, made for people with really broad shoulders and short torso"
"2.0","This jumpsuit looks so cute online but when I got it I realized it was not.","It has a long crotch and then is short.","Not for me.","Plus the top was a lot lower than shown."
"2.0","While the 2 fit, I ended up not wearing the dress at all.","It was way too short."
"2.0","Unwearable."
"2.0","The dress was way small.","I wear a lot of Theory clothes, all size 2 but this one simply did not fit!","Everything was tight for me.","The dress is very structured and you have to be really skinny to wear.","Not recommended for curvy women."
"2.0","The fit is strange.","I tried a 36 and on my petite frame (104 lbs, 5 ft 2) and it made me look pregnant.","It also was SUPER short which was okay on me I guess, but Im not sure how a taller person could wear this!!","Overall, the dress is not flattering and I didnt wear it."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing it because it looked terrible.","If you have any sort of hips at all, just be aware that it is going to extend about 2 inches on each side because of the pockets.","It made me look huge."
"2.0","I was not pleased with this dress.","Some parts of the dress are stretchy, but others (like the arms) have no stretch in them at all, making it difficult to even bend your arm (and I do not have thick arms).","Also, it says on the main page for this dress to size down and I would highly recommend to size up.","I believe it runs small and again...not much stretching.","Overall, I wasnt impressed and ended up getting a completely different dress sent as a replacement that worked much better."
"2.0","I got a size 6 & 8.","Normally, I can comfortably wear a size 6 from pretty much any store.","But the size 8 was still too small, and did not flatter my body."
"2.0","The lining under the dress made it feel at least one size, if not two, smaller than the dress.","The dress itself was beautiful and had a nice stretch, but I couldnt even get it on because of the lining!"
"2.0","I didnt realize theres not much to this dress.","More for like a beach cover up."
"2.0","I am a huge fan of RTR (have worn 3 dresses prior) but I was very disappointed with this dress.","I usually wear a 16 and to be safe went with 18 and the general body part just right and comfortable.","The problem was the chest coverage.","The sweetheart was so low that it fell below the nipple area and my whole chest was visible through the lace.","Even a nude-colored adhesive bra would not make it look suitable at a semi-formal, family-friendly affair, as it was obviously, painfully, too low, and I couldnt find any adhesive bras at the last minute in a dark color (which might have been the only workable solution).","I have a good sized chest so its not that it would hang low on me in particular.","I tried to find a dark (navy or black) bra that could go with the dress but it was just impossible with the keyhole back.","In addition, the lace in the front around the neckline/collar didnt sit right, but that was minor in comparison to the chest issue.","Since I had not tried on the exact dress in advance, I thankfully had brought a backup dress with me."
"2.0","Pros- great material, nice color, made wellCons-skirt area is way too long & gathers are huge For my body type it aged me and was not flattering at all."
"2.0","I couldnt wear this dress.","The top was way too big!","Im a 36C and it made me look so flat.The top runs really large, but the bottom was true to size."
"2.0","Man, I really wanted to love this dress!","The color was lovely, but thats where it stops.","The ruching was off on the sides of this dress so that it pulled up one side higher than the other.","It pulled so tight that even the chest was off kilter .","It also made me look very overweight which was surprising.","I am a super athletic, 57 135lbs.","Not overweight in my book, but even my husband said it made me look frumpy.","But, he also admitted it could have been just the way the ruching on this one was so uneven.","It looks so great on other people, Im sure its just this one."
"2.0","Super short.","Not even close to a normal fit"
"2.0","I ended up not wearing this dress.","I am normally a size 14, but this 14 was HUGE on me.","It was larger than even a 16 probably would be.","It was disappointing, because it was a beautiful dress.","Also, it looks like its brown, but its actually black eyelit, with a light (beige) lining, that shows through."
"2.0","Read the reviews!!","Size down and you might be able to wear this dress"
"2.0","So the dress was a bit of a nightmare.","Im 53 and the shoulders needed someone a few inches taller because they were falling and screwing up the cut in the back of the dress.","But even worse was the front was too low and more importantly too open (wide).","There was no way to go to an event or even walk outside because it put absolutely everything (including half my bra cups) on display, and Im a DD.","the size 12 was too small for the side zipper and the 14 was just made for a taller bustier girl.","I ended up having to safety pin the whole damn thing and it killed it."
"2.0","Yuck!","This dress totally hid my chest, making me look even flatter than I am.","The abdomen region was stretched out or just too much fabric - looked like i was trying to hide a baby bump with nothing to fill it!","It was a bit tight through my thighs, but that happens sometimes.","The long was at least 1 inch too short with no shoes on."
"2.0","Unfortunately, this dress arrived and didnt fit.","My 38C/D chest size (43 bust) would not remotely zip into this dress.","There material has no give, so there was no making it work.","Also, the dress is cut with an incredibly short torso.","So even if the girls would have fit in, the waist would have sat 1-2 above my natural waist, and wasnt flattering at all.","(Im only 56 and not exactly long in the torso)"
"2.0","Fit well, definitely high quality."
"2.0","I returned this without wearing it.","I hated the fabric as soon as I took it out of the package."
"2.0","This dress is not made women with a full bust"
"2.0","I rented this dress for my brother-in-laws wedding but both sizes I rented were SO short that you could see my underwear!","RTR was GREAT though and overnighted me another stunning dress.","Watch out if you have long legs!"
"2.0","i shouldve listened to the other reviews.","i am a 34C and couldnt get the vest portion to zip.","i suppose if i got a M or an L that may have worked, but as it stands, there was no way i was fitting into that vest portion.","the skirt portion was also very thin.","so you have a rather thick top w an almost see through bottom.","wouldnt recommend this until youre v narrow and perhaps it is summertime?"
"2.0","too loose thru the midsection and arms and was a really awkward fit for me so I didnt end up wearing it."
"2.0","Truth is, I fell in love with this dress because of the sequins.","And what better way to celebrate Christmas than this show-stopper.","The only problem is that I love to dance and this dress just isnt made for it.","The back, which is part of the wow-factor, is too wide and unless you have several feet of double-sided table, it simply wont stay put.","The sequins do graze against the under arm skin and if you are sensitive, forget about it.","I ended up changing dresses half way through the party to a Nicole Miller number.","Id order it again if I knew for certain that I wouldnt be moving around too much.","I wish it had worked out better."
"2.0","I am petite but with a large chest.","This barely covered my chest.","I chose not to wear it"
"2.0","The fit was very small based on typical sizes.","Also, it fit very tight in the thighs for me."
"2.0","The fabric was pretty thick and the dress just didnt hug my curves right.","Was pretty disappointed and ended up wearing another dress."
"2.0","I ordered this dress for a black tie event.","I normally wear a size 6 but I ordered the 4R and 6R.","The 6R was way too big.","The 4R fit my body but it was too SHORT!","Even with flats the dress length looked awkward for a black tie event.","Needless to say I had to rush to the mall last minute to buy a different dress for the event.","Major bummer:("
"2.0","At not quite 58 I couldve tried to find kitten heels for this 12Ldress.","But unfortunately while it fit, it was ratty and my husband even said goth.","It had worn out  lace at the neck and crushed tulle, which could be ironed but there was no scalloped pattern around the neck left on this well worn dress, sadly.","It was my first RR experience, dont know if I would rent a long dress gain with length issues and certainly not one with this many reviews, showing its age.","I did wear the back up however."
"2.0","I rented this for a gala I have coming up - I wanted to give myself enough time to get the right dress.","Thank goodness I did!","I tried this one and was horrified to see that it downplayed my chest and was like a gleaming neon sign to my stomach and hips.","If you have any anxieties about your hip area this is NOT the dress for you.","I am a usual size 4-6 L but this dress did NOT do me any favors (hence no photo!)"
"2.0","The dress runs true to size.","Since I am 52 and three quarters, the 6R was a tiny bit too long.","I could have worn 4 inch heels to make it work.","The fabric was pretty thick and not flattering on my figure.","The undergarment champagne, colored silk was not as visible as I would have liked.","The black overlay was thick, so it was much more heavy and dark than I expected."
"2.0","When I received this dress it reeked of a smell I could not pinpoint.","I had to spray Febreeze on it to get rid of the smell (it didnt get rid of the smell).","I didnt end up wearing this dress to my CEOs wedding (which I was planning + decorating) because the extra small size was still way too large for me.","This is a stretchable dress, and it seems like others who have borrowed it in extra small had large hips.","So my theory as to why the hip portion of the dress was way too big is because others have overstretched them.","My advice is that if youre anything like my size (a small, petite and skinny girl), please consider another dress!","Sorry I didnt take a photo for you all to see, unfortunately I didnt feel like taking a photo in the dress.","I really dont want to rent another dress from Rent The Runway again because of this experience.","But they only return credit so I have no other choice."
"2.0","This dress is huge.","I pretty must always wear a medium dress.","I put this one on and knew immediately it wouldnt work.","It is cut VERY large.","I would reccmmend sizing down."
"2.0","I rented this dress for my bridal shower, and as much as I wanted to love it, the fit was off.","I have a higher waistline, and the waist on this dress was down to my hips.","It was also very tight around my chest.","Unfortunately, I was unable to wear either size."

"2.0","This was HUGE!","I am a busty person (28E), but the XXS swallowed me whole and made me look pretty large."
"2.0","I am 52 and this dress was longer than I like.","The  sleeves are 3/4 length and I found them to be too big.","The dress looks great on the model but not the same in person.","I typically wear a 4 or 6 and the 4 fit best aside from the arms"
"2.0","Needed a simple dress for a concert so I rented this but it was way to small.","Ended up wearing something else but wasnt happy with the small fit."
"2.0","I was very disappointed in the quality and feel of this dress.","This is the first dress I have ever returned immediately without wearing from RTR.","The skirt portion of the dress is very clingy and feels cheap.","The top is not a pretty as the pictures make it look - the fabric is shimmery and stiff."
"2.0","I rented this dress for a friends wedding.","I ordered the 12 and a 10 as my backup.","I did not end up wearing it as Im very short-waisted and the waistline of this dress hit me in an odd position; above my natural waist but too low for an empire.","Its a beautiful color and finished perfectly but just didnt work on me."
"2.0","Drapes like a curtain.","I have curves but it wasnt flattering to my hips.","Go with seomthing else."

"2.0","Too big and cheaply made."
"2.0","These pants look amazing on the model.","However, I found them to be tight in the waist/thighs and too long to be flattering.","Theyd need a few inches hemmed off the bottom to give the cropped look shown in the photos.","Returned without wearing."
"2.0","I wasnt able to wear this because it barely covered my bottom.","I normally wear a 4, but ordered the 6 because its all they had available and I felt it was too small in my hip area.","I do have larger hips and a round bottom, so the back was much shorter than the front on me.","It may work better on someone with narrower hips than mine.","The material and style of the dress is beautiful, just didnt work on my body."
"2.0","This dress was not good for me at all.","It made me look very matronly.","Definitely not the look I was going for"
"2.0","to short"
"2.0","I order my true size and one size larger and both did not fit"
"2.0","This dress is beautiful but the chest is just way too big, separated and low.","I noticed a lot of women look like they are taping it, pinning it, etc.","I actually tried to put the dress on backwards to make it a lowcut back instead, but the zipper showed.","I just cant recommend this dress because you will be pulling, tugging, pinning and taping beyond comfort."
"2.0","I rented this dress for my friends birthday brunch cruise.","However, i did not wear it because it was extremely low cut- inappropriate low cut!","Im a 36DD and rented a size 8.","The waist fit fine but the cut was way too low.","Money down the drain."
"2.0","I ended up returning this - I tried the 4 on in the store in black .",".",".the 4 in red was TOO small and the 6 fell down!"
"2.0","Really short"
"2.0","I am 57, and this dress was very long and conservative looking.","Would look great for a graduation or bridal shower brunch, but not for a day party or anything more fun.","The fit was very large -- I could have gotten a 0, even though I usually wear a size 4.","I also did not like the fabric -- I ended up returning the dress."
"2.0","This is a beautiful dress.","The color is absolutely gorgeous, probably close to what the photo looks like.","Its a blood orange kind of red.","Anyway, it was so so so unfortunate that it was just too big on me.","Im a very petite lady so I usually cant find many strapless dresses that dont fall off, but this was such a pretty dress I had to give it a shot.","The dress itself is a bit heavy, which adds to the falling off part, but I guess thats expected with a long dress like this.","Also, Im 52 and this was definitely long even with 4 inch heels."
"2.0","While cute in the picture, this dress is incredibly short (to the point I wouldnt have been able to sit).","The material is quite heavy as well.","The next size up wasnt available, so maybe that would have fit better, but I didnt end up wearing this given the length."
"2.0","I ended up not wearing it because it was too tight in the shoulders.","I can usually wear a 4-6 jacket and thought I could do it with it opened but it wasnt comfortable.","It was a nice print and a heavy fabric to lay nicely"
"2.0","Beautiful material and looked nice on others, but the truth is, I *really* hated wearing this dress.","Heres why: - NO stretch: This dress looks like  it would have a little stretch to it.","It doesnt!","So if its the least bit tight anywhere, forget your ability to breathe.","- TINY arms: I dont have anorexic arms, but I dont have big ones either, and oh my gosh, the arm holes are tiny in this dress.","I literally couldnt get them into the size 2 version and this not only made me feel bad, but was frustrating.","They barely fit into the size 4, and I had to make my boyfriend drive since I had such limited range of motion.","- Big waist: Because of the arms issue, I had to size up just to fit my arms into the dress.","That meant I lost my waist because its not sized for my kind of hourglass figure.","Not flattering and I didnt have a belt that would work with the dress and solved the problem.","Summary: Beautiful color, nice pattern.","Would be good for someone not quite straight-bodied, but not quite hourglass and someone who has VERY thin arms.","Again VERY thin...","I thought I did, but no."
"2.0","It was extremely awkward fitting, not just around the bust area but around... everywhere else."
"2.0","The fabric is disappointingly cheap looking.","This is definitely not a lush item."
"2.0","It looked so cute on the picture- I was imagining a jersey-like material but it was instead very structured wool.","Really heavy and boxy.","I looked like a pioneer woman.","If you decide to try it out, definitely size down."
"2.0","Im usually a 4 - 6 but I figured since it looked like it was a loose cut I would stick with a 4 & 1 extra in size 2.","Well, I couldnt zipper the 4 up & my girls were abnormally smooshed!"
"2.0","This dress fit tight and wasnt flattering.","A waste of a rental."
"2.0","Would not recommend this dress- it was uncomfortable and I felt like I was constantly adjusting the top, it was difficult to find a strapless bra that would not show.","Having said that, I did receive multiple compliments on it and it looks good in photos.","Would not rent again."
"2.0","I normally wear a size 18 in formal gowns but this dress ran a bit large.","The material is very heavy and not comfortable.","Had to send it back, did not get to wear it  for the wedding I was going to."
"2.0","I rented this to wear to a family event and ended up not wearing it.","The dress is beautiful and fits well-but its SO HOT.","The fabric doesnt breathe at all, and I was feeling so hot and stuffy before I even left my house in it!"
"2.0","Unflattering for petite women"
"2.0","Runs small and was not flattering on me.","This would look best on someone whos petite"
"2.0","I typically wear a 0 and the fit of this one was very short in the front and fitted.","The side back details fanned out quite a bit and could be seen from the front which was not evident to me from the picture online.","I did not wear this as planned and sent it back."
"2.0","I was unable to wear this as it was WAY too tight."
"2.0","Short and tight - esp across the shoulders!","It would have been quite uncomfortable to wear.","Would likely fit someone more petite.","The material is beautiful, but not a great length for taller women."
"2.0","Great in concept.","Bad on.","This dress is heavy.","So heavy, the skirt pulls down to unflattering levels.","Its great right and you feel so hot and on trend before you leave the house.","But, halfway into the night I had major muffin top, only because the weight pulled this down to where my waist gets larger — it made me look bigger than I am and it was very unflattering.","I hope it was just a bad photo that I have, and that I didnt look like this all night."
"2.0","This dress is hilariously short.","waist/shoulder/hip measurements are true to size, but youd have to be no more than 5 tall to pull it off.","waste and bosom are 10 inches too high."
"2.0","This dress was in terrible condition and I did not wear it.","It was washed so many times it felt like rough paper.","The color is no longer the original one and is faded beyond belief.","There was fraying along the rope piece and the rope piece was wrinkled, scrunched, and un-ironable.","I am surprised the dress was even sent to me, as my order was originally delayed bc it was returned by a prior user in damaged or poor condition...very disappointed bc it looked like at one time it could have been a nice dress."
"2.0","The design was very pretty, as was color but the fit was very tiny."
"2.0","It runs very small, with little give in the fabric.","Size up!"
"2.0","This dress would not even wrap around- it was way too small.","I normally wear a size 4, but I feel like I should have rented a size 8.","Could not even wear it."
"2.0","Did not wear it as the zipper was not working correctly"
"2.0","If you have large hips, do not bother getting this dress.","very beautiful dress and i wish it fit."
"2.0","The flare at the bottom of this jacket is more exaggerated than in the picture.","Im pretty tall and it was still unflattering."
"2.0","Very pretty, long and flowy.","Definitely had to have worn super high heels."
"2.0","I wanted to love this dress.","The fabric and colors were great for every day at my rather conservative office.","Still, at 51, this dress was very (very) short, and a bit too snug in the midsection for a classic shift.","In the end, I returned without wearing outside."
"2.0","Very tight in butt area."
"2.0","not only was the color totally different but the lace looked delicate in the photo and is in fact itchy and heavy.","the dress is very heavy and looks matronly.","i also thought the see-through top would be nice but you couldnt even see-through it because the mesh was too thick.","definite dissapppintment."
"2.0","Much too short for anyone over 59.","I, 510...so 61 when I wear heels.","I got this to wear to my sons baptism and there was no way it would be appropriate that short.","Plus the arm length was really short as well."
"2.0","I have had great luck on renting dresses from RTR before, but this was my first bad experience.","The dress was tight on the best (I am average chested) and way to loose in the waste/hips/butt.","It was so bad, i didnt end up wearing it.","At 58 and with 3 inch heels the long was too short.","I thought the dress was ill-fitting and I would not recommend it for rental.","Shame, because I have had such great experiences with RTR before."
"2.0","The dress is beautiful, like a work of art.","No good for a petite person because the print and accents are very overpowering.","Didnt end up wearing the dress but think it would look better on a taller person."
"2.0","sadly, this beautiful dress had multiple issues.","both sizes I received (4 and a 6) wouldnt zip up easily due to it continuously getting snagged on the material AND both dresses the lining was showing below the bottom hem of the dress.","which made it look poorly made.","I was pretty bummed since the back of the dress is what made me want to wear it so bad.","thankfully, the other dress I picked from RTR fit and looked perfect."
"2.0","Even though I had an XS the romper was really loose around the arms and stomach, but ran true to size around the legs.","I ended up returning it without wearing it."
"2.0","There werent any reviews for this when I rented it so I definitely took a chance - and it failed spectacularly.","I rented this for a wedding and did not end up wearing it because it was so terrible.","To start, the dress is made of this really cheap, thin, itchy gold material - not like any of the other high quality dresses Ive rented from RTR.","The fit was also really weird.","The stitching where the ruffle part of the dress starts hits right at the hips, so the dress ends up riding up when you walk!","If you have any curves whatsoever, this dress will not work for you.","Im 52, 140 lbs and rented the 6 and the 8.","The 6 was way too tight around the hips (the material doesnt stretch) and the 8 was too long and fit too big up top.","The dress is pretty short so I would not recommend this dress if youre pear shaped unless you want to end up flashing people!"
"2.0","Not a fan of this dress.","I was very disappointed."
"2.0","The color has a lot of orange.","The romper was too short, even as a large.","Im 57 and there was no way to wear this."
"2.0","Im  returning this without wearing it.","Im a size 10/12 in clothes but ordered the 14 because I figured the dress would run small.","Small is an understatement.","There is no way this is a 14.","Maybe a small 12.","It was snug all over & the bust wouldnt even close.","It looked a little worn & there was some kind of whitish stain on the front of the dress.","Disappointing for my very first Unlimited Rental."
"2.0","I received this dress in a size 6 and 8 and I couldnt wear the 6.","I fit it the 8 but the top was baggy and it was tight on my hips.","You need to be tall and skinny to wear this one!"
"2.0","If I was a 6 foot model it may have been nice.","Not for petite gals"
"2.0","I rented this for my bridal shower, but I was unable to wear the dress because it was too small.","This dress runs very small & unfortunatly I took the chance on the dress because they did not have the next size up available for me to get as a second rental.","Also there was a small hole in the dress.","Disappointed with this rental :("
"2.0","The romper was very boxy, which just made me look rather large.","Probably would be good if you can fit in XS but for someone with a chest it just did not work well.","I was planning to wear this for my bachelorette but did not"
"2.0","This dress was very sophisticated, shoulder area was very large with prominent pads.","Runs pretty long, but I am only 52.","It is heavy fabric.","I was my backup dress and I would have worn it but the entire zipper was missing.","I was a bit disappointed in the quality control of RTR because of this.","But, customer service overnighted me 2 other dresses so the day was saved!"
"2.0","It was just too voluminous.","I felt like a polar bear."
"2.0","I rented this dress and did not end up wearing it.","I tried on both the 10 and the 12.","Both were too big from the waist up and snug from the waist down.","The dress material itself is super stretchy but the lining is much narrower than the actual dress.","I think the dress would have actually fit better with no liner!","The sleeves were also loose and it looked funny on the lace side."
"2.0","The dress was very loose fitting, it was quite unflattering.","I typically wear 00 or 0.","It was also a bit long (half way between my ankles and knees) although I am only 50.","Im not sure if this is typical for Tory Burch or if I was just unlucky."
"2.0","I did not wear this dress -- the fit was disappointing.","The waist of the dress hit me about 3-4 inches below my bust, and unless I were to stand completely stiff and straight the entire night, made it look like there was a pudgy roll right under my bust whenever I moved.","I think it was due to the sequined lace-over-nude material and I dont believe going up a size would have helped.","That would have just made the dress loose all-around.","I was very disappointed!","It looked great in the photos..."
"2.0","Small"
"2.0","I went out on a limb and rented a dress without any photo reviews yet, bad idea.","Like some other reviews say, this dress is made for straight and narrow bodies.","Looks very weird and even loose on the sides for curvy bodies."
"4.0","The dress is gorgeous, but unfortunately runs too long - I ended up wearing my backup dress.","I would say this dress is ideal for women who are 57 or taller."
"4.0","WAY TOO BIG IN THE TOP.","I wear a 32-34A and this dress was not good for that.","The rest looked cute but it was way too big and non-adjustable."
"4.0","I really wanted to like this shirt but it is A LOT of look.","Runs big so size down.","The sleeves are super puffy and combined with all the wrapping fabric and the bow it was just too much of a statement look particularly for work.","Small chested ladies be cautious as I think this would take at least a C cup to have it lay the way it should."
"4.0","This ran bigger than I expected from other reviews.","I thought I would need the 12 to fit on top but definitely could have gone down a size.","The rest of the dress was big but really comfortable.","I got a lot of compliments on the dress itself but it definitely wasnt flattering.","I wore the 12 because the 10 wasnt available.","I would try this dress again in a smaller size."
"4.0","Such a cute dress on the model, but I was a little too short at 53 so the legs hit at a funny point.","Also small chested and the fit was a little baggy / pointy.","However, a smaller size wouldnt have fit, either...probably best for someone relatively tall with moderate bust size."
"4.0","couldnt wear it, too big."
"4.0","This is really a beautiful dress and the simplicity of the cute and the color are a wow combo.","The fit is better suited for those with less curves--it was a little too snug on the hips for my taste."
"4.0","Rented this dress but ended up not wearing it for the occasion because the dress runs too big.","I had to return it early the day of the occasion .","Am 174 ib  ht 5.6 .","Size8 was big on me  and  my usual dress size is 10US.","And that the size I wore for the alternate dress I  bought.","The quality of the dress was fantastic .","Will I ever rent again from you?","Yes.","But am scared ."
"4.0","Unforatunately I wasnt a huge fan of this dress to begin with but RTR sent me this at the last minute as a replacement for the NYE dress I chose.","I just didnt fall quite right on me and left me feeling very strange."
"4.0","I got this dress as a backup because my original dress did not come back in time.","I wish I would have just canceled my order.","This dress is very flowy and moved well but it made me look like I was expecting, which is not the look you want when going to a family event.","I ended up not wearing the dress and going with something from my own closet.","I would recommend this dress if you are looking for maternity wear or if you are a size 2."
"4.0","I was so excited when the dress arrived but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I realized Id have to scrap the plans of wearing it.","Based on the reviews that the fabric was stretchy I (mistakenly) thought this would be a great option for my hourglass shape.","Normally a size 8, I ordered both a 10 and a 12 since Im an hourglass shape and was worried about fit over my bust.","Both dresses were a good fit through my hips and waist but wouldnt zip fully to the top because it wasnt roomy enough in the bust.","I was unable to use the dress and had to run out last minute to purchase a dress at full cost.","Its a gorgeous dress but unfortunately runs small if you have a larger than average chest."
"4.0","It was longer than I thought it would be and was tight around the bust area.","It looked better in my head than it actually looked on me.","Plus, the dress i received had a hole in it, but RTR was great about me returning the dress!"
"4.0","The dress fit nicely but the fabric print looks cheap in person and resembles a 1950s picnic blanket.","Wont be renting this dress again but still love RTR!"
"4.0","A friend of mine rented this recently and I LOVED it on her.","Shes tall and lean, more of the body type on the model, so it fit as it should have.","Im much more petite and have a curvier build, and this dress was not right for me.","The XS zipped up tight on my ribs, but it was baggy around my waist.","So if you have a small waist / curvy build this dress is probably not for you.","However, if youre more of a model build then Ive seen it in person and it looks great!"
"4.0","I ordered this for a rehearsal dinner, along with another dress that I loved and ended up wearing.","I have a large bust and it was oddly tight and unflattering on my bust area.","The length and flow of the dress was fine, but it didnt fit me up top so I unfortunately couldnt wear it."
"4.0","Its a great jumper for anyone who is 54 and shorter.","It was too short on me to wear."
"4.0","Both sizes that I ordered were too small for my hourglass frame.","Pretty dress, but made very straight and without stretch."
"4.0","Let me start by saying that I am a true pear shape.","I ordered this dress thinking that it was more a-line, and it is not .It hugged in places I didnt really want to be hugged.","It wasnt terrible, but wasnt flattering.","Also, the colors were a bit drab.","I was expecting the blue to pop more against the black and it was more navy.","Overall, very underwhelmed."
"4.0","This dress is beautiful, but it literally sagged on me.","Order this dress two sizes down."
"4.0","This dress looks awesome on the model, but doesnt have a very defined waist in reality.","It bagged where it shouldve clung and clung where there should have been space."
"4.0","I can usually wear a 0 or 2 but for this dress both made me uncomfortable.","I have large hips and a larger butt for my size and it was definitely showing in this dress, that coupled with the short length made me feel less confident in the dress so i returned it.","If hip hugging is what you are going for, this is the dress for you!","If you prefer a more conservative cut, Id skip it."
"4.0","This dress is beautiful - and I would have loved to wear it, but even after ordering a size up, I still wasnt able to zip the dress up past the cinched waist band.","The 8L fit everywhere except around the waist, and though the second dress (the 10R) was larger in the bust and skirt, I didnt feel like it gave me any more room in the waist.","I just had my second child, so I thought it may have something to do with it, but I had my sister (510, 155 lbs) try  on the dress, too, and she had the same problem.","I would recommend being mindful of your waist measurements before ordering the dress - its gorgeous, it just didnt work out for me this time."
"4.0","I realized this dress is not my particular style for my body frame.","It fits true to size."
"4.0","the dress was a little loosenormally waer a 6 and the 4 was still a little big"
"4.0","straps are oddly short."
"4.0","Even though its a beautiful dress, it wasnt right for me.","I have a straight boyish figure and I didnt fill it out really.","I think it would be better on someone with hips.","So it was a bit lank on me."
"4.0","I ordered this through the Unlimited service to supplement my work wardrobe.","In the end I did not wear this dress because the front was too short to wear to the office.","This dress was an odd fit for me due to the length, but may work well for someone a little shorter."
"4.0","I wound up not being able to wear this because it was so long.","The dress is really pretty but it was more than 7 inches too long.","With the highest shoes it still wouldnt have been wearable."
"4.0","RTR sent me this as an alternative when the dress I ordered turned out to be unavailable.","This dress is stretchy so you can safely size down.","I didnt end up wearing it because its a bit conservative for me.","(side note: I ended up wearing one of the other options RTR gave me and was am happy.)"
"4.0","Material is really thin"
"4.0","I was a bit surprised that so many other comments said too big.","The 12 was snug and my chest, 36DD was too snug and busty for this party.","Excited to rent another dress for another occasion, but this was not the dress for me."
"4.0","When I put this on, I pulled it up and you could see everything.","I even think that if I wore a size bigger it wouldnt of  fit.","Wound up not wearing it."
"4.0","This is a cute top but is very flowy and runs large, even the XS.","The sides are also open so if you wanted to wear this to work you would need to wear a tank top underneath.","The color and concept is great, just wish the fit was better."
"4.0","Super cute dress and the size small fit my boobs and midsection perfectly but the dress was WAY too long.","The bottom hit only an inch above my knees and made me look much shorter than I actually am.","I tried pinning it but the ruching on the side stuck out when I tried.","I was disappointing because I like the dress so much but RTR was so helpful and overnighted me another dress immediately.","I would suggest that shorter girls think twice before renting this dress"
"4.0","I unfortunately had to return this dress because size 0 was too small and size 2 was too large.","It didnt fit me right but I do have to say that its a very cute outfit and it will stand out in any parties."
"4.0","This is NOT a good dress for girls with a curvy figure.","It was pretty short also - I didnt end up wearing it to my event.","Even with boots and tights it looked obscene."
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress.","the length was odd on me.","i am usually a 6R but the 6R was loose in the bust area.","I also had the 4R a a back up size and it did fit better.","So if you are smaller chested, consider sizing down a size.","someone else at the gala i attended wore this.","i went with my back up this time."
"4.0","I rented this dress but was unfortunately unable to wear it because of the length.","I am a tall girl and normally a regular is the perfect length so I dont have to wear high heels.","This dress was not that case.","Anyone over 57 needs the long!","Other than that, the dress was a nice light material and big on the top like all the other reviews stated."
"4.0","I really liked the cream color and body fit of the sweater.","Unfortunately it runs large in the arms which makes it look awkward, especially because there are cut out shoulders.","Poor design.","Would likely not rent again."
"4.0","I rented this for work.","It was not flattering at all.","No matter how you tie it, the neckline folds over so you can see the inner seam.","It ties in a weird spot on your waist.","Overall, it looked messy on."
"4.0","I love the idea of this but it was just massive...I am not sure even a smaller size would have help."
"4.0","This dress runs extremely small!","The backup size wasnt available.","A friend on mine who is a 2 tried on the 6 I rented and it was barely large on her.","Beware."
"4.0","I was sent this dress as a replacement for my backup size.","It was terrible for my bottle.","I felt like it cut in the wrong places and felt too tight.","Maybe the M would have been better."
"4.0","This might be the first time that I have not loved something I rented here.","I red the reviews that said though the top was loose/lowcut/big, a bit of fashion tape would fit it.","When I put it on, there is no way that just a little tape was going to be sufficient to hold this in place so that my bra/chest would not be visible to the whole world.","But the small and the large had the same issue where the top was so big that my entire bra/chest was exposed.","I ended up wearing a tank top underneath and it was fine.","Also was a bit frustrated to see that the belt arrived separated from the piece as the belt would need to be threaded through a lined belt-line instead of just through belt loops.","It would have taken a while to get the belt properly though the piece, so I decided to wear it on the outside, which was a bit of a problem as it keep sliding around.","However, despite all the issues and once I got into it and everything settled, it is a comfortable piece to wear.","Shorts were short, but looked good with both flats and heels."
"4.0","I wanted to wear this, I really did.","I love the fabrics and the cut, the style, the bright white.","Its chic and fashionable, sexy yet sophisticated.","And maybe if it was winter and I could pull of tights, then I would be able to rate this romper (from one of my favorite brands!)","five stars.","But I just couldnt have my butt cheeks hanging out the bottom of this hot white number.","Bummer too, because I really love it!"
"4.0","I rented this dress through my unlimited subscription, hoping to wear it during my engagement photos this weekend.","I wanted to order a small, but I got a medium because it was all that was available and Im on the cusp between two sizes.","Im petite, and the medium is just too roomy.","The sleeves are too long, the coat is too long, and its roomy all over in an unflattering way.","Im returning and hoping to rent a small soon, for every day use.","The fabric also seemed a bit warn, but it seemed like it could be cozy in a casual setting.","Color was fun!"
"4.0","This was my first choice dress but I ended up wearing my back up (which was fabulous!).","Im typically a size 12, but even in the 10 the seams on the shoulders were too big and the dress just looked sloppy.","The sleeves were too big (wide) as well.","Also I didnt care for the finishing detail on the sleeves and hem."
"4.0","This dress was way too big!","Ive worn this designer about 3 times now and all the other dresses fit great."
"4.0","This dress was chosen for me by the stylists.","The size 4 of another dress I ordered came back too damaged to rent to me.","So, this was their substitution.","I really was torn and couldnt decide which to wear - if youre wondering, this is the other dress I ultimately wore instead: [https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/yoanabaraschi_dresses/oscarwilddinnerdress] The 4 fit well, but I do feel like it could have fit better around the hips - but since it was a fuller skirt, it ultimately didnt matter.","I actually, didnt choose to wear this dress because compared to the other one, the skirt was much fuller (Im short, and I feel like it accentuated my rear end a little too much), and the other dress had pockets, which was a great feature, this one did not.","I did like the neckline - is was low cut to accentuate, but not TOO low to cause a wardrobe malfunction.","That said, I really did like the pattern and the fabric too, and this would be great for a fall occasion."
"4.0","This dress was very large and looked very baggy.","I was unable to wear it, but RTR sent me a different dress that I wore since my backup size was unavailable."
"4.0","The knit top of the dress crosses at what should be just above the natural waist, but on a shorter frame in a size 8 it was to long in the body with the waist sitting to low and the arm holes low enough to show a bra."
"4.0","This dress was either mismarked or it runs way too short.","I almost 510 (got the 2 Long) and when I stood bare foot this dress didnt even touch the ground, making it look ridiculous in heels.","I ended up going with another dress last minute cause theres no way I could wear this."
"4.0","Unless you are below 100 lbs and under 5..do not order the XS"
"4.0","I was really excited about this dress, but I didnt end up wearing it because the drop waist looked so silly on my body.","I really liked the eccentric side panel patterns, and Id love to see this style in a different construction."
"4.0","Didnt wear.","Too baggy in the abdomen"
"4.0","The reviews for this dress didnt really explain that you REALLY need to go up a size in it due to the tight fit of the waist and hips and the non-stretch fabric.","It was too small for me but I really love this dress and may order it again in a larger size!"
"4.0","Pretty color for Fall and the length is great but the sleeves were too big so I did not wear it."
"4.0","The fit of the dress was not flattering.","Waist area way too baggy compared with the rest of dress and I do not have a small waist.","Dress arrived without the featured tassels so RTR customer service came through by sending me an extra dress to make up for it, since it was my first unlimited shipment."
"4.0","Wanted SSOOO badly to wear this dress, as its ALMOST perfect.","The idea of it is amazing, nut the chest runs HUGE for the size.","I wear a 32DDD bra and it was STILL gaping open on either side of my boobs...Was so bummed"
"4.0","Runs small on the back/waist which made my stomach and back look larger and lumpy.","However, the shoulders and the neckline felt tight.","Not the most flattering dress on me so I had to exchange it for a different dress.","I am crossing my fingers the other dress looks great on me if not I am out of luck!"
"4.0","This dress looked really lovely but did not feel so great on.","The fabric is thick and silky and the color is a navy blue.","It fit me very well length-wise but the bust was incredibly tight.","I didnt realize how tight it was until after I took the dress off and noticed the deep scratches all around my chest from the dress cutting into me all night.","Yikes.","Not pleasant.","I do not recommend this dress just because I have rented from RTR multiple times and have found other dresses to be a better fit and more beautiful.","As always, exceptional customer service prior to rental so that always keeps me coming back."
"4.0","This dress was a size 12L.","I normally wear a 10L but struggled to squeeze into the 12L.","There is a band/fabric on the waist that was difficult for 3 people to zip up.","Once it was zipped I felt like I couldnt breath, the entire night.","It was very pretty and I received many compliments for a St. Pattys Day wedding...but I was excited to unzip it!!",":-)"
"4.0","This dress is beautiful but even the petite size was a little to big for me.","Short ladies be careful!","I ended up wearing my back up dress."
"4.0","This dress has a VERY big slit on the side in the front -- if youre larger chested or arent totally confident about your legs, this isnt the best choice.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","Big across chest and abdomen."
"4.0","This dress is really pretty and it is just as pretty when you see it in person.","This was my backup dress for a formal event I was going to.","I am a size 4-6 and I got a 6.","When I got it on, I thought it was incredibly tight and did not flatter my figure.","I am thin but I still have boobs, a booty and I felt like the dress made me look pouchy and heavy.","I was glad that I had another dress to wear that night but was sad that I didnt get to wear this one because it really is pretty.","I think it is definitely great for slender girls with smaller breasts.","If you have a hourglass or pear body type or boobs, approach with caution.","It is not very forgiving...."
"4.0","I wasnt able to wear this dress :( The top area was HUGE!","Im a 3^B and it was gapping horribly.","The bottom fit perfectly, so I dont think a size 4 would have worked.","Too bad, it was a cute fall print!"
"4.0","Dress is beautiful.","It runs small in the bust.","The dress does pucker a bit at the waist making it appear as though you have a baby bump.","I would recommend for those in their early pregnancy.","Unfortunately I didnt wear the dress - for my event it was way too small."
"4.0","This jumpsuit is a flattering  material and the top is cute, but it was WAY too short!","Im 56 and the regular looked like cropped pants on me.","If the pant was tight or slim fit, it might work...but theyre flared so this was a really awkward fit!"
"4.0","Because of fit issues, I didnt end up wearing it.","The neck was extremely low but it would have held with tape.","My big issue was the zipper.","It wouldnt lay flat in the back and it caused the back hem of the dress to be much higher than the front.","It just didnt look right."
"4.0","If youre more than three months pregnant, dont bother with this supposedly bump friendly gown.","The empire waist is such that no one rocking a bump can wear this otherwise gorgeous gown.","It wouldnt zip up but around the top of my bump, and was baggy in the bust area (even though I have bust to fill it out!)"
"4.0","I recommend ordering at least 2-3 sizes up for better fit around the rib cage.","I loved the material and pattern, but only wish I would have ordered the right size."
"4.0","I am a size 8 true to size but this dress was super tight and thick on my chest.","Given I am a double D bra size so of course its going to be a little tight but this didnt really flatter my figure.","The size bigger was too big so I went with the smaller version.","The color was pretty!"
"4.0","I have a larger upper body and this dress did not fit.","Although, i must say the length would have worked great, which is unusual since i am short.","Also the color looked great with my skin tone.","I did not end up wearing this dress."
"4.0","I have a straight figure and this dress was very poofy at the waist - not flattering.","Maybe for a girl with curves it would be more flattering, although the top fitted well and I have a small chest.","Color and fabric were nice though."
"4.0","I loved this dress, and everyone at the wedding complimented me on it, however I almost was not able to wear it.","I am normally a 0-2, 0s being quite often too small, and the 0 was falling down on me.","Im also not flat chested being a 32 C, so it was quite odd.","I had to safety pin it under the ruffles and use double sided tape all the way around it.","Overall it made the dress really uncomfortable and made it hard to have fun because I was constantly pulling it up.","But it looked great In pictures.","I would have returned it for another one but they hardly had anything available at that point."
"4.0","The tie sits way lower on my hips than I thought it would!","I have a short torso, and I thought it would tie around my waist, but it actually falls at the hip.","Also has a big opening in the midsection that the tie covers.","Just not really flattering on me."
"4.0","I originally thought this was going to be like a sweater but it was actually very thin like a blouse.","I loved it but it was unfortunately too small in the chest and arms.","I got it on but it wasnt comfortable and could be worn because it ran small and didnt really fit over my chest."
"4.0","I was excited or this dress and do think it is super cute.","That being said, it just didnt work for me.","It could have been okay if I had gotten a smaller size but the denim on the top is super stiff and it just didnt hang well on me.","Again, it is a super cute dress but probably is more suited to someone taller and slimmer that me."
"4.0","I was excited about the dress, but the dress hit me at the most awkward mid-calf length and made me look very short and stout.","Wore this to work one day and could not wait to get home to take it off.","I could see it working out for a taller person.","but at 54, this was just really unflattering."
"4.0","This is a metallic dress.","For some reason, I didnt get that from the photos, but it is very shiny in person.","The fit was very large and long - felt like a lot of extra fabric - and it is stiffer than I thought, so it didnt fall well.","I think it is probably best suited for someone tall and thin; at 54, it just didnt suit me.","If the fit is right, it is very cool-looking for a party or trendy affair."
"4.0","I rented this dress for a casual pre-wedding party, but I didnt end up wearing it.","It is a thin wool-like material and it hugs the body.","I felt like it showed my belly pooch, and you definitely need seamless underwear.","I almost wore this with leggings underneath (as pictured), but as I was sitting around the house waiting to leave, I decided I was too uncomfortable to spend the whole night in this dress.","Another thing that was weird about the dress is the neck hole and arm holes are TINY.","I could barely get my head through the neck hole, and the arm holes irritated my skin-- and this was after going up a size.","Anyway, this dress was not for me!","Will think twice about renting Missoni again."
"4.0","I dont have the body type for this dress I guess.","It was tight in the boobs, loose in the middle and huge in the legs.","I really wanted it to look good - but it just didnt.","I sent it back & took the loss.","If you are tall and thin with a long torso, you will have better luck than me."
"4.0","I did try it on and this dress runs big."
"4.0","I typically wear a 10 in jeans, but Im small on top.","So in formal wear with a forgiving bottom, I tend to go for smaller sizes so the top will fit.","Hence, I ordered a 6 and 8 in this.","The 6 was still too big.","It was able to stay on, but my friends didnt think it was flattering, so I wore a dress I brought as back up.","The 4 would have been a better fit and I may have even been able to wear a 2.","Oh, and the zipper on the size 6 didnt work, either, so I wasnt able to wear either of the choices."
"4.0","Had to return.","The dress fit, overall, but the darts in the front were very poofy and awkward.","They bunched a lot when I moved or bent forward in any way."
"4.0","Dress doesnt give you any shape and is huge!","Im between a medium and large but probably could have worn an XS in this dress!"
"4.0","I am 53/54, 125lbs, and have a pear shaped body.","The dress was beautiful.","However, the length was too long for my height.","The fit states from shoulder to hem is 54 but im not sure if its describing the under skirt of the dress or the top skirt of the dress because it definitely did not fit as a midi dress as seen on the model who is 510.","I think the description is misleading stating the dress is recommended for 52-56.","I looked frumpy due to the length being too long.","I wouldnt have rented this dress if the description had been more accurate.","Good thing I rented another dress as a back up.","I ended up not wearing this dress, which was unfortunate since I really loved the design of the dress."
"4.0","My usual size (2) was unavailable so I rented a size larger (4).","It was a little big in the waist but almost too short."
"4.0","It kind of just hung on me without emphasizing my curves.","Its a really popular dress, and it seems to look great on a bunch of different gals and body types.","But, I wasnt one of them.","I ended up wearing my back-up dress."
"4.0","I did not like this at all.","The shorts were far too long on my petite frame of 52, the material wasnt flowy (its cotton) so it gives it a sort of stiff look.","I didnt even wear it, I sent it back with the tags still attached.","I imagine this would look great on a taller gal with a bust."
"4.0","I rented this dress in an 8 and a 10 US sizes.","Im typically a 6-8 size.","I couldnt breathe in the 10.","It was massively short and so tight fitting that I couldnt wait to take it off.","I wish this had fit its a lovely dress."
"4.0","I didnt love this dress and would definitely not rent it again.","The size 8 was frumpy on me, so I wore the size 6, which was SUPER short - like if I raised my arms it barely covered my butt short.","Im 52, so for something to be short on me is rare.","I actually wondered if maybe it had shrunk at some point.","Overall I just didnt find the dress to be flattering at all.","It made me feel like I had a tire around my mid section because of the way the lining laid under the lace.","A picture from the side looks like a big blob as it just kind of hangs straight down.","I didnt even receive one compliment on this dress like I usually do with my RTR dresses!","It wasnt terrible, but I definitely didnt feel good in this dress!"
"4.0","I loved the dress, tried it on the night prior to the event but was displeased with the delivery method.","There was a storm the day it was delivered and it came hours before expected so the box was soaked through and through.","I was the MOH and the bride and I wanted a distinctive dress, so we ordered this.","Fit great except for the top was slightly looser than expected.","The zipper got stuck the day of and wouldnt give so I had to wiggle out of the dress.","I was livid that I was unable to wear it the day of and had to settle for my original dress.","The dress was gorgeous, but I never actually got the chance to wear it."
"4.0","When I tried this dress on, it showed flaws that I swear dont exist.","I am very happy this was only my back up dress!","Luckily a friend of mine came to the party too and with her fitness trainer body she looked like a million bucks in the dress.","If you have any flaws, or think you might have flaws..Id say this dress is not for you.","But thats my opinion."
"4.0","This dress runs quite small, and I unfortunately did not have the option of going a size up because only one was available.","The cut is deceptive - if you have big hips like I do, this is not the dress for you.","Would be a wonderful dress for a different body type, however - its absolutely adorable and the color is gorgeous!"
"4.0","The neck on this dress is high cut and tight.","I am a size 4 and this 4 was fine for work, but I found myself pulling down the hem a lot and tugging at the neck throughout the day, so would size up for comfort.","The dress is not lined (doesnt need it) and the fabric is very thin and stretchy.","I dont think Ill rent this dress again."
"4.0","I loved this dress.","I ordered an 8 & 10 based off reviews and I actually found it to run pretty small...the 10 was HUGE.","The 8 fit perfectly and looked great...but there was a stain right in the front where the lace overlays separate.","I couldnt wear it and sent it back.","Sadly, I didnt realize until the day of the wedding so I didnt have time to get a replacement from RTR.","Ended up wearing something I already owned...."
"4.0","Ran really big.","Very much a cream and less white.","Fit more like a trench to be worn over clothes rather than an independent trench dress."
"4.0","I normally wear a 4 or a 6 but after reading the reviews, I ordered this in a 2 and a 4.","The 4 fit fine.","Because of my chest, I couldnt get into the 2.","But really, I think that you have to be taller (Im 52) to pull this off.","The dress came past the top of my knee; I would have preferred that it be a few inches shorter.","As a result, it was fitted through my thighs and then baggy around my knees.","I tried hemming with fashion tape, but you could see the bulk of the material, and it looked worse.","Between the high neckline and the too-long skirt, I felt too covered up.","The material is so casual, too.","If the fabric were dressier, then maybe a more covered-up look would have been comfortable.","This was my first RTR disappointment."
"4.0","The sequins on this dress got caught on everything.","This caused a hole in each dress before I even got out of the house.","The back zipper had an uneven bumpy look in both sizes and neither one fit tight.","The sequins caused a rash on my right arm due to the positioning of the sleeve."
"4.0","For very tight, not very heavy chested friendly.","Used my backup dress."
"4.0","Big overall... shoulders, width and length seem 2 sizes bigger than the size on the label.","Wont be able to wear this one, unfortunately."
"4.0","Material gave my figure a strange silhouette with flat looking hips and rounded thighs.","I usually love these dresses but the material on this one didnt work for me."
"4.0","The dress fit true to size, wasnt tight in any areas, and the quality was mostly great.","The main issue I had with the dress is that the white part was pretty sheer, even my nude underwear showed through.","Maybe if I went a size up and it fit loose, that wouldnt be a problem, but I dont think this style of the dress is meant to fit loose."
"4.0","LOVE the flower detail.","Sleeves are way too long!"
"4.0","I wasnt able to wear this outfit that I rented for a birthday party.","It was really hard to get into.","The zipper would barely zip up even on the hanger and you could barely get into it because of the straps.","Never wouldve been able to go to the restroom while wearing this out so I sent it back!","Cute but too much work!"
"4.0","The color is fantastic.","I never got to wear because it is so tight - in the arms and waist."
"4.0","Cons: the fit was outrageously, tooo (and double times again) too long.","I didnt want to take a picture because it swallow me up.","(the material since it was too long)Even though it said, for height of 5.2 & up, it didnt do anything for me.","I couldnt work no way with it to wear it.","I was very disappointed because i couldnt wear it at all!","and i Wanted to!","When i tried it on and put a belt on, my husband was like, OK.. thats nice.","it will do.","but then he said turn around, upon turning, he change his song quickly.","no, you cannot wear that!","its too long!","it looks like a gown!!","Well, that end that.","Being short and of age* theres is just inches of a heel* that i cannot put my frame into.","Pros: The make, material, and pattern was just right for me!!","I wish you had it in a shorter length.","PLEASE, #RTR get some MAXI Dresses and Skirts for the below 5.2 gals!","we wanna enjoy them too!","That would be a nice addition to your clothes.","(as well as shoes) ijs.","Well, over all it was a great dress, and wont take away from my rental, just sorry I couldnt enjoy it as well as your model did!!","(~_~)Until my Next review.","Be Blesssj"
"4.0","Didnt end up using this dress runs large"
"4.0","I rented this for my engagement party but ended up returning it.","It is a cute dress but just wasnt for me.","It was not flattering at all.","the skirt was poofy and did not lay right.. it would be a perfect dress for a church function (baptism ect)  .but I returned it and the next day got the perfect dress!!","made me love rent the runway even more!!","!"
"4.0","I ended up not even wearing this piece because it fit so much different on me than on the model.","I didnt realize that it was actually two pieces of fabric overlapping eachother, and therefore due to my bigger bust, the pieces didnt cover me entirely and instead split open in the front so unfortunately I would have to wear a tank top underneath this which took away from the design.","It also made me look very large, potentially pregnant.","Not a good fit for my body type."
"4.0","The dress is cute in theory, but in reality its a little boxy and the slip underneath was peeking out!","It was a disappointment overall."
"4.0","This was the dress I rented as a backup, and I loved the style!","I rented both the size 4 and the size 6, and found that the size 6 was slightly more comfortable, given that the fabric could be pretty stretchy and it was a bit loose all over.","The off-the-shoulder neckline was perfect, and the plunge was not too low.","It was very structured, and even though I walked around in the dress, it did not slip down my shoulders.","The extra fabric covered my tummy, and I didnt need to wear Spanx.","However, since I am much shorter than the model, the dress fell to just under my knee and looked better when I folded the hem under.","I ended up wearing my first rental, but if I wore this style, I wouldve gone with the size 4.","I would definitely suggest this for an engagement dinner or church event.","Its not something that I wouldve been able to dance in."
"4.0","This top was so hard to wear because it was totally see-through and the straps were too big."
"4.0","Really cute, well made and nice color.","Problem was the pockets.","I tried in 2 sizes, but the pockets made the skirt pucker in a weird way at the hips making me look wide.","So disappointed.","I didnt wear either size.","Thanks to RTR for not leaving me with out a dress!"
"4.0","I usually wear a 4-6 in shirts and the Small (size 1) was too tight in the arms, yet was hanging funny off my shoulders.","The material was itchy and would have driven me crazy if I had actually worn the shirt for more than 2 minutes.","My husband liked the pattern and suggested I rent it again in the bigger size (until I had him feel how scratchy it was!)"
"4.0","This blouse is SO itchy and uncomfortable.","The bow was weird and did not sit well."
"4.0","This jumpsuit ended up being the back-up style for me, as one of the sizes of my original style pick was not returned on time/was returned damage.","The jumpsuit was cute, but I was unable to zip it (I was not even close to zipping it).","I would say that for my body type/size (bigger bust/chest) with smaller waist that a 8R or possibly even 10R wouldve been the size to get for this.","Per the other reviews, the pants are definitely thicker so I would not recommend to wear for an event that happens in warmer weather."
"4.0","I rented this for a black tie charity event.","My body most closely fits a pear shape, smaller chest/bigger bottom.","This dress in a size 2R was snug around my bottom half and too large on my chest.","My bra size is 34B, so my chest did not fill the dress out.","I had to use double sided tape as a quick fix to hold the topic the dress together otherwise my bra and chest would have been completely exposed.","I wont rent this dress again."
"4.0","Did not look good on me at all!","Looks better In the photo."
"4.0","This dress was supposed to be for a Fall themed bridal shower.","When I took it out, it was the brightest orange I had ever seen.","I had to return it.","The fit was also weird.","The arms are tight, the dress is short, and the midsection is not forgiving."
"4.0","Really beautiful dress, but not for ladies with hips or a butt."
"4.0","Not flattering on hour glass.","Broad shoulder are made broader and accented by weird cut.","While it was flattering the mid section the laying of the fabric was to off for me to wear it."
"4.0","This jacket was just ok. What you cant see from the picture is that it is cut very high in the back which I didnt love and there are very pronounced shoulder pads as well.","Other than that it had a good fit and the material was stretchy and comfortable."
"4.0","The fit was great, but the gown was very heavy and scratchy due to sequins.","Outdoor wedding, so I went with another gown."
"4.0","The dress fit true to size, just barely covered my back-end.","Even with tights, it was way too short.","The dress is a jersey material, so it fits snug -- wearing it with leggings just didnt look right."
"4.0","At the time I booked this dress, there were no other reviews up but it looks like others have had a similar experience.","Its a gorgeous print but you are constantly at risk for exposure both top and bottom.","The wrap style can completely open up in the wind or with movement, but I think is manageable.","The front is also quite low but has an optional clasp to make it slightly less revealing.","The real deal breaker, however, is the low back.","I love backless dresses but because the straps are so long, they can slip off your shoulders with incredible ease.","I wore it around the hotel to try moving in it while getting ready and ultimately decided to go with my backup style."
"4.0","Didnt wear.","It looked matronly, and made me look heavier.","And I am TINY."
"4.0","I ordered an 8 but really needed a 6.","The back of the dress lifted off the small of my back whenever I moved or sat down.","Wasnt a huge issue.","The big issue was the zipper!","When I first put it on, the zipper got stuck pulling it up right at my waist, which is the smallest part of my body.","Literally had to call my fiancee into the bedroom and it took him about 4 minutes of up and down and up and down to get it to finally zip up.","Went about the evening and got tons of compliments.","Then when it was time to get off, the zipper got stuck AGAIN in the same spot going down and the little zipper handle came off!","I was stuck and had to wiggle my bra out from the open side, then SAT ON THE FLOOR while my fiancee pulled the dress over my head a quarter centimeter a time.","Funny, but not cute or sexy."
"4.0","I tried on the medium, my normal size being a small.","While it fit, it is a stretchy dress, and it is not the heavy sequined material that I was anticipating.","Not appropriate for a 42 year old to wear to a party where work associates are present.","Save this one for a night out with friends.","I could fit into the small, if you’re going for that look."
"4.0","The shirt runs small.","I got a large and the cut just seemed too weird."
"4.0","I ordered this dress in two sizes for my friends 21st birthday.","Overall, the dress was just alright.","I wasnt blown away or anything.","The fit of the dress is kind of weird.","It is tighter at the top and very loose around the stomach and then tight again around the hips.","I think the worst part about the dress was that I personally was in between sizes.","I would HIGHLY recommend getting two sizes no matter what on this dress.","Also, the sparkles on the dress were uncomfortable at times.","In my picture, the dress does look longer just because of the angle but I was happy with the length.","5/10 rating for me"
"4.0","Unfortunately, this one was too short and almost impossible to get the wrinkles out."
"4.0","Fabric is super stiff, doesnt move at all and folds and bunches in weird ways.","Unflattering.","Didnt end up wearing."
"4.0","too poofy under the waist not a good fit"
"4.0","The fit was too big and a lot of material in the crotch area.","Overall, it was not flattering and it looked to work to feel confident in wearing.","I chose to not wear this."
"4.0","Very cute dress, however its not white and its very very warn.","This dress definitely needs to be retired.","There was a button missing on the back to keep the top closed, and the lace was falling apart."
"4.0","I loved this dress in pictures, and I ordered it as my back up dress for a wedding.","I was unable to wear this dress unfortunately- the material and color were great, but the pockets caused the fabric to bunch/poof up and form a pouch like area in my mid section.","It looked awful so I wore the other dress that I had rented.","Wish it fit differently!"
"4.0","Although I loved the style, I found that the slits on both sides started WAY too high.","I could only wear with very high rise pants so that a bulge did not stick out on each side."
"4.0","This shirt looks really cute on the hanger, but really only would look right on an athletically build person with a shorter torso and less than a C cup.","The material is nice enough, but there are snaps everywhere to keep this thing together and without fashion tape, it still might require a cami underneath.","High waist pants or a skirt are a must as the side where it gathers is at a strange place.","I wore it with a black knit Vince skirt that I could adjust to work, but I didnt love it enough to even photograph it for my review.","Does look nice from the back.","I am sad to part with some things from RTR, but this is not one of them."
"4.0","This dress was way too short on me which made it really annoying to wear.","The lining kept bunching up and it was too short to dance in.","Beautiful dress though.","The open back looked nice but I think it would gape a bit in women without a c+ cup."
"4.0","Im a huge Rent the Runway fan.","This was an OK dress.","I did not end up wearing this dress because it was too small in the chest but it flaired out too much over my hips.","I could have worn it if it were just a little snug in the chest, but the way the dress fit around my hips made it look more voluminous so it was not flattering at all.","Disappointed in this dress :("
"4.0","Unfortunately the pants were extremely small; if you have curves you may find it difficult to wear (XS).","The sweatshirt was very comfy and relaxed; I like that piece a lot."
"4.0","The color and fabric on this dress are great.","Sadly, thats about it.","The lining sticks out from the bottom, and I found the waist to fit odd.","Im about 58, and this dress hovered around my ankles, and was scrunched up on my torso.","I just felt like I was the complete wrong shape for this dress."
"4.0","Not flattering on my frame."
"4.0","My size is fairly consistent at DVF.","This style was far too tight and short for work, for which I rented versus other M dresses I have owned from DVF."
"4.0","The material is very thick and stiff.","This is not a dancing dress and should not be worn for warm temperature weddings.","Anyone below 54 should not wear this dress.","It runs a little small but the length is overall  very long.","The ruffle around the bust went down to my waist and the length was well below my knees.","The weight of the fabric made me feel like I was in a casing."
"4.0","The sleeves ran long and were loose fitting on the shoulder, but the mid section was very tight with little give.","The size small fit my midsection better but fell off my shoulders, so I went with the xs even though it was a little snug."
"4.0","I wasnt able to wear this dress because the zipper would not stay up.","There is no hook and eye, so every time I moved my shoulders, the zipper would start to unzip.","Definitely a disappointment, because the green lace was gorgeous."
"4.0","this dress looks a bit cheap in person."
"4.0","The top of this dress is very boxy and the arm holes are huge so you can see straight through the dress to your boobs if you lift your arms.","I was not impressed.","Maybe it would work on someone with broad shoulders/ bigger breasts.","It made me look flat-chested and terrible."
"4.0","The dress wraps in a way that shows ones entire chest, rendering it unwearable for anyone with anything but a flat chest.","The print is pretty, though, so I was sad!"
"4.0","While I loved the fit (length, specifically) and coloring; the material is uncomfortable, quite rough.","In addition, it doesnt look very well proportioned - the top is very bulky."
"4.0","I am giving this dress a 2-star review based on the way it looked on me, but I am sure it would look amazing on others.","Despite being pretty much full-sequin with substantial weight, its very slinky and clings to the body.","However, it simultaneously created a bit of a faux-tummy with extra fabric, even in the correct size.","Definitely think it would look much better on someone with major curves to show off.","As another review mentions, it is not just silver, there are a lot of greens, purples, and black mixed in there.","I actually really liked the color."
"4.0","Another fail for curvy girls.","I felt this was very matronly and I looked like an embroidered pillow."
"4.0","This dress is really great looking in person - but runs VERY small!","I couldnt even zip it up!",":( It was great quality - and looked slimming from the rouching...just couldnt get it zipped up!"
"4.0","If you have even a little bit of tummy, dont get this dress.","The sequins make everything look bigger."
"4.0","I really loved this dress and thought it was perfect for a date night but when I got it it was reeaallllyyy short, like shows the buttom of your bum short.","Unfortunately had to bring it back"
"4.0","The fabric is on the thin side and very unforgiving.","Even with Spanx, it would have shown some lumps and bumps.","It doesnt hold you or smooth anything out in any way.","Pretty color.","I picked true to size as I dont think it really runs small but it was a bit tighter around the hips than I usually expect a size 8 equivalent to be on me.","Could be the Italian sizing, not sure."
"4.0","The dress runs small.","Order 1 size up."
"4.0","This dress is really weird in person.","I am tall and an hourglass shape, and this dress suits neither.","Also, the colors are actually more of an ugly green and off white rather than the picture here, which kind of looks blue and white.","I would imagine that this dress looks good on short very skinny people, but definitely not for shapely or women."
"4.0","The bust was huge, and I have fairly large breasts (36C or D).","The shoulder straps fell off, and the front gaped open.","The regular was a little short on me too (I am 59).","The colors and material were very pretty though."
"4.0","I didnt really like the color/pattern, reminded me of curtain material.","Cut is nice/flattering."
"4.0","It runs big."
"4.0","Too large and puffy."
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress.","I rented it for a more formal Vermont Fall wedding.","The color and quality are beautiful.","But it hit me in all the wrong places.","I am a 4L or 6L in most full length dresses.","While my frame is small, I have a lot of curves.","The 6L fit perfectly, but it was just a very unflattering cut on me.","Where the waist hit make me look like I had shelf hips.","The zipper would NOT go up over the waist seam despite there being plenty of room.","The main issue for me was the inability to wear a bra with the dress.","The neckline of the dress is VERY low, possibly because Im long torsoed.","But a normal bra was totally visible.","If you have nice perky boobs, or are small chested like the model then you could definitely pull this off.","But it just looked sloppy on me.","I was sad to have wasted my last Style Pack purchase on this one.","If I hadnt been getting on an airplane to fly across the country the day it arrived, I would have tried contacting RTR to have a new style sent.","Ive heard theyre great about that.","I just didnt have the time."
"4.0","The dress itself if made of great material; definitely more ivory/cream than white.","I ordered a 10 because my sizes range from 10-12, but they did not have the 12 available for a backup.","The dress itself it larger than I would have expected; it was not form fitting in the chest/waist area, which ended up making the pleated section puff out (making my hip looks WAY larger).","Definitely wasnt feeling this dress, though I wish I had gotten it in a smaller size"
"4.0","Beautiful dress, very nice quality material but it did not work for my hour glass shape.","Looked horrible on so did not wear it.","Puckered at the hips, loose in the mid section, and tight in the bust area."
"4.0","I am a fit size 4, my arms are toned but not large.","Despite this, there was no way I could fit them into the size 4 I rented.","I got the size 6 as a backup, which fit in the arms but was loose in the waist and elsewhere.","A belt might have helped but I didnt have one that matched.","A beautiful and classy dress, but only good for those with stick thin arms!"
"4.0","This dress was less than appropriate for my occasion.","I had ordered it for an october wedding as a back up for colder weather.","This dress was so warm it felt like i was wearing a comforter.","The pockets would not stay down so it looked like I had 2 balls coming out of my hips.","It was less than flattering for an aline.","As far as color this was also not what I was expecting.","They should have a close up of the fabric because it was red and glittery which would not have been appropriate for my semi formal wedding.","The sleeves are cute but over all was not the dress I pictured."
"4.0","Lovely style.","The small was too broad in the shoulders and interestingly too narrow at the waist.","This may be better suited for shorter waisted figures."
"4.0","Too short.","I couldnt bend over, raise my hands up or sit down without almost seeing my underwear.","I ended up returning it.","I loved the dress though.","Very pretty and comfortable.","It just needs to be slightly longer."
"4.0","Bodice ran too narrow, and not enough room in the hip"
"4.0","It was also very itchy"
"4.0","The top was quite tight with no stretch, the sequins were scratchy.","It was a back up and I didnt  end up wearing it."
"4.0","Although this dress was my first pick, I ended up wearing my backup dress.","Not that the dress itself isnt gorgeous, because it was.","But on my frame, even the XS was a tad too big.","And the way it draped on my hips was unflattering.","Also note that there are some rust-gold sequins among the navy blue.","I wasnt expecting that and had purchased silver-colored accessories.","It was still very pretty, but I wasnt expecting the color contrast."
"4.0","Dress ran too small in the hips and chest.","There is no give with the fabric."
"4.0","This was a little flashier than I anticipated - I ended up not wearing it to the wedding!"
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing it because it was way too long for me.","Pretty pattern, but it fit weirdly on me."
"4.0","Honestly, gorgeous color and the right length, but my body proportions just did not work at all with the dress....i looked matronly in it!"
"4.0","This dress is even more interesting in person.","The fabric is more navy than the picture shows, and the fabric is a thick twill, like a light denim.","It is really pretty, but it is TIGHT in the bust.","I am small chested, but I had a hard time getting this over my bust while putting it on.","Otherwise, the size was just right."
"4.0","I wore this dress for my Junior Homecoming.","I thought it was all silver but when it got here it had red and blue in it.","It was a very pretty dress.","Also it runs way large.","I ordered the SMALL and EXTRA SMALL.","Im glad I read all the reviews first because i almost ordered a meduim instead of the extra small.","Tee dress run extra large.","The extra small was almost too big for me."
"4.0","I usually wear a 2 or a 4.","I read the reviews on this dress and decided to rent the 2, but it was still way too big, especially on top, so I didnt end up wearing it.","This dress is lovely, and Im sure would look great on someone with a larger chest."
"4.0","I was super excited to wear this jumpsuit on my vacation in Las Vegas.","However, when I received it in the mail both sizes ran way too small.","Im 53, athletic build with a small bust (34A) and weigh 125 lbs...typically wearing a size 2R.","The back and chest area run extremely tight and I could barely get the zipper zipped up all the way.","It would have been next to impossible to go to the bathroom without a friend assisting.","The crotch was also very loose for someone my height, which makes me think a size 6R would have been way too big in that area.","The length of the jumpsuit was pretty good, and the cut of the neckline was very flattering.","I just wish I would have been able to wear it."
"4.0","I never ended up wearing the dress.","It was so tight that my fat squeezed out the sides and Im a 0!","It runs very small.","I wish I knew to get a size 2."
"4.0","If you have a larger bust, definitely size up.","This would have been very inappropriate for me to wear to work with the amount of cleavage it was showing."
"4.0","The dress ran super small, I am usually a size 0 or 2 in dresses and a small was really tiny on me.","I could zip it, but barely and the mid-piece was tight.","Additionally, the neckline was wide, so wearing a regular bra would be difficult but possible if you paid attention to your straps all night"
"4.0","I love the colors but the waist is dead center and not very flattering.","My guess is that larger chested women will find it flattering because the seam will pull up higher like an empire waist.","But for me, it just cut me in the wrong spot.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","This dress fits kind of funny, hard to wear a bra, and it is essentially knee length"
"4.0","This is the second very expensive Badgley Mischka dress Ive rented that had a problematic zipper.","In addition, like the other one, it was very tight across the chest, with armholes that dug into my skin.","Unfortunately my backup size was not available, so I ended up being unable to wear the gown.","Although their designs are beautiful, I will have to skip this brand in the future."
"4.0","The dress was BEAUTIFUL!","Unfortunately, I had a difficult time with the zipper and returned it.","The part of the dress where the fabric meets bodice wouldnt catch and I couldnt zip it up, even with help.","I tried zipping it while not wearing it and it was still as difficult.","I think it would have worked if I had a third set of hands.","My husband tried to zip it while I held it, but still no luck.",":("
"4.0","The cut of this top is very unflattering and the fabric feels extremely cheap.","Im sending it back after just trying it on :/ maybe it looks better on a more petite person."
"4.0","I wish I could say I loved it, but honestly, I didnt even end up wearing it to my event.","Very pretty color, though."
"4.0","After reading all of the reviews, I thought this dress would be perfect for a black tie wedding.","I really wanted to love this dress!","I usually wear a 4 or a 6 and the 6 fit perfectly.","However, this dress has a really thick lining and is a little longer than it should be (and Im really tall).","The cut of the dress makes it flare too much at the hips, making my bottom half look MUCH wider than it is.","The thick lining + long length + flare made this dress a disaster for me.","My husband (nicely) agreed that the cut was terrible.","Probably best for a really straight body type.","Im returning it but thankfully RTR is overnighting me another option!","Thanks, RTR :)"
"4.0","The dress was rather unflattering, the length of the skirt did not hit me anywhere near where it is on the model.","It went past my knees.","Also, the sleeves were too long and had to be rolled up (there was about 5 of extra fabric)."
"4.0","I wasnt thrilled about this top, but only due to the style.","I rented it as an everyday piece as part of my unlimited subscription.","Sweater is thick and obviously high quality.","Very cute pattern.","Cut is fitted so if you prefer a looser look, definitely size up.","I found the neckline to be a bit too chunky, too."
"4.0","I WORE THIS TO AN AUTO SHOW BLACK TIE.","THE DRESS WAS VERY HEAVY AND NOT NECESSARILY AS FLATTERING AS IT APPEARS ON MODEL.","I ALSO THOUGHT THE DRESS RAN LONG AND I AM 56 AND HAD TO WEAR HIGHER HEELS.","TOP/BUST SEEMED STRETCHED OUT.","COULD BE A PRETTIER DRESS IF IT FIT BETTER FOR ME PERSONALLY."
"4.0","The top of the dress was cut perfectly for my busy size (36D).","It was tight without being restrictive.","The bottom, however was very unforgiving and showed every curve, the flattering and unflattering ones.","I should have picked a larger size and tighter spanx.","I did not wear this dress for the event I ordered it for."
"4.0","I was unable to wear this dress because it was too large.","It gapped nearly 1 in the bust and torso.","If I had to reorder, I would choose the 6L and the 4L.","Its also plenty long.","I had 1.5 heels and that would have barely made the dress far enough off the ground to walk in."
"4.0","I ordered a medium because I was afraid the small would be too short (and they did not have the small in stock).","The medium was a little too big, when usually Im a 6 in dresses.","It was also not as flattering as I wouldve expected.","Nothing special.","The cut outs are barely noticeable.","If youre looking for a very simple, comfortable, dress...Then youll be satisfied."
"4.0","The neckline is a lot higher than it looks in the picture, which is fine but not what I was expecting.","The coral material reminded me of something I wore back in the late 90s (and not in a good way).","I thought the dress looked really interesting and different online so I figured I would try it as part of unlimited and it still looked interesting in person, just not close up.","The fit was really good though!","And it has pockets!"
"4.0","This dress is SO pretty.","I could have take a really flattering picture if I had turned to an angle.","HOWEVER knowing you dont always have the perfect angle in a crowd, I took it like this.","It almost gives the appearance of shoulder pads.","I dont mind wearing conservative clothes and that is how I probably feel most comfortable, but this dress looked almost like a costume in how conservative it looked.","I think with my long hair down, that emphasized the feel.","It is pretty, and the size was right, but it wasnt a good fit for me."
"4.0","I ordered a size up and it was still snug.","It also ran short.","Im 54 for reference.","Didnt end up wearing"
"4.0","The dress fit and the style is beautiful.","The problem is that the actual color of the dress does not match the color of the garment online.","This dress is traffic cone bright.","It is such a beautiful dress, but the color of the dress is unflattering."
"4.0","I really didnt like this dress - I sent it back before wearing it.","It didnt have much room in the chest and it was so shapeless I thought it would be cute for a maternity dress, but very unflattering otherwise."
"4.0","Loved the look of the dress but it ran very small and the liner for the taffeta bottom was a lot shorter than I expected it to be.","Overall, cute in theory but at least on my body not so good in exicution."
"4.0","While the color is beautiful, the fit of this dress did not work for me.","This is my second attempt with Robert Rodriguez and perhaps its my body type, but the mid-section and back were both very loose and unflattering.","If you have a tight body and want to show it off, I wouldnt recommend this dress.","It made my waist and my chest disappear, so I just looked baggy.","Perhaps the 2 would have been a better fit, but I imagine it would have still been a stiff fit and not something I would want to wear all day."
"4.0","I ordered this dress in hopes of wowing my friends and my boyfriends coworkers at his military ball.","Maybe its because Im short or maybe the heels werent  high enough but I felt so uncomfortably short.","The dress was really long on me and I kept tripping.","Also, I just didnt like the fit of the dress on my pear shaped body.","Again, I think it had something to do with the length of the dress.","Overall, it was pretty but I didnt feel glam.","Order at your own risk I suppose."
"4.0","Didnt wear, too boxy and extremely heavy material.","Would be a good if you are always cold or to simply wear if you are outdoors."
"4.0","This dress runs small - I rented it in a small after reading other reviews and found the dress to be too tight and unflattering.","I didnt even end up wearing it.","The fit was uncomfortable and would not have been work appropriate.","Perhaps I would have like it if I had sized up.","The material is thick and stretchy."
"4.0","Very darling dress, but I didnt end up wearing it.","the bust in the 2 fit perfect (I am usually a 2 up top), but the hips were so large it made me look awkwardly pear shaped.","The bottom of the dress balloons out and stays out.","I wouldnt recommend unless you are already pear-shaped and need the exrtra room in the hips."
"4.0","this dress is very fun in person, the sequins are all different colors.","however I was unable to wear it because it was much too big and baggy.","I normally wear an XS in Mark + James but I tried a S in this dress and it ran big.","I would recommend getting your usual size and one down."
"4.0","I loved the top of this dress.","It was too long and the bottom is not fitted enough so it looks awkward.","I was not able to wear it."
"4.0","This didnt fit like the other HL dresses Ive rented.","Neither the small or medium I ordered seemed to fit right or compliment my body....Maybe it has to do with the higher neckline or the wave pattern on the bias????","Not really sure, but not my favorite rental."
"4.0","Rented for a formal at the beach, but the longer sleeves felt constricting and the slip is pretty thick- I dont think I would have been comfortable.","Pretty conservative."
"4.0","I tried it on before the trip and the dress does not really have a waist, it kind of goes straight down, maybe because I have small breasts.","It was baggy, an extra small might have fit better."
"4.0","I typically wear a 4-6 in dresses.","I ordered a size 6 in this dress.","The top and bottom were very small; I couldnt even zip it!","The waist, however, fit well.","Strange."
"4.0","I ordered this dress as a back-up dress.","But was hoping to wear to to a second event the following day.","Usually wear a 6, ordered this in an 8 because it looked short even on model.","The dress was beautiful  but way too short.","The sleeves fit well and no fashion tape was needed to hold the back of the dress in place.","The fabric was also thick enough that I would have been comfortable without wearing a bra.","Unfortunately the dress was so short the scalloped edge barely covered my booty.","Would recommend for petite/short body types only."
"4.0","I am slightly broad shouldered & a 34C.","The medium was too big in the armpit area.","I am fit with an hourglass shape but it was too much material for my figure.","The fabric was thick and the dress felt bulky.","I didnt end up wearing it.","But I think this is specific to my body type."
"4.0","Did not wear because this is an oddly-fitting dress.","I have a long waist and small chest and neither the S nor the M worked at all.","If you’re a shorter-waisted, long legged, busty Barbie, it will work for you."
"4.0","I was excited for this dress but when I tried it on it was way too short, as in I would have had to pull it down in the back if I walked up stairs.","I had my friend who is a size 4 try it on and it was too short on her as well- we both have wider hips so I think maybe this dress would be good on someone with less curves.","I sent it back- thank goodness for the backup!"
"4.0","this top was mega cute, but i couldnt even button it.","ordered a large and i have a small bust.","it also was way too short, basically a crop top, couldnt wear it :("
"4.0","This dress is very cute and not too short - but it is snug.","Theres a lot of stretch in the fabric, but for someone with a larger bust (like me) it can feel a bit tight up there.","I liked the small peplum, it wasnt too much and added a nice bit of detail to the dress.","The print is bold and bright and was perfect for a night out on the town for my sisters bachelorette party."
"4.0","the dress is incredibly weighty for being a short dress.","the fabric is nice and thick, but the arm holes were gaping, while the waist was appropriately fitted.","I wasnt able to wear it."
"4.0","I was very excited to wear this dress to a friends winter wedding.","The material was thick enough, but the sizing was very strange.","The 4 was far too small in the bust, but fit nicely everywhere else.","I tried on the 6, which was enormous in the chest and the straps were very long.","RTR did not include fashion tape with this rental, so I made do on by own, but it was a very disappointing rental."
"4.0","Ive worn many many many Medium/6/8 jumpsuits at 510.","This one didnt come close to fitting my leg - the length came barely below my knee and was very tight around my thigh/crotch area.","Very disappointing for an elegant style."
"4.0","The jumpsuit fit perfectly - to the point where I was almost going to wear it - BUT the white was so grey/dirty that I couldnt do it.","I should have listened to some of the more recent reviews.","I would not rent again for the sole reason that the white is no longer white to the point where it clearly looked worn."
"4.0","MUCH Shorter than the pictures reflect, both sides had puckered and popped seams."
"4.0","I ordered this as my back up dress.","I didnt end up wearing it.","I have broader shoulders and as a result, the top just didnt hang right,  I didnt even try with the buttons.","The body of it seemed true to size, but I think the top will fit a smaller shouldered woman better."
"4.0","I am only an A-cup, but my chest/back is pretty broad, and this dress did not suit me well at all.","The snap wouldnt stay, and kept popping open, and it was extremely tight around my shoulders and in the arm holes.","I really wanted this one to fit, but unfortunately, it was a no-go."
"4.0","I am usually a 0... sine having a baby Ive been 2 mayyybe 4.","The 6 was tight.","The fit was also tough for someone who has a smaller waist and curves- the dress bunched so much in the middle- too bad because its a beautiful dress!"
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress after all the positive reviews, but I dont think it was for me.","The length was a little awkward; Im 57 and it fell somewhere between tea length and ankle length.","The waist fit great, but the top was way too loose.","Im not sure if it was a problem with my shoulders or chest, but the straps kept falling off and the whole top of the dress would come with it!","I had to keep a shawl over me all night.","Aside from the weird fit issues, the dress itself was really pretty... just wish I could have shown it off."
"4.0","Very low cut- definitely dont recommend if youre large chested!","The tie did not secure the top enough to make this comfortable to wear.","Wasnt impressed with the dress overall, and the material isnt great for a black tie event."
"4.0","I loved the dress itself, it fit snugly, but not binding, and would have been warm and perfect for the winter event I went to..","Unfortunately, on me, the neoprene pointed out flaws I didnt even know I had.","Guess I need to work out more!","I decided not to wear it to the event.","I would not take a picture of me in it."
"4.0","Because of the cutouts in the dress, it pushes your belly skin out a little bit and even though I am a size 0, it still made me self-conscious.","The skirts shape was also a little wonky at the bottom, probably from being packaged.","I ended up exchanging it for another dress at the RTR Georgetown storefront."
"4.0","the dress is cute but definitely cut for a petite person.","The chest darts were way above my actual chest and the waist was high.","I ended up not wearing it since the darts fell so strangely."
"4.0","This is a beautiful dress, but please order up on size as it runs small.","The skirt was not too pouffy."
"4.0","Nice material, but shape of the shirt was not slimming on me."
"4.0","I read some of the comments/saw it ran small, so I ordered a size up (Im normally a 4) and even that was WAY too tight in the hips.","Its just a poor fit overall."
"4.0","It runs large"
"4.0","I rented this as my backup dress and this one was also very tight.","Again the refund process with RTR is hassle free and I even got an email apologizing for the delay in the refund.....it was valentines day weekend, I can only imagine how busy it was.","All in all I am still a very happy customer and cant wait for my next event to rent!"
"4.0","I rented two dresses.","I adored this one and it fit like a glove everywhere but the chest.","Very tight in my chest-I am a 38D.","I do have broad shoulders and consider myself chesty in general.","I typically have trouble finding things that fit my whole chest, not just breasts.","But this made me look like I duct taped my boobs down just like Christina Ricci in Now and Then :)"
"4.0","Didnt care for the fit or pattern"
"4.0","perhaps this needed to be steamed, but the dress was far too poofy.","it was like a cupcake.","ive worn a few other rowley dresses that are this style and not one has fit so oddly.","im typically btwn a 2 and a 4 but always a 4 with rowley.","the waist was a tiny bit tighter than  i rem, but i cldve easily gained some weight.","either way, the pockets were nice, materials and design were interesting, but maybe because it was thinner or a diff structure i found it to be unflattering."
"4.0","I ordered a size 8, and it was too large over all.","I knew I would be fussing with it all night, so I passed.","The fabric is VERY thin also."
"4.0","Couldnt wear it"
"4.0","It was super tight around the hips, and then really baggy in the chest (and Im not a small-chested gal).","Well-made dress and pretty color, just a really weird fit.","Not great for shorties either - not the most flattering length.","Also, the flappy sleeves were overwhelming on my petite frame."
"4.0","The dress ran large and was not a great fit for me.","I ended up not wearing it in the end."
"4.0","I did not think this was a great dress for my body type.","I am 55 and 145 pounds.","It was way too long and much too big in the waist.","This dress would be much better suited for someone at least 57 or taller.","The material was nice, but the detail on the neck kept falling down.","I was very excited for this dress as I loved the colors and design, unfortunately it just did not live up to my expectations."
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress, but the material was way too weird.","It fits true to size.","I returned this and didnt wear it at all."
"4.0","I wore this to a bridal shower, and was underwhelmed with it.","I give this dress 2 out of 5 because it was just kind of blah.","Thank goodness I rented the Kate Spade Out on the Town necklace to jazz it up...it saved the outfit!","It is a pretty shade of pink, but too long for my liking.","I cant say Ill rent it again."
"4.0","Cute pattern, but fits like a sack.","Felt like a square"
"4.0","Pretty but too small.","Couldnt wear."
"4.0","I am 510 and usually between a size 2 and 4.","I ordered a 4 and a 6 based on the reviews and wouldve worn the 6.","I was way too tall to wear this...I think you couldnt be taller than 57 to wear this comfortably.","Additionally, the way this was stitched together from the top portion and the pants made this kind of poochy in front and wasnt flattering from the side.","My boyfriend said that looks like pajamas when I had it on, which is definitely not the reaction I was going for!","Ended up wearing  backup outfit.","Also, the zipper was really tough to get up and down.","I think youd need someone to unzip you before you could use the bathroom!","Plan accordingly!"
"4.0","I would definitely recommend this dress for girls with an athletic build.","However, if you arent looking to add extra curve, this may not be the dress you are looking for.","The way the fabric gathers in the front and drapes over the hips REALLY brings your eye to that area.","The lining is thicker, therefore I would recommend this dress for the colder months (New Years Eve...)."
"4.0","Pretty bright red, but I felt like there was too much fabric.","Ended up looking a little bulky on my body.","I typically wear between and 0 and 2, and the 0 felt too large to wear.","In terms of the length, I am 58 and the 0R length would have worked had I chosen to wear the dress.","Dress definitely runs long."
"4.0","I needed a white dress for my shower so I thought this was a happy medium.","The dress came in impeccable condition (as always, thank you RTR) and felt great.","When I put it on something was significantly lacking.","There was no waist!","It definitely needs a belt and I thought adding a belt was too distracting.","I would say its NOT close to the picture - leaves a lot to be desired.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","I liked the dress, but I just didnt like how it fit - The back was obviously backless, so the front was was fine, but the back was super loose and I kept having to adjust the shoulder part... Maybe if I had a bigger chest it might have filled better making the back tighter.","I didnt feel comfortable with it being loose so I resorted to wearing one of my sisters dresses.",":("
"4.0","This top is cute in theory - I am not showing much yet, but what little bump I do have threw it off.","So if you have any belly at all (baby or not) I would go a size up!"
"4.0","The chest is large and you cant wear a bra.","Otherwise cute dress."
"4.0","Shoulders fit weird and rides up when you walk.","Im short, and this was short on me!","Colors and back are awesome, look great...but hard to wear.","Size up!"
"4.0","I usually wear a size 2 or Small.","The smallest size in this brand would not fit me.","Beautiful dress... Just not good for thin frame."
"4.0","Cute print but the puffy sleeves and neck tie thing had more of an 80s vibe than I expected from the picture.","And, it was so loose that I had to position the tie just right to avoid showing the top of my bra.","That worked for a while until the top button slipped open and I inadvertently exposed myself to an intern.","I would avoid this one if you are petite on top."
"4.0","This was not as luxe looking as I thought it would be.","The fabric is super itchy and I had to wear long sleeves underneath.","Just average."
"4.0","Its a beautiful didnt end up wearing because it fit much too small around my rib cage.","Id go a size up!"
"4.0","The fit of this dress was strange.","The top portion and also the bottom fit loosely, while the waistband was very tight.","Luckily, I had a back-up dress of my own to wear.","Good thing, because a friend of my cousins wore this exact dress to the wedding!","It seemed to fit her similarly to the way it fit me, so maybe its the dress and not us.","Also, the color is more of an orange-red if that helps."
"4.0","This dress arrived today and is not at all flattering for my shape.","You can probably see my body info, but Im 56 and a size 14/16.","This dress made me feel like a chubby figure skater.","My observations: the lace pattern is large, therefore making my large bust look even larger; the pockets dont lie flat, making my hips poof out (and my hips arent large to begin with, so it gave me a boxier look).","Looking at photo reviews, I see that the dress *can* look great on plus-sized ladies, but it just did not look good on my apple shape.","The dress itself is beautiful and I love the gold/nude lining, but it just didnt work for me."
"4.0","Very elegant, fitted dress.","Suitable for a cocktail party or conservative wedding.","Not work appropriate."
"4.0","I got this as part of my unlimited membership because I wanted to try something out of my comfort zone.","I didnt love it.","The dress was lined and the print was not better in person.","The back cutout was very flattering on my body type, but the dress was also a little short."
"4.0","I was swimming in the XS and Im usually a 4-6.","Found fabric to be itchy on bare skin, so would only wear with a long sleeve top underneath."
"4.0","Fit in to the size 6 and it fit well in all areas except my hips.","I wouldnt recommend this for anyone with any kind of booty or hips.","The pockets stuck out making it look awkward."
"4.0","My dress size is pretty consistent.","I always wear either an XS or S, depending on the brand/designer.","I ordered an XS and S, since receiving two sizes for the price of one was an option (GREAT idea to allow that, by the way.","Thank you!).","My event fell on the Saturday after Christmas, so I had to elect to receive my dress on Christmas Eve.","It showed up around 3:30 on Christmas Eve.","Luckily, I tried it on immediately because the XS was way too big.","I called RTR, and they informed me that we were past the cutoff time to receive a dress in time for my event, so I ran to Nordstrom Rack and bought four dresses to error on the safe side, since I knew nothing would be open Christmas Day, the day before my event.","I gave this rental two stars because I feel the customer service I received was good.","They answered quickly on Christmas Eve and informed me that receiving a dress from them in time was not an option with the holiday, giving me enough time to go out and get a new dress.","The rental process was very smooth and easy.","Since the dress didnt fit, I will be receiving a refund for all but the shipping expense for the dress.","There was a small rip on the seam of the dress I received.","I guess that was not expected, but the dress didnt fit anyway, so it didnt matter to me.","How the dress fit:Great from my waist down.","The sleeves fit perfectly.","The dress had the perfect amount of stretch to it.","It fit decently around my chest.","The mid section of the dress from my chest to my hips was VERY large and looked baggie, which is why I chose to return it and wear something else.","I am not sure if the dress was made to fit that way or if it was stretched out from previous rentals."
"4.0","I particularly did not like this skirt.","Although the size was a true XS, it fit strangely around my waist.","It didnt lay properly.","The way it layed, showed the tag.","I tried to roll that part of the skirt inward so it wouldnt show, but to no avail.","I have a similar sweater to the one the model is wearing and was going to wear the sweater inside the skirt but couldnt because of the above mentioned - so I wore the sweater outwards."
"4.0","This dress is very forgiving in that it is stretchy and covers you like a poncho.","Not super flattering on women with larger chests & bigger hips like me.","I also felt a bit washed out in it."
"4.0","This dress was great quality and nice material, however, it just didnt fit me great.","I was really uncomfortable with it during the entire wedding ceremony and ended up stopping somewhere before the reception to buy fashion tape.","After taping all the way up and down the top part, I was comfortable enough to keep the dress on for the reception.","Im not sure if my bust size was just not right for this dress or what but being a size 2 it was definitely hard to fill this dress for me!"
"4.0","This could be a great dress, but the arms are unbelievably tight.","I have skinny arms and it was still to tight to wear comfortably.","The back is also pretty low cut, so if youre wearing to work youll probably need a jacket."
"4.0","These pants did not fit as they appear in the photo whatsoever.","I rented my usual size and even if I had gone up a size, they were extremely high waisted (covered my belly button).","They were also very tight fitting.","I have very skinny legs and these fit more like leggings than pants.","They were also very short.","I am 59  and the regular length hit at my ankles.","I did not wear."
"4.0","This did not any any stretch- did not close over my chest.","Too tight and uncomfortable."
"4.0","Dress runs very small.","I am usually a 14/16 - I ordered this as a backup dress in size 18 thinking it would work considering others had commented on how small it runs.","I was able to wear the dress but it was not comfortable at all.","The sleeves were way too tight and there was hardly any stretch to them.","Its a beautiful dress but was ultimately a complete waste of $$."
"4.0","Did not look good on, very low cut but not in a flattering way, did not wear it"
"4.0","I ordered both a small and medium.","Both were extremely large in the arms.","I would have had to taken up the strap three inches to keep it from having a huge gap near my under arm.","If I could have made my own alterations I would have loved to wear it, but I opted to just pass on it and wear a dress I already owned."
"4.0","cute top but the bottom layer definitely needs ironing.","stiffer fit; not for larger chested women."
"4.0","I wear a size 8, but ordered the 10 and it is so tight around the ribcage, sent it back and hopefully going to get the 12."
"4.0","Feels a bit plastic-y and not the most flattering of fits."
"4.0","I ordered a 2L but I believe that a 2R came isntead.","I am 59 and the dress didnt even come down to my ankles.","I looked horrible but the stylists came to rescue!","Looks better on models than it did on me."
"4.0","I typically wear a size 4, but this dress was wayyyy too big in the bust.","I tried to wear pushup bras, but it wasnt enough.","I ended up not wearing the dress because it didnt fit well.","I would def recommend renting a smaller size!!!!!!!!!!","!"
"4.0","The shoulder pads and overall heaviness of the dress were not flattering on my athletic frame.","I ended up not wearing the dress."
"4.0","Unfortunately I had to send this back without wearing it.","As other reviewers state the fabric is extremely itchy on the inside.","Ive worn other dresses by this designer in the same fabric without an issue, but my skin could hardly stand 5 min in this dress, my skin was flushed and irritated and I had to get out of the dress quickly!"
"4.0","Really short and does not have much stretch- annoying in the arms and  when I sat down."
"4.0","I rented this dress for a gala and it was nothing like I expected.","The color is gorgeous, but that is about the only benefit for this dress.","The neckline is weird, especially with the little square dip in the middle.","But the worst was the actual skirt of the dress- I felt that I gained 8 inches on my hips.","It made me feel so blah and honestly, really frumpy.","I have 36D breasts and wear size 30 jeans and size 10 suit pants.","Ladies with bigger hips and thighs should think twice about this gown.","Tall, slender girls- this dress is right up your alley!"
"4.0","It felt HUGE.","The lace up part seemed really large and in the way.","It wasnt the style I thought I was going for.","I would suggest you order a size down or your smallest size."
"4.0","The dress was a little bit long but other than that the fit was great.","The HUGE PROBLEM with the dress was that the seam where the zipper was was busted open, so we had another dress shipped to us by 12:00pm the day of the party which was great customer service, but yet again the seam was busted in the same place, so it must just be a design flaw."
"4.0","couldnt zip it up"
"4.0","Another renter commented on how wide the shoulder were and that is where it really goes wrong.","I love a drop waist dress but this one sadly an unfortunate mess."
"4.0","I ended up changing out of this dress and into something more comfortable because the fabric was just too scratchy for me.","I also wasnt wild about the appearance of the ruching -- it wasnt very flattering on my bod."
"4.0","This is a beautiful jumpsuit, but it is SO long.","I am 55 and tried it on with my tallest heels and it was still inches too long.","Couldnt wear.","If youre super tall - go for it!"
"4.0","Leggings ran really small, never wore them.","The top is very translucent but soft.","The sweatshirt is awesome."
"4.0","I couldnt wear this because the zipper in the back was extremely difficult to zip.","Very cute but bulky."
"4.0","I understand that I am renting a dress and it has been worn before.","This dress however, has tiny sequins and I could see that quite a few areas were missing.","There were also pulls like everywhere.","The dress looked amazing from far away but up close you could tell.","I felt like anyone standing behind me at the wedding could see.","It was also significantly see through, wear tan undergarments or else."
"4.0","Love this dress, but it was super long.","I should have gone with the 2P as the 2R went past the floor on me.","Being 56 is a weird height, I suppose.","Also, the bust was suuuuuuuper huge on me and baggy.","Had I rented this for a special occassion or an event and it wasnt through Unlimited, I would have been super bummed.","Luckily, with unlimited, I was able to get something else ..."
"4.0","This jumpsuit is great in theory but doesnt work in reality.","While the length of the pants fit perfectly (I was very afraid they would be too long) and the bodice fit just as well, the bust area was way too revealing.","This jumpsuit is cut much lower than the picture presents.","Additionally, the fabric is not as stiff as it should be so I couldnt wear it because not only was my strapless, plunge bra visible but I would have been terrified of one of the girls popping out if I didnt wear a bra!","The bust area is very poorly constructed for such a low-cut piece."
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing this- it was very boxy and structured.","Not drapey like I had hoped.","The material is very scratchy."
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing this because I looked like SpongeBob.","The pattern and design are interesting, but the cut was just not for me.","It might be better for someone with broader shoulders or a smaller chest."
"4.0","This dress was very long.","It has a bodice that has some boning in it which helps it stay up.","Unfortunately it was not what I was looking for, I wanted more of a wow factor."
"4.0","Runs small.","I am normally a 6 and the 8 was closer to a size 6"
"4.0","Love the color and the feel of the fabric.","The 6r fit fine around the waist, but the top was very loose and gaping.","I am a 36B and the girls were falling out each time I lifted an arm or turned my torso."
"4.0","The fit of this dress did not work for me.","Typically, A-line dresses work for me as but the wasitline was somewhat baggy and he ruffles on the skirt made this unflattering on my figure.","The material and style are beautiful so I was really disappointed this didnt work.","Gave this 2 stars due to the beautiful material but I couldnt wear this."
"4.0","I got this dress for a bachelorette party in vegas and it was huge.","I couldnt wear it I would recommend going down a size or 2"
"4.0","No matter what bra you wear, this outfit makes your breasts look like they are lower and closer to the midline.","It is not a flattering outfit for curvy women."
"4.0","It did not fit well- the cross shoulder did not lay flat (maybe not good for bigger chests?!).","Also, the material wasnt very heavy and showed everything!"
"4.0","I really wanted to love this dress, but it did not work for me at all.","There were some issues with sizing when I ordered.","I ordered a 2L and wanted a 4L as a back up, but 4L was unavailable.","I ordered a 4R to see if it would work.","The day before my dresses were to ship, RTR notified me that the 2L was unavailable, and they could only ship the 4R.","When I tried it on, I couldnt walk in the dress!","The mermaid hit me at the thighs, so I was not able to extend my legs at all to walk.","It was about 2 inches too short when I was barefoot.","The dress also felt very tight through the bust and hips, so even if it had been long enough, I would have been uncomfortable.","I dont know if a tall size would have fixed these issues, but 4R was definitely not the size for me."
"4.0","When I saw it on other people in photos, it was beautiful.","The lace was so elegant and classy.","I am typically a 0 or 2, so I decided to order a 2 in this dress.","When I received it and tried it on, the sleeve holes were so tight and constricting, I could barely lift my arms!","The lace was very pretty, but it too was constricting!","The dress was beautiful- just dont wear it to an event where you are going to lift your arms above your waist (i.e.","dancing!",")."
"4.0","I tried this dress on before my actual renal date.","It was beautiful, but very long and bit big."
"4.0","This was my first choice dress.","Both the 4R and 6R were too short to wear.","In my mind, the hem should graze the floor or the very point of your shoes at worst.","Im only 55 and tried it with my lowest heels (3-4 inches).","I was unable to wear either dress with this combined height.","Also, while this dress looks gorgeous and elegant on the model, it was pretty matronly on me.","I have an hourglass figure and it didnt hug tight enough in the waist and really took away from curves and made me look short and stumpy.","Its a beautiful dress in photos and in person but just not for me in fit."
"4.0","Im tall and thin...but I think that this dress style doesnt work for me because I dont have a defined waist and the dress hits me too high on the chest (where the waist is supposed to be).","I love DVF styles...Im just going to have to quit trying becuase they dont work for me.",":-("
"4.0","dress was really good but it was not for short fat girl like me"
"4.0","Sadly this dress was unwearable.","It looked like a really unflattering sack.","The ruffles on the chest added volume, and made me look much heavier.","The pictures dont even accurately represent how bad this dress looked in person.","I think this would only work for someone very thin, with a small chest."
"4.0","Ordered this dress as my primary choice for a wedding, however upon arrival it looked more navy than black.","Not a bad dress if youre looking for something a bit edgy, and are not particular about fabric  Also, definitely take advantage of the long length option if planning to wear heels."
"4.0","No stretch.","Sleeves are too long."
"4.0","I have a bit of a booty but a small waist/stomach and the middle of the dress was loose yet the bottom kept bunching up.","The top was also snug across my chest.The fabric was also not very forgiving so I would suggest Spanx if you have any curves."
"4.0","Beware, this dress runs EXTREMELY small.","I have consistently worn a size 4 with all prior RTR rentals (and in every-day clothing) without ever having to use my back-up size, but Id say that this 4 was barely a 2 in any other brand.","As soon as I took it out of the bag I knew it was going to be a problem.","I was able to wear my back-up size 6, which just barely closed and was very tight.","There is ZERO give in the fabric so it will not stretch at all during wear.","Id recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes for a decent fit.","It is an absolutely beautiful dress, I just wish the sizing was consistent."
"4.0","Im 53 and wear a 8-10, so normally have no issues with length in dresses.","Id hoped to wear this dress for work, but it was way too short.","I felt as through given the material (fairly thick), and general style, it seems best suited for a business casual atmosphere, but the length makes it inappropriate for that."
"4.0","This dress is beautiful in person,  if you have hips, thighs and but this dress is NOT for you!","I was able to get the dress over my head and waist and thats where the dress stopped."
"4.0","The dress was thick and didnt move with my body.","The cut out seemed to bring attention to an odd spot on my body."
"4.0","Fit true to size, and I loved it, but there is a built in corset and the metal boning was coming through the fabric and was quite painful.","I tried covering with band-aids, but it didnt really help.","Otherwise it was a great outfit, and I loved it."
"4.0","im 59 and i rented the long, the dress came up to my ankles."
"4.0","This was my backup dress, and I didnt end up wearing it.","The dress fit perfectly up top, it was the length that was an issue.","The inner layer of the dress was at a perfect length when wearing heels.","The outer chiffon layer was at least 6 inches longer and incredibly voluminous.","I thought of possibly using double sided tape to hoist it up but the top layer wasnt circular but cut in a wavy pattern, so any alteration would have looked ridiculous.","I was disappointed because the dress was a beautiful pink and fit wonderfully.","Just wish that top layer was flush with the bottom layer.","Beware short girls!"
"4.0","Didnt wear this dress because it was super short even without shoes on.","Definitely get a long if youre over 5-6"
"4.0","too large, unflattering."
"4.0","Great color and pattern.","Sorry that I wasnt able to wear it - the fit in the waist was too small."
"4.0","This dress didnt make sense to me.","The front slit was at an odd angle and the side slit looked like a loose piece of fabric.","Do not rent this dress."
"4.0","No stretch and very small.","I normally wear a 10 and the XL dit not fit.","Could not wear dress."
"4.0","I wish this dress fit but unfortunately the top did not fit my body right.","I have a short torso and really long legs, and the top of the dress went way too low on my body.","I would not recommend this dress if you have a short torso like me!","The fabric and how the dress lays is amazing though!","I just wish it would have fit."
"4.0","Love this dress - i normally wear a small (and a 4/6) but sized up to a M just in case since it was my first time with this designer.","Could barely get away with the dress is was so small - fit more like a 2/4.","Fabric has zero give and is cut for top-heavy girls.","Size normally if you are boy-framed or busty with narrow hips, size up 1 for hourglass, size up two for pears like me :) Dont rent if above an 8/10 but will be great for petites."
"4.0","This is beautiful coral dress.","It did not work for me because of the pattern and overly pleated skirt.","I feel that this will work best with a any shape other than hourglass.","Patter is busy on top and busy on the bottom and the middle just gets lost.","Hope this helps somewhat.","Its true to size."
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress.","and I did while it was on the hanger, however, the fit was just odd.","The arms and bust were tight, the waist was too big, and the hips were WAY too tight.","I think this dress would fit best on someone narrow through the bust, waist, and hips.","I ended up not being able to wear it at all because of the fit.","The fabric is very thick and seems like it would hold you in, if thats what you need.","The ends of the sleeves and the bottom hem of the dress is not hemmed, which I found odd."
"4.0","I am 4 1/2 months pregnant and had a wedding to attend.","Based on the reviews I thought this dress would be perfect and bump friendly.","Unfortunately the top half of the dress was a little too tight with the boning and uncomfortable for me and there was so much material on the bottom half that it made me look three times my actual size.","It wasnt very flattering on me at all and I did not end up wearing it."
"4.0","very sexy, tight, form fitting dress.","loved the cutouts.","however the zipper bunched on the side and looked wrong, didnt end up wearing the dress because of this."
"4.0","Its hard to shop based of the pictures of these models.","They all have slim bodies and no boobs.","I, on the other hand, have 38c cups and hips.","This jumpsuit was not a great fit for me."
"4.0","Unfortunately this dress did not work for me at all.","I generally wear a 2 or 4 (thats what I thought I ordered, turns out my order was for a 4 & 6 but I was sent 2 & 4 somehow....) but the 4 would barely even zip up on me.","When I did get it zipped it was less than flattering!","However, the dress is beautiful and the material is great, very sturdy.","The color was vibrant, but not obnoxious.","This was going to be the dress for my own 30th birthday dinner party, needless to say I was really bummed that it didnt work and also in a bit of a panic as it was only two days away!","The team at RTR was FANTASTIC and helped me out right away.","Sadly they did not have this dress available in a 6, so they sent me another style that is similar.","This was not an ideal first go with RTR, but theyve been so wonderful that I cant wait to use them again!"
"4.0","Didnt end up wearing.","It was too small."
"4.0","I loved the pictures of this dress.","Thought the style, color and everything would look amazing for a wedding I was attending.","And even though both sizes fit well ( I ordered a 10 and a 12), the material of the dress is VERY heavy and BULKY.","Really BULKY.","Im a petite 54 and it just swallowed me up.","It was a such a disappointment because this was my first rental and I was super excited about the dress.","Will rent again tho!"
"4.0","I was a bit disappointed in this vest.","It runs very big and you will need to size down at least one size.","But even then, I did not think it was flattering as it had a bulky fit.","The material is also scratchy, especially around the collar where it hits your neck."
"4.0","cute and comfy"
"4.0","This dress was too loose in the top, and the bottom was too wide around the hips.","I think I am too petite for this brand... their clothes are always a little too large and wide for me."
"4.0","to tight in the bust"
"4.0","I rented this dress despite the lack of reviews, and I was sadly disappointed.","The dress was too short (about as short as it looks on the model) and ran very small.","The cutouts hit in the wrong places and it was not an overall flattering look.","The color was very nice, however.","I ended up not wearing this dress for my sorority semi-formal.","Despite this, I will definitely still rent from RTR in the future."
"4.0","I got the back up dress, but the first was such a great fit and selection.","I never wore this dress.","I probably wouldnt be renting it again, just because it wasnt a real show stopper like the longer version."
"4.0","I did not wear either of the sizes of this dress - it looked very frumpy.","This was rented for my sons baptism in church.","Pretty dress, just didnt work."
"4.0","This is a beautiful piece but was too small for me so I couldnt wear it.","I recommend sizing up!"
"4.0","Its a gorgeous dress but the top part gapes to the point that even a safety pin probably wouldn’t fix it.","I’m a D cup and I think I’d have to wear a cami underneath.","Unfortunately I’m on vacation so I ended up sending it back without wearing it.","Shame because it’s a beautiful dress."
"4.0","Dress is great white shade and sequins are beautiful and not too sparkly!","Material is quite thick which can be seen as pro or con, for me it was pro.","My main issue and reason I did not wear was how snug at waist it was.","This fit was unflattering for me, I have hourglass figure (larger hips and bust).","Just be aware that it will hug hips and waist, order size up if possible!"
"4.0","Rented this for NYE party.","Wish it had a little more sparkle.","Ended up being way too casual for what I wanted to wear it to."
"4.0","The dress was tight around the rib cage and I didnt love it.","However, there wasnt anything wrong with the dress...I just didnt love it once I had it on."
"4.0","Very pretty dress but when fully zipped up it was a very tight fit around the bust and arms and kinda hard to breathe in.","I ended up getting a backup dress overnighted to me which was much more appropriate for the wedding."
"4.0","This dress is beautiful but was so incredibly small that I could not zip it up at all.","I will rent it again in a larger size.","Definitely size up 1 or 2 sizes from your normal size."
"4.0","Ran big, and the collar at the neck paired with the ruffles down the front gave it a really strange look.","I didnt find it flattering at all and didnt wear."
"4.0","For my long torso and height this dress ended up being super short!","I couldnt even wear it which was disappointing for sure because I dont like wasting rentals with my Unlimited account...Ill know next time that shift dresses arent for me."
"4.0","I was unable to wear this dress as the bodice was too big on the size 8 and the size 10 was too big all over.","Thankfully I was able to have another dress overnighted."
"4.0","I would have loved to wear this dress to a more classy party too stuffy for NYE.","It did not fit the new years eve event i was attending i thought the back lace  was completely  when i got the dress i found out it was not so I didnt get a chance to wear it.i would love to get the chance to  wear this dress to a more suited affair.."
"4.0","Fit was well but it had too much tulle for me."
"4.0","I loved how comfortable and flattering this dress was.","But I gotta say, I didnt feel like a million bucks in it.","Im 34 and it felt sort young for me, like something to wear to a club or party but not a black tie event.","It was very short, in a good way.","But I just wishes it had a slightly higher end feel.","But if youre going for sparkly, flattering fun, then this dress is adorable."
"4.0","If you are 56, *do not*, despite what the RTR size guide says, get a long dress.","Even with 3-4 heels, you will spend the evening stepping on your own gown, waiting for the person next to you to move away because they are stepping on your gown too, or  constantly hiking up the gown to avoid all of the above.","Also, be prepared to spend some quality time with the iron on this one before you put it on - wrinkles are very obvious.","Overall a nice flowing dress, the color is beautiful, but I didnt have a lot of fun wearing it and wouldnt rent it again."
"4.0","This was surprisingly itchy, heavy, and not nearly as sexy as Id hoped.","Made my already-large chest look top heavy."
"4.0","This dress runs small.","It is a pretty dress but is VERY fitted- will show every extra unwanted inch!","Probably great for a night out but was also not formal enough for my event."
"4.0","Would be flattering on a tall slimmer person."
"4.0","I sized up from my normal 14WL to a 16WL recognizing that more space in the bodice and pants would be smart.","It was still so small I couldnt zip it at all.","While Im rather tall (511) my torso is proportional to my body (i.e.","I dont have a long torso); yet when I pulled the straps over my shoulders the crotch of the suit yanked up and I had to hunch just make it fit.","I would have needed to size way up to get it to fit normally.","But it would have been pretty if it had fit!","It was really cool that the pant legs really just look like a skirt!"
"4.0","I am usually a size 2 but was swimming in this dress.","I ended up not wearing this dress."
"4.0","Very beautiful dress, but watch out if you have full hips - under the sheer overlay there is a tight fitting dress that does not have any stretch.","Also, although the description says it can be worn with any normal bra, I dont agree - because the material was so sheer on top, only a strapless bra would really the best."
"4.0","I returned the dress before my event.","The darts were just in the wrong place.","The were above my breasts and very noticeable.","I was MCing all night so did not think I could risk the distraction of the dart issue."
"4.0","RTR had to send me multiple dresses after the ones I ordered didnt fit.","This is one of the ones they sent me and it was the best of the bunch.","The red was beautiful and and it was definitely a show stopper.","However, I had to wear the 10 because the waist was really tight.","I didnt fill out the chest area at all which looked a littler funny.","Luckily I barely knew anyone at the event.","If you have a larger waist and thinner everything else I dont recommend this dress.","The length was perfect though."
"4.0","The fit starts out great but it does stretch a bit as the day goes on so I would suggest possibly sizing down.","Im 57 and it was still a bit long on me so I rolled the waist band up which worked fine, this is probably not a good style for a petite woman.","There are no slits so it isnt the easiest to walk with long strides in.","I wouldnt buy it but I loved renting it since this is the kind of unique look that would get tired wearing over and over again.","I received many compliments at work."
"4.0","the dress runs very small and leaves little room for mobility.","do not rent if you want to dance all night.","size up."
"4.0","I rented this to go to a nightclub in Vegas.","I usually dont wear rompers but I wanted to try one out.","I didnt realize how much sparkle this dress had.","I kinda felt like I had a fight with a glitter bottle and lost.","It was comfortable but every time you went to the bathroom you have to take the whole thing off.","I wore the 6.","The 4 fit too but it came in damaged."
"4.0","I was expecting more from this dress, but was disappointed by the cut and fabric.","Also, the back is open with lace over it, and it has lace cutouts along the sides.","I couldnt tell this detail from the pictures.","Not a good cut for athletic body types."
"4.0","It was teeny tiny.","I didnt exchange it for a larger size because it was, meh."
"4.0","I could not see a size tag on the dress, but it was supposed to be small (Im a solid size 4).","However, the dress that came was so small, I couldnt wear it."
"4.0","I thought this dress looked beautiful in the photos and rented for a summer wedding.","Unfortunately it didnt work for many reasons - it was too small in the bust while the hips were too large, the fabric is on the heavier side and  this type of fabric doesnt look right  for summer wear, and the color is a much brighter purple than it appeared in the photos ( dont like the color).","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","This dress is an interesting one, but I ended up not wearing it.","I tried - I tried it with jeans, leggings, and a mini,  and then the weather got too hot to use it without some type of bottoms (maybe someone in the 20s could, but as a 40 something professional I just could not pull that off).","The material was a bit scratchy even with a light long sleeve t-shirt under it.","I imagine a very hip 20 something could wear this well with killer boots or heels, but it was just not me.","Ended up returning it unworn with the rest of my unlimited shipment.","The material looks much more sparkly in person than in the photo.","And yes, SIZE DOWN as much as you can.","It was very very big on me."
"4.0","Great fit, beautiful fabric!!","but i just had a problem with the length.","the asymmetry is awesome(!","), but the opening is right at my belly button so it looks so awkward.","Unfortunately sending it back!"
"4.0","The dress is beautiful but if you have a chest, dont get it.","It would not zip over my chest."
"4.0","this dress is cute, the size 8 fit perfectly - but the full skirt fell past my knees (54) and was actually unflattering on me as a result."
"4.0","Im 58.","145 lbs.","34 dd.","It was way too tight.","I usually wear 6,8s and mediums.","It was especially tight on my boobs and they were smashed and popping out the sides.","Good length.","Pretty dress.","Couldnt wear it :("
"4.0","I usually wear a size 0 or size 2...","This size 0 dress fit like most size 4 dresses do on me in department stores.","It was just big all over..in the bust, waist and the hips and was not at all flattering.","The length was fine, I suppose..fell to just above my knees.","Additionally the lace around the neck line laid funny, some of it flat against my skin and some sticking up.. Bummer.","I wont be wearing this out of the house.","I agree with other reviews in that the color is a brighter green than in the models photos, but I did like the color.","This dress might work for you if you are taller than me and normally wear a larger size...there is no way this is a true size 0!","Its huge!","Another pro: you can wear a regular nude colored bra with it and the straps wont show."
"4.0","Very cute dress but the top was too big and even with wedges, the dress was way too long."
"4.0","The dress they shipped was very used, it looked like it should be retired.","The color was rubbing off the sequences and the straps were torn, visibly coming apart.","I could not wear this to the event."
"4.0","I was really excited about this dress.","I am normally a size 2 or 4 but read reviews to size down so I got a 0 and a 2 to be safe; even the 0 was big on me!","The dress has very little shape and was not flattering at all.","The length is also very awkward; I am 55, 125 pounds and it went about halfway down my knees and just looks very frumpy.","Thank goodness I also got a backup that I ended up loving!"
"4.0","I gave it the two stars because despite how amazing and gorgeous this dress was, i couldnt get over the issue with the stitching through the chest.","adding a bra helped round them out, but they were still pointy and i just couldnt get over feeling like madonna in them :("
"4.0","This dress makes younger girls look a little bit old which was completely unexpected.","When I finally fit into the size bigger than I usually am, the dress turned out to be extremely unflattering.","There is ribbing on the sides that makes your torso look about 2 inches wider than it actually is, and the tightness around the hips pull in a strange and unsavory way.","I didnt end up wearing the dress, and I wouldnt recommend it."
"4.0","Waaay too short on my 59 frame.","I had to return it."
"4.0","Just not flattering...too tight and the material not comfortable."
"4.0","This dress is like wearing a straight jacket.","It runs small and is quite short.","I ended up not wearing it for my event because I couldnt move my arms.","Pretty color and texture but completely impractical (unless you just want to stand still all night)."
"4.0","Ive been eyeing this dress for months.","It is NOT for small chested women.","I am a true 0 and the cups were huge.","Even when I wore my most padded bra, the cups appeared pointy.","It didnt feel appropriate to wear to a wedding.","The sleeves were really baggy.","I was so sad that it didnt work out but RtR credited my account."
"4.0","It would have been beautiful and easy to dance in given how light the material was.","But, it didnt fit"
"4.0","The flare of the dress came up too high on my waist and did not flatter my figure.","The bust fit was good, and I wouldnt have needed a bra.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","I would have needed to order 2 sizes up for appropriate fit"
"4.0","Beautiful dress but the cut/fit runs so SMALL - this is cut like a size 6 and i couldnt even get the zipper done up!","i can usually squeeze into a size 8 with the proper undergarments, but no way is this dress sized correctly.","Sadly, i didnt get to wear it to my party!",": ("
"4.0","Given the reviews and the photos of other ladies, with what I thought were similar body types to mine (shorter, athletic, gymnast frame) and I was expecting the dress to fit true to size, unfortunately where the dress cinched at the waist was too tight and so I had to find another dress to wear.","Normally size 6 fits me perfectly so this was disappointing to discover."
"4.0","This dress is SUPER unique and fun.","But be prepared to suck in all night!",":) I didnt end up wearing this, because I felt more matador than sexy.","But in the right setting on the right person it could be fantastic!"
"4.0","This dress has a beautiful silhouette but when I received it, it smelled so bad.","Almost like it didnt have a great run through at the dry cleaners.","Im 510 and I felt the arm holes really were cut high up because it was pulling a bit under my arms.","I wouldnt rent this again as there are way too many other options, especially with Tibi to rent."
"4.0","This was my backup dress and I didnt wear it because my first choice was more my style and fit better.","This was my backup dress and I went with my first choice for my nieces wedding.","Pros: The sleeves and waistline are very flattering and the fabric is gorgeous.","I live in San Francisco and weight of the fabric is perfect for cooler weather.","Cons: the actual color (a royal or electric blue) is different than the dress pictured on website model.","For me, it ran small and was uncomfortable for a long event (my nieces wedding).","I also felt it was a tad short for a wedding, was hoping it came closer to the top of the knees.","Also, because of the fabric, this may not be good choice for warm weather."
"4.0","I read the reviews about the waist being too tight.","Pretty much VERY VERY TRUE.","Im not big, but I do have an athletic build (used to swim), and this didnt get bast my rib section.","I was so sad.","Its super cute, but even a large wasnt comfortable.","And Im easily a large, sometimes a medium.","But if you have a small upper body, this will work.","Sizing to an XL, would have been too  large.","Bummed."
"4.0","As a lady with the large bust who loves flowy, non-fitted garments, this one just didnt work.","It didnt hang right and wasnt flattering at all.","Fit was true to size though - no gaping in the buttons."
"4.0","The top was a little big while the rest of the dress was snug.","I had ordered the 14 as well, but the top was much too large while the rest of the dress fit me better I wound up wearing the 12 due to the top."
"4.0","This is my second encounter with rent the runway clothes.","The first time, nothing fit AT ALL and I couldnt wear them.","This skirt fit fine but I am way too short -- (56 -- for it to look festive and elegant.","When I put it on, hoping to wear it with boots and a sparkly top to my own 50th birthday party, I looked like a toddler dressing up for a tea party with her stuffed animals.","So, instead, I wore it with hiking boots and jeans on my birthday hike instead.","That was quite fun."
"4.0","This dress was in rough shape (several beads were hanging by a thread) and it was huge, but I didnt have a backup plan for my bridal shower so I made it work.","Its worth noting that the dress is entirely separate from the sheath/slip underneath.","In hindsight, I should have contacted RTR immediately - now I know what to do.","I think the dress would have been more flattering if it hadnt been so big.","It was modern and yet fit the theme perfectly and it photographed beautifully."
"4.0","thick material form fitting, I ordered an XS and S but should have ordered a M or even L. Size up for sure!"
"4.0","The top of this dress feels too tight compared to how A-Line the body is.","The waist also felt a little high so the A-Line felt overly triangular and slightly shorter than I would have liked.","I chose this dress as a back up because my size wasnt available in another and I didnt wear it.","It looks great on the model but didnt look in proportion on me."
"4.0","Way smaller and tighter than I realized.","Had to use my backup dress."
"4.0","I didnt love this dress and ended up not wearing it.","The material is thick, which is good for fall/winter.","I found it to be too boxy on my curvy frame.","What I loved about the opening in the back was detracted by the fact that the material underneath is a shiny spandex which made the dress look cheap."
"4.0","This fit really awkwardly - -the right side of the slit was about 5 inches higher than the left and it just looked bunchy...I didnt end up wearing it to the event."
"4.0","I read some reviews saying the top was shorter than expected, which I also found to be true.","Otherwise, the fit of the top was ok, but the arm holes were very small.","Overall, I didnt like the fit or the silhouette of this top."
"4.0","This dress fits great.","Its not too short to wear to work....however, by the end of the day I was a wrinkled mess.","I was actually wrinkled by the time I arrived at my office in the morning from my seat belt and sitting in the car.","If you dont have to sit a lot, this maybe a good fit."
"4.0","This fit fine, although the sleeves were a bit long on a short person; nothing unexpected.","The style, however, is just a little too dissonant.","Although the one-shoulder asymmetrical cut flirts with modernity, the buttons on the shoulder and the somewhat flouncy fabric used for the asymmetrical ruffle make it awkwardly precious.","As my husband said: You look like a high-fashion Raggedy Ann.","Thats about right."
"4.0","I think this dress is chic and adorable, but not.","on.","me.","IMO, the dress would look best on taller girls with more broad shoulders that can carry the neckline of this dress (kind of like the model).","I have small shoulders and a bum and this dress made my shoulders look smaller and my bum look larger.","Returned without wearing."
"4.0","I wanted to wear this dress for a wedding held at an art gallery - as the bold print seemed very fitting.","Unfortunately, the dress was WAY too short.","And I am 5 ft nothing.","It fit tight in the bottom portion and very loose up top.","The shoulders fell off and the bottom rode up - so much so, I lifted my arms and my cheeks came right out!","Definitely not a dress for dancing in and the fit was definitely just off.","Needless to say, I did not wear this to the wedding."
"4.0","Fit was not as expected.","V was much higher up on my chest than pictured and the overall fit of the top was baggy.","Material wasnt as vibrate as the photos show and felt pretty itchy.","I ended up sending this back in hopes of finding another dress for a black tie wedding I am attending in April."
"4.0","I picked size 6 and 8 for the dress but in reality could have used a size 10 but it wasnt available.","My husband loved the dress so much that I winged it and wore the 8.","I did feel a bit uncomfortable in it because it seemed to accentuate my curves and not in a good way.","I felt I had to suck in my belly the whole time and basically spent most of the time using my hands to cover my belly area.","But overall, it is a great dress and so many complemented me on it.","I wont be renting this again but will look for more body appropriate dresses for next time."
"4.0","Got this for a wedding..","I am a thick women with big boobs.. Like I have to get a 16 for my boobs but a 14 for my body.","Dess wasnt attractive.","Probably would look better on someone sz 12 and under"
"4.0","ordered this as my first choice but instead wore my backup.","fabric and fit just looked a little cheap."
"4.0","I rented this for a charity event and was excited after seeing all the other customer photos.","It looked darling in the pictures, but I was so disappointed when I tried it on.","It just looked kind of frumpy, but what was really annoying was the designers name was printed in different places on the dress.","Personally I just dont understand why anyone over the age of 19 would want to wear a dress with the label printed all over.","Seems to kind of cheapen it a bit.","This just didnt work for me."
"4.0","The top was way too constricting for a girl with a large chest.","I am a 36D and this was just such an awkward fit up top.","Not to mention that the fabric gives no stretch so cannot lift your arms while wearing.","Its a pretty shirt, and beautiful fabric but just not for me.","I wasnt able to wear.","If you have boobs, dont wear."
"4.0","gorgeous dress but runs big - definitely size down."
"4.0","This would be great if I was pregnant but it was just huge."
"4.0","I wanted to love this/like this so bad.","However, it wrinkled so easily that it seemed un-wearable.","Bottom line for me the quality was lacking big time.","My biggest beef with clothes these days.","The other thing that potential renters should be aware of is height.","Im 53 and I think this would look better on the taller gals.","For me this was a miss."
"4.0","I did not find the dress did anything for me.","I decided on something that I had to wear for the occasion and did not wear the dress"
"4.0","I tried this dress on (and the back up size) ... the 6 was too small, the 8fit but very unflattering on me.","I did not wear it or the back up"
"4.0","The sleeves were too tight and it just made me feel a bit matronly.","My husband was not a fan of the dress."
"4.0","I like this dress on other people, but not on me.","Runs large, so was too large for me, and the color is so viabrant and buzy that being a blonde I got upstaged by the dress.","A brunette can def pull this off."
"4.0","This dress ran the largest of any dress I have ever seen.","I ordered the medium, my standard size.","I am a very standard size 6 in dresses (size small / 4 in tops, 6 in pants).","However, this dress was all around HUGE.","The sleeves were too long, the dress was way too big, it was unwearable.","Very weird, because DVF sizes small!"
"4.0","I couldnt get it to zip up.","I have a broader back and shoulders, and so the top would zip up all the way, and it sat weird around my hips and crotch.","I just dont think Im suited for jumpers, as cute as they are and as much as I want them to look good on me!"
"4.0","The colors of this dress are even prettier in person.","Unfortunately for me, the dress was way too tight in the hips for me and the straps were too long to fit.","I wished it had fit but if youve got an hour glass figure this dress might not be for you."
"4.0","I was really excited about this dress.","The pattern and leather is really unique and is well made.","Unfortunately, it was way too small for me.","I could zip it up to about my chest and then no higher.","I would recommend going up 1 (possibly 2 sizes) in this dress."
"4.0","If you have athletic arms, size up one.","The sweather fit, but for binding on my upper arm."
"4.0","Its a little heavy in fabric and it is extremely short!"
"4.0","I rented this dress to wear to a New Years Eve party but ended up exchanging it for another.","Besides being too tight around the hips, the top is see-through, so there is no way to wear it as its shown in the picture--even with pasties.","Youd have to wear a camisole unless you want to give other party guests a bit of a show!","I actually liked the silhouette; if the top of the dress had worked, I would have just sized up, but that was not possible."
"4.0","The fit of this is just too full and did not even look like a dress on me.","It made me feel like I cut a hole in a piece of red fabric and put it over my head.","Just wasnt for me."
"4.0","Im 510 and a size 10-12.","I ordered the 12 because sometimes Nicole Miller runs small.","It fit perfect but I sent it back because my husband and daughter both said it wasnt very flattering on me."
"4.0","The arms are just ridiculously small.","I usually wear a size 6 and ordered an 8 & 10 because I was worried about the arms.","They were so small I went with the 10.","This meant the rest of the dress didnt fit well.","I was self-conscious about the unflattering fit all night.","The two dresses I received were also clearly different shades of blue.","I received lots of compliments on the dress, but not feeling confident in it really ruined the dress for me."
"4.0","Im in between a 2 and 4 but wore a 2 because the 4 was not available.","I was small but material is stretchy; however I had to have help zipping it because of the thick material and hidden zipper.","I have a long torso and the jumper part was tight in between my legs and uncomfortable to sit down."
"4.0","Dress was beautiful and I was looking forward to wearing it but it didnt fit.","It was too tight in the waist and way too long from the waist to the shoulders.","Considering I had tried on at least 20 dresses at Macys so I would have backup in case the rentals didnt fit and very few of them fit, I was not surprised this didnt fit."
"4.0","After going over the reviews I thought this dress was two pieces and more loose fitting.","It is actually quite form fitting and I did not feel it was flattering at all.","I chose to not wear it.","Disappointing"
"4.0","I had to order up to fit my hips and then the whole thing just fit like a bag.","I should have known, but I wanted it to work!"
"4.0","This dress would be incredible on someone with a longer torso.","On me, it bunched at the waist,  and the sides flapped open.","Very flattering silhouette, but unfortunately,  it didnt work for me."
"4.0","I am 54 and didnt like the way this looked.","The waist is very fitted whether it was at the smallest part of my rib cage or waist, it was a tight zip.","Once it was zipped, the top was very blousy and skirt was a bit long.","The bubble on the top coupled with the longer skirt just didnt seem to hit me in the right place.","The fabric and print are great.","Just wish it had fit a little differently."
"4.0","I thought I would give this dress a chance, even though other reviewers said it made their hips look weird.","The other reviews are right.","It made me look like I had 2 sets of hips, since it was tight at my waist and my hips, and then flared out a few inches below my actual hips.","The small fit me fine, and I could have worn it if I was desperate, but fortunately RTR sent me a backup dress that worked a lot better.","I think if you are tall (5-9+) and straight (small chest and no hips), this dress may be flattering."
"4.0","it is more of a peplum top than I expected.","It made my hips look huge."
"4.0","Returned it because the dress was super thick and big on top.","No way I could have worn it out!","Super cute though"
"4.0","Didnt get to wear this because the size XS felt more like a M. Not a slim fit.","Also, be prepared for the discomfort of those sequins rubbing up against your skin and arms."
"4.0","Looked a bit edward scissor hands esque :("
"4.0","Pretty dress, but it was too blousy in the stomach area...the beading made it not as form fitting as I would have liked.","I normally wear a 4 and because I am pregnant, I ordered a 4 and a 6.","The 4 fit fine, which at 5 months pregnant indicated to me that the dress runs small.","I ended up returning it and not wearing it."
"4.0","Yeah the sleeves where huge and ran closer to my wrist than shoulders."
"4.0","Dress length is MUCH shorter than displayed on model.","It ended right at the bottom of my rear-end.","This looked more like a lingerie robe than a knee length dress.","It was inappropriate to wear anywhere."
"4.0","I really wanted to love it, but just didnt.","My husband kind of made a funny face when he saw me too (hes an honest guy and he loved the replacement dress).","It did nothing for me, but sparkle.","Did nothing for my chest, butt, hips.","The length was boring considering the lack of fit.","If you really dont want something form fitting and REALLY sparkly, maybe it will work for you."
"4.0","This was tighter in the arms and shoulders than I wanted, and also slimmer through the body than I was comfortable wearing.","Its a beautiful dress, but does not give much, so do order a size up from your normal one, just in case."
"4.0","RAN SMALL"
"4.0","Was not able to wear this top because the under tank portion was way too narrow!"
"4.0","Tight on arms, ended up not wearing just didnt look right !"
"4.0","Im very petite and without a waistline, this dress balloons around me, adding 10 lbs.","and it totally dwarfs me.","It isnt flattering."
"4.0","This dress was actually so short I couldnt wear it -- it looked more like a tunic than a dress!","Shame as the top half was super cute (maybe it shrank?","), I just wish it went down a few more inches"
"4.0","This is a really cute dress however it runs very large.","I got a 48 and normally wear a size 10/12.","In this dress I was easily 3 sizes too big, so I suppose Im probably more of a 40/42 in this size.","For reference Im a perfect L in Tory Burch."
"4.0","doesnt look anywhere near as nice as in the photos."
"4.0","The M fit like an XS and I couldnt even zip it up.","Im only 52 and it was so incredibly short, even if I was able to zip it up I would not have felt comfortable wearing it.","The dress itself was pretty and would have been cute in the right size."
"4.0","I was a little disappointed with this item...","I felt that the material had a cheap feel to it."
"4.0","It ran small on me and the puffy shoulders made it look like its for a 12 year old.","Very soft though.","I did not wear it."
"4.0","I couldnt get it zipper up and there wasnt enough room through the shoulders to fit properly, while the rest of the dress was great."
"4.0","This dress seemed sized appropriate, but all the material around the middle was just too much, and completely not flattering.","I tried it with a thick belt even, but it kept spilling out over the top.","I ended up not wearing it and was disappointed because I like the sequins."
"4.0","Runs small"
"4.0","I am a true 10, literally almost everything in my closet is a 10, however my bust is a 34DD, I suppose thats why it ran a bit small for me???","But I only have a problem with the length, everything else fits like a glove.","But it was ankle length and the arms were almost three quarter!!!","My event is tomorrow and I just wasted my non-refundable $150.00 on a short dress that I didnt wear!!","Dont think Ill ever rent from here again."
"4.0","This dress was actually overnighted to me due to a mishap with my original order.","Its a super cute dress, but not the easiest to get on.","I wonder if renters are even receiving the same dress, because there were no zippers on the dress I received.","I had to pull it on over my head, and I have a larger bust (34D) so getting it on over the girls was a task!!","Once I had it on, it fit well.. it was a little snug in the shoulder area..","I had to do some crazy maneuvering to get everything situated the way I wanted.","I am not a large girl, so I was completely taken aback by the fit of this dress.","I ended up not even wearing it."
"4.0","This was just eh.","I didnt end up wearing it.","It arrived on a Friday, I returned it that Sunday..."
"4.0","pretty dress and pretty fabric, it just didnt work on me.","i didnt wear it."
"4.0","The dress itself has tons of stretch, but the bust has a rather stiff, built in corset that was too small for my girls.","I could zip it all the way up right until I got to my breast line.","Small to Average size bust?","Plenty of curves?","This would look smashing on you."
"4.0","chest is quite large and low, soft feel but deep neckline"
"4.0","This was my backup dress, but I did not wear it.","The color is absolutely gorgeous.","Its true to size, but it was VERY short on me.","I looked at the pictures and it looked way longer on other people, not sure why?"
"4.0","Slightly short.","Not ideal!"
"4.0","Very cute flattering pattern, slits on the sides are placed a little high (difficult to wear a normal bra with this dress as you can see it through the slits on the sides), the top and mid sections of the dress feel like a true Medium, but the bottom portion of the dress is very tight!","It was difficult to walk around, and almost impossible to sit down in!"
"4.0","Cons: It just did not work for my body type i have slight broad shoulders and i felt like i was football player with the capped sleeves.","I just didnt feel flattered in the dress at all and i just didnt end up wearing the dress that night.","Pros: it was a very pretty dress and i really did love it when i saw it on rent the runway, but just not for me."
"4.0","i rented this dress kind of last minute.","it was only $50 and i figured if i didnt go to the event, id have a dress to wear out somewhere else.","we did end up going to the event.","i paired it with the gray schutz kija fringe heels.","they looked great together.","i am 117 lbs and 58 with 34DD.","i wore this dress in hopes that the top piece totally unzipped (because Im a breastfeeding mom)…well it didnt.","the dress was INSANELY tight and i was constantly trying to pull it down and out.","as a mom that had 3 kids in 13 months, it was a little too tight for me and not flattering.","i rented the small and medium (i am always a small) … thank goodness i had the medium because i needed it!","honestly, a large wouldve been best."
"4.0","Unfortunately, this item did not arrive in time to wear to my event.","I did try it on.","I found it to be tight around the rib cage.","It was also very unflattering no my post-baby belly.","I felt it made me look pregnant."
"4.0","This one is tricky for a lot of body types.","The dress is a bit long for short women (hits below the knee), and the midsection shows off any lumps or bumps - very difficult unless you have a very tight core.","The high neck is also a little unflattering for larger busts.","So far, my least favorite rental (I only ended up wearing it because I didnt pack enough other options for my business trip)."
"4.0","I ended up not wearing this one but thought I would give feedback as I did try it on.","The overall fit was good but it I thought it might hide a little tummy (I wear a size 28 or 29 jean and Medium tops and usually a 6 in dresses) but it made me look about 4 months pregnant.","I wear other dresses styled like this but I think because of the front pleats on the waist it highlighted the area I was trying to play down.","The color was nice."
"4.0","Thank goodness I rented a second style!","While this dress fit well and was try to size in the bodice, the length was extremely long!","I am 53 and even with 5 inch heels, the dress was still 2 inches too long.","I would have been tripping on it all night.","Additionally, both my fiance and my mom said it looked like I was wearing a bikini underneath the dress.","Indeed, it does appear that you are wearing a two-piece bathing suit, as the fabric gathers in odd spots and with the nude-colored slip under the fabric, it appears you are wearing a bathing suit.","The one nice thing about the dress is the neckline.","I loved the one shoulder look and the fabric was so delicate!","But it didnt make up for the extreme length of the dress or the odd fabric placement."
"4.0","This runs large.","I needed a 2, but opted for the 4 since the 2 was not available."
"4.0","Pros: lots of sparkle Cons: runs large, lots of extra material in stomach and hips areaUnfortunately, I wasnt able to wear this dress to Las Vegas.","I wanted to wear something sparkly and classy so I was excited when I came across this dress.","I read reviews that pinning the dress would help, but there was so much extra dress in certain areas that there would just be bunches of material here and there.","I think this dress would look fabulous on girls who arent petite."
"4.0","Dress runs VERY tight in the bust to ribcage area.","Material has to be steamed before wearing.","By the end of the night it was completely wrinkly again.","Looks so cute on the model - but a high maintenance dress in real life!","!"
"4.0","im 52 about 130 lbs.","the dress fit great around my butt and thighs but the chest was way to big.","I couldnt wear the dress because of that.","I wear around a large C/small D cup size and I was not filling out at all."
"4.0","Im very tough to fit with jumpsuits because Im very short waisted but have very long legs so, when I got this, I was really excited that it fit so well.. until I noticed the length.","Im 58 and the pants in the jumpsuit came to just above my ankles.","I felt like I was wearing floods without even any shoes on.","I tried the next size up and it was longer, but still just barely hit the floor without shoes on.","When I checked the size, it wasnt clear if maybe RTR sent me the regular instead of the long, but I didnt have time to replace it so I just sent it back and wore something I already had in my closet.","I was really disappointed that this didnt work out!"
"4.0","boxy and weird.","oversized in shoulders even though i have broad shoulders, and tight in chest.","not great for woman with curves."
"4.0","Couldnt zip the 12 (Im usually between a 10/12).","The ribcage and chest area is very small.","Definitely size up if youre busty or an apple."
"4.0","This was really large in the chest but fit every where else just fine.","It is just very average looking.","The other reviews were great so I ordered this with my unlimited.","I didnt wear it.","It did nothing for me and I found it to be kind of house coat ish."
"4.0","The unfortunate thing about the dress was that Im 56 and based on the other reviews, I got an 8R.","It was entirely too short.","I spent the night pulling the dress down and not standing up straight.","Also, right under the arms, the dress was a little restricting.","I still loved the look of the dress but feel like a long and maybe a size up would have helped with the issues I had."
"4.0","cute but felt a little tight and not soft, but still nice to have something different."
"4.0","This sweater is so big even for a 5 months pregnant lady.","Go at least one size down.","Pro: It looks good to scare people off on Halloween."
"4.0","I ordered this dress for my engagement party and ended up wearing the back up dress and loving it so much more.","It was really large up top and smaller on the bottom.","If It was mine and I could alter it, I would have loved it, but with such a large top it just was not flattering."
"4.0","I had a nuclear meltdown because the dress I ordered first didnt fit.","So, thanks to the amazing people at RTR, I was able to get this one overnighted to me at my hotel.","When I got it, I wasnt even worried about the sizes because it said it had stretch and that was a true statement.","However, I bodybuild (and Im currently trying to add muscle), so my upper body is wider than most and I had to end up wearing the 8, and even then I could not really move my arms and I ended up with marks.","The dress was loose everywhere else, but snug to the point of being extremely uncomfortable around my shoulders.","Next time Ill stick with my general rule of NO SLEEVES--EVER!"
"4.0","Im 51 and the fit was off.","Pretty dress, lightweight material but I think would be better suited for someone with a long torso."
"4.0","This jacket was well constructed but was just too large for a petite frame.","I believe had I ordered a smaller size the length would still have been too long for someone that is 52."
"4.0","Perhaps Im too old for this style, but it just didnt work.","Ive worn jumpsuits before but this one was kind of bunchy and awkward."
"4.0","I normally wear a size 4 and the small was too large in the upper chest area and waist.","The XS fit strange in that the top seemed to have extra fabric up causing it to gap open near the neckline/shoulders.","The cut-outs on the side were bigger than they appear in the picture as well.","The waist band did fit on the XS but caused the dress to bunch a bit.","The good news is that the color is really beautiful and I loved the length of the dress.","In the end I didnt end up wearing the dress."
"4.0","a bit too low cut and a bit snug for a medium.","usually her designs in medium fit me perfectly."
"4.0","The dress would have been perfect if the pockets werent there.","I dont see the purpose of the pockets as it doesnt add to the style or functionality of the dress, as women usually do not carry things around in the pockets of dresses.","I thought it took away from the dress by adding unflattering width to the hip area."
"4.0","I loved the fabric, color and the pattern.","However, I wasnt a fan of the way it was cut (or not cut) around the middle.","It gave me zero shape, but would be good as a maternity top, or if you wanted to go out for a big dinner!","haha"
"4.0","The sparkle of the dress was great, however the sequins are multi-colored which I wasnt expecting.","There are also MAJ shoulder pads in this dress, so it gives you a bit of the linebacker look, especially if you already have broad shoulders.","Its also a scoop neck which widens the neck line and extends the shoulders even more so.","I would definitely go a size down if you want a fitted look; the small was wide throughout the middle which caused some bagginess.","I am 5 ft 5 in and the dress came to mid knee cap.","The broad shoulders, baggy middle, and length weren’t appealing to me, so unfortunately I was unable to wear this dress."
"4.0","I rented this for a night in Vegas.","After reading all of the reviews I decided to go down one size so that the bust would hopefully fit better because everyone mentioned it was a bit large.","When I tried it on the waist was extremely tight even though I can often wear a size 6 and the top/breast area was still loose.","Over all a terrible fit."
"4.0","heavy, good quality material.","unique color and details.","good dress-four out of five stars"
"4.0","I didnt like this dress at all for my body type because I have curves and I love to show them off.","Whereas with this dress it made my butt look flat and it flattened my boobs!","I didnt even wear the dress I ended up wearing a totally different outfit, which was disappointing because I had my heart set on this one!"
"4.0","I rented this dress for a formal work function.","The dress itself was very pretty & would have been perfect had it not been too short on me.","If your looking for a fun, bright dress for a night out, this is it but I was just not comfortable wearing this at a 4200-person formal work event.","Also, the color itself was a bit darker than I expected - closer to a shamrock green rather than the sage green it looks like on the site, but still pretty & perfect for Spring!","Positive note - I contact the awesome stylists at RTR right away & they were able to get help me rent a new dress in 2 sizes & have it to me the next day (with only 1 day to spare until the event!).","Will definitely be reviewing the 2nd dress"
"4.0","the color is amazing.","Its bright and vibrant.","Gorgeous dress.","The big con for me is the length.","This dress was way too short for me.","I couldnt bend over at all without showing others my rear.","Too bad too because it was absolutely stunning."
"4.0","I just didnt really like it.","The arms were also really tight and i was self-conscious about the neck.","and overall meh rating."
"4.0","Im still nursing and the chest was way too tight.","Perfect everywhere else but i couldnt wear the dress.","I was to receive the 8 and the 10 but never received the 10.","The 10 may have worked but it would have been too big everywhere else."
"4.0","There was too much material for a woman my height to pull off.","Beautiful material though."
"4.0","I could see wearing this with leather leggings in the fall or winter, but its a really difficult match for summer or spring.","The fabric is much more purple/plum, with a metallic tapestry thing going on.","The fit was good, but I didnt like the look, so just returned it to RTR without wearing it."
"4.0","I rented this gown for a wedding of a coworker.The color of the gown is gorgeous and it really is green.I on;y received one size.The sleeves fit fine,but was too baggy in the waist for my taste and I couldnt belt it so I didnt wear it."
"4.0","Great color.","Great fit.","Unable to wear because it arrived with 1/2 of the hem undone (from the side seams all the way forward).","It looked like it had been pressed with the hem undone.","Also, there was indication of wear (material pilling) up along the back."
"4.0","It looks very cheap, the fur looks like its from hobby lobby.","Very cheap quality.","If youre looking for something nice dont rent this."
"4.0","NOT made for tall people - beware if youre 511 and above (Im 6) this is a SHIRT- I actually wore it as a shirt one night with white jeans and heels and it was pretty cute - but if youre tall and looking for a dress go elsewhere."
"4.0","Zipper was tough to use.","Ran small and not a lot of give with the fabric due to the sequin.","Went with my first look instead of this dress.","Im 56 and would have needed the long as it was short and showed my feet/ankles without shoes."
"4.0","This dress was a little shabby and a little short for a day time event.","Ended up returning."
"4.0","This dress runs one size larger than advertised.","WOuld have been a good work dress but didnt wear it b/c it was so large"
"4.0","this shirt arrived and had seen better days - it has obviously been well worn/laundered - it was grayish/yellowish in color.","I tried the shirt on and it was really awkward looking -"
"4.0","Good color, but not for apple shapes."
"4.0","Great dress.","Not ideal for hourglass or ample hips.","The pleating across the front is generous and makes that area appear larger.","I normally wear and 8 or a 10 and the 10 was quite large on me."
"4.0","This dress was pretty but it wasnt worth the pain.","Literally, the pain!","The sequins were so rough, I had what looked like cat scratches all over the inside of my arms by the end of the night.","In fact, I had to leave the party early because it was so bothersome!","If you have more solid arms like I do, I wouldnt recommend this dress."
"4.0","I thought this dress would be really cute, but it is not for petite women.","I am 5-2 and normally wear a size 2; I ordered a size 0 in this dress because of the flowy cut and gathers.","Even going one size down, it was still very large on me.","Because the length was long on me (below my knees), it made me look a bit frumpy.","The material has a very smooth cotton feel to it.","It would look much nicer on a taller person."
"4.0","Rented this as part of Unlimited and sent it back after trying it on.","This is not your typical fit and flare.","The sweater fabric is quite body hugging.","Runs quite small and looked a bit like a cheerleader / tennis dress.","It was even tight on my small chest.","Would look great on a very thin frame.","Or maybe sizing up would help."
"4.0","I ended up sending this back and not wearing.","This is super cute, but very odd in shape.","The top has no buttons or clasps, runs extremely large and boxy and the waist runs very small.","Seemed like it might be a defect, but reading other reviews, it appears to be a funky pattern altogether."
"4.0","I thought this was a modest v neck - its not.","It is Very low cut.","Not for me...."
"4.0","I didnt order this dress and the fit was kind of weird.","The front ruffle made it look a bit like a nursing shirt."
"4.0","A better description of this color is orange-red - certainly not the bright lipstick red as depicted in the picture.","I put it on and immediately asked my husband if I looked like I was wearing a prison jumpsuit.","I could have gotten over the color surprise (though Id chosen it with the hopes of wearing it for Christmas, so perhaps not), if the fit of the top had not been so loose and baggy.","A tank top would have provided modesty, but it was not a flattering look overall."
"4.0","This dress is pretty, but not right for me.","It is structured in the hip area, creating a larger appearance.","The 4 was too big for me.","I didnt wear this dress.","Im not sure the 2 wouldve fit right either."
"4.0","Nice color, but the fit is all wrong for anyone who generally wears a size small."
"4.0","The dress and fabric are awesome, but I couldnt wear it  because the neckline is way lower than the picture.","Im thinking the model is completely flat chested because Im not large-- b/c-- and there was WAY too much cleavage for a work event."
"4.0","I like to think Im in great shape - 3 days a week with my trainer, star in Golds Gym fitness videos, little fitness modeling - and even I was concerned about sucking it in.","Would definitely recommend spanx,  im sad I dont own a pair.","This dress hugs everything and shows every bone, roll, and line youve got.","Material is thick, I didnt notice any issues with it riding up, and was comfy to dance in.....","Even got low!","I wouldnt rent this designer/style again but only because Im wasnt crazy confident with my look in ithe dress."
"4.0","The shirt had a cute pattern but would just not work.","It wrapped around so you would want to wear a tank top under it.","I got a size too small and ended up not wearing it."
"4.0","I rented this to wear to birthday dinner, but returned it with the tags still attached.","I ordered a 10, my usual coat size.","I could tell the coat wasnt supposed to be fitted from the pictures, but this was so big I double checked the tab 6 times - I could fit at least one more me in it.","Also, it was gray not black (I assume I misread this in the description?).","Pros - nice weight, super soft material."
"4.0","This fit really nice and would have been so cute had they not forgotten to give me the gold belt!","Ended up not wearing it because I didnt have a belt it take its place, the belt makes the outfit."
"4.0","I am much more of an athletic figure - I am a competitive gymnast and not very busty, at all.","Although my measurements told me to opt for the 4, Im glad I took my alternate size as a 2.","The top was still ginormous on the 2 to the point my bra was completely showing in the front and I was giving everyone at the party a free show.","The waist, hips, etc.","fit properly though (was way too big on the 4), it was just the top of the dress that was out of proportion on the size 2."
"4.0","Dress had surprisingly short torso, very unflattering.","Might work better on shorter women.","Dress was not white, but a dingy cream.","Couldnt decide if it was the color of the dress or just discolored from use.","My first RTR failure."
"4.0","The dress was beautiful, but it gathered right at my stomach, and although I am very fit, it made me look like I had a belly."
"4.0","tried this on at the RTR flagship and it was not only ridiculously small (i wear a medium and couldnt even get it over my head/shoulders), but absolutely devoid of sparkle.","the sequins are *under* the stitching, but were not obvious.","very disappointed with this dress."
"4.0","Alot of sequins that was itchy under the arms..."
"4.0","This dress looked much better in the photo than in person, at least on me.","It was slightly loose and looked unflattering and dowdy."
"4.0","It ran incredibly large, was unflattering and the pants had such a wide leg it looked clownish."
"4.0","Fit so tight around shoulders arms...made it impossible to wear."
"4.0","It was nice enough I guess and a pretty color but looking at pictures from that day I really dont like it and looks a bit old lady-ish.","I really wish I had found another dress."
"4.0","Didnt wear.","Fit was fine, issue with the arms.","The arms were too small"
"4.0","The sleeves are quite long and bulky so it didnt work for me."
"4.0","Rented for a winter wedding.","I liked the material and lace detail at the neckline, however the dress was far too form-fitting on my very hourglass shape.","It really accentuates curves and Id imagine it would be great for exaggerating curves on a minimal-curves shape.","A note to curvy girls - it will definitely make your bum stand out, perhaps too much so for a formal affair."
"4.0","I shouldve read the reviews on this one more closely before renting.","Its quite heavy, to the point where its uncomfortable to move around in the dress.","The top was baggy on my frame, but Im small-chested and have narrow shoulders.","Im 53 and this dress fell at the floor, making it look formal and frumpy honestly.","I think if youre taller and going to a fall/winter event and want something covered up, this could work.","Just definitely not for me."
"4.0","I rented this dress for a weekend in Las Vegas.","My plan was to wear it to a show, however upon receiving the dress I immediately noticed the fabric was not suited for an April evening in Las Vegas.","The dress itself is gorgeous and I loved it when I tried it on…it is a little on the short side, but the conservative neckline makes is “okay” to show some leg.","I decided not wear it in Las Vegas, but I would suggest that a renter wear this for a winter occasion.","As I mentioned earlier, the fabric dictates a cold weather affair…it is very thick, no quite wool, but in that family of fabrics.","The dress itself is very heavy.","Overall, it is a great dress!","It fit true to size and I love the shoulder pads, I just happened to rent it in the wrong season."
"4.0","This dress just didnt fit my body type.","I have a bigger bottom half and thick thighs but also a smaller bust.","This dress was way too tight around the bottom and then felt a bit big on top.","Especially with the open back, it was just too big around the shoulders and bust area."
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing this outfit, but I luckily rented another dress with it in case.","I know jumpsuits dont normally fit me well.","I have longer legs than the average 53 person, and these fit pretty well everywhere except the bum.","It was a bit saggy and not as flattering as I wouldve wanted."
"4.0","This fit like a tent - wouldve been more flattering for a person with smaller breasts."
"4.0","Unfortunately, this dress was not flattering at all.","Im 53, wear a size 0, 110 lbs, and have an hour glass figure.","I think that maybe since Im on the shorter side the pleats around the left hip were not flattering and made my hips look much bigger than they are.","Although this dress is cute, I would not recommend it is you are petite and have hips and boobs.","Im sure that probably doesnt make a ton of sense haha but I know you girls are out there with that body type!"
"4.0","The dress midline hit me at an award place and really made my hips stand out in an unflattering way.","Also the inside material was thick and made it feel like an 80s prom dress."
"4.0","I felt this dress was a bit matronly up top.","It could be that it was a bit too large.","The lace seemed a bit tired, worn too much.","I didnt wear this to my event.","The color was good."
"4.0","I rented for casual wear but it runs small and was too bulky looking on me.","Its very nice quality but didnt suit me, I never wore it."
"4.0","These pants are super cute but run large.","I typically wear a 0-2 or a 25/26 in pants and these were too large for me to wear.","Tried to tie super tight, but definitely not able to wear as they were visibly much too large.","Size down!"
"4.0","VERY fitted dress.","More suitable for a club than for a business event or wedding."
"4.0","I loved this dress online but it didnt work for me.","Too large in bust (Im a 34B) and was too long (Im 52 and 103 lbs).","Cute, fun dress for a different body type!","Was grateful I chose to pick it up at SF Niemun Marcus because was able to choose another dress that fit."
"4.0","This was cute, but its not made for girls with a long torso (so I didnt get to wear it)."
"4.0","Although you cant tell in the photo, there are buttons at the bust.","There are only two, and they are placed to quite far apart, so if you have a larger chest there is an issue with the fabric gapping.","Im a 36D and if I wore this dress out I would have been giving a free show.","Its too bad because its super cute otherwise :("
"4.0","Way too bulky in the middle ....","I think even if I had gotten the small it would have been an awkward fit."
"4.0","As most people said, the scuba fabric was odd.","It was kind of itchy, but nothing a shirt underneath wouldnt fix.","I didnt end up wearing it because it just wasnt my style, and I couldnt figure out how to make it work for the winter.","I probably would have worn it during the spring, when it was more seasonally appropriate."
"4.0","It was too big.","It also has blue and green and red flecks, which are not visible in the picture."
"4.0","The dress was TOO form fitting.","It fit on the top, but was much too tight on my waist and thighs.","I am usually a size 6 or 8 and should have ordered a large in this dress."
"4.0","Very cute dress, but the proportions didnt quite fit my body right.","The waist of the dress ended up being lower than my waist making the dress look odd on me.","I ended up not being able to wear this dress, thought I would have loved to because it was so pretty!","Great fabric too!"
"4.0","So flattering.","An old dog could look good in this dress.","But I dont know how anyone can actually wear it.","The biggest issue is the straps, which are really weird.","They just kind of loop around your shoulders and into your armpit, theres nothing actually holding them up.","The second I slouched my shoulders or bent down to put on my shoes they were half way down my arms and the girls popped out.","Second issue is the the way the bodice is styled.","It hits the boobs in a weird spot so you have some quad-boob action.","I wasnt really sure what to do about it.","I coulda perked them up and over the trouble spot, but that was a little precarious, esp with the shoulder strap issue.","I figure the only way to really wear this dress is with a lot of tape.","I didnt have the guts."
"4.0","Unfortunately I could not wear this dress to the event I had in mind.","The color and lace detail were gorgeous - so  I was super disappointed I could not wear it:(  But, unless you are under 56 - you probably wont feel comfortable wearing this dress!","I am almost 59, and this was definitely not designed for tall girls and either size I ordered (M or L) was waaaaaaay too short to be appropriate in any event - especially a wedding."
"4.0","Could not decide what to wear to a black tie charity event, so I rented this dress plus two others.","I ended up going with one of the others.","Dress is cute, but it has extra fabric in the waist area is not flattering if you have anything to hide."
"4.0","Rented this dress for everyday/weekend wear.","Really wanted to like it, loved the color, but could not wear.","Like other reviewers, the slip fits true to size, but the silk overlay is SO SO big.","I thought they may have sent me the wrong size.","Unless a very oversized look is what youre looking for, I would advise against renting this dress."
"4.0","Really huge.","I am usually between a 2 and a 4, rented the 2 but would have needed a 00 for this to fit properly.","Wouldnt even stay up.","Also its much much longer than the picture - mid calf length which was very unflattering."
"4.0","The color and detail of this dress was beautiful, but because Im wider in the hips it didnt fit me right."
"4.0","Rented this for Vegas vacation, comfortable and pretty but felt kind of weird at the waist/hip"
"4.0","Its beautiful!","But size up!"
"4.0","Pretty color and nice fit.","The zipper is exposed underneath the keyhole cut out making it look as if the dress isnt zipped up all of the way.","A lady at the event I was at actually asked me if I needed help .",".",".","The arm details were not cute on me (although they look cute on others based on the photos).","I couldnt get the arms to lay flat."
"4.0","This dress was horrible.","I have  HUGE chest and it was too big on me.","My boobs were falling out of the material was either stretched or just didnt fit.","It was crazy.","I felt horrible the entire night.","I was so sad bc I really loved the look of it and was excited for the neckline.","Ill never rent this one again.","Womp Womp."
"4.0","The fit of the dress was poor.","Too long for a short girl.","The material was too thick and made it hard to move around.","Its really hot too so only rent in the winter.","A lot of a material for a small girl."
"4.0","this dress did not work at all.. i have proportionate shoulders and hips and there was not enough fabric up top.","it was weird bc the dress fit fine, zipped up, was not tight, but it was showing so much skin like between my armpit and chest that the dress looked so small up top, and made my hips look really big in comparison."
"4.0","Dress pattern was pretty but it was too long ( I am 54) to my knees and was too baggy around waist and back.","I did not wear and returned."
"4.0","There is no wiggle room in sizing due to the paneling.","The 2 was a little to big for me and it puffed out the hips awkwardly and made all the seams wavy.","The color is beautiful but wouldnt rent again, even in a smaller size."
"4.0","The top part of the dress fit just fine.","However, the slit on the lower part of the dress came up to an inch below my underwear.","When I sat down you could see my underwear.","I am a fit size 2 but I do have backside curves-- I would highly suggest steering clear of this dress if you have a booty.","Perhaps girls with flat backsides could get away wearing it.","Again, the top was fine."
"4.0","Not for curvy girls.","If I ordered a larger size to accommodate hips, the top would be huge."
"4.0","I rented this dress for a winter ballet performance.","If I had rented it for a longer affair (say a wedding), I wouldve returned it.","I was most worried about the arms fitting since I went with the size 10 (my shoulders are broad and my arms are not as proportionate with my waist size) but the sleeves fit beautifully.","When I first put the dress on, I was very pleased.","I thought it was so beautiful and very flattering.","However, I quickly realized that the inner lining was permanently twisted.","Its stitched in place and the seams do not line up.","You can make out the side seam of the inner lining on the left hand side of the picture above and you can tell it is obviously not in the right place.","In addition, the zipper in the back is incredibly crooked.","It started in the middle of my upper back and ended by my left hip.","There is no way the dress was designed this way.","I wanted to love this dress but the make of it just made it uncomfortable to wear."
"4.0","Itchy material ):"
"4.0","I ordered this dress for my bachelorette party in Miami.","It was a beautiful dress, but the seam at the bottom was torn.","I would have worked beautifuly if not for that.","It was also VERY short for my height.","I would have had to wear something to cover my booty."
"4.0","This dress fit very oddly; the top was very baggy on me.","The slit, which looks like its small, is actually quite large and exposed too much skin for my taste.","As a shorter person, the length was too long.","Overall just not a good style for me!","I think if you are tall and thin with a larger bust, this would look great on you."
"4.0","Now, Im a mother of 2, so my belly isnt as small as it used to be and my boobs may not be as perky as they once were.","That said, this gorgeous dress just did not fit.","I could zip it, but the waist seemed really high and was almost tucking under my ribs (clearly too tight), but the chest was so baggy!","I would have needed a serious alteration.","I think going up a size would have helped the waist but made the bust much worse.","Sadly, I couldnt wear it.","But the fabric and flow were divine, I was so sad to have to leave it behind."
"4.0","Pros: COMFY- like jeans and t shirt comfy!!!","Cons: Suoer short, didnt feel as short but when wearing it be very careful to NOT bend over AT ALL, not even a little bit!!!","Even sitting down and getting up was flirting with flashing.."
"4.0","Odd fit.. i felt like it made me look fat."
"4.0","I thought the dress was all black but it ended up being Navy and black.","The fabric was extremely clingy I ended up not wearing it at all"
"4.0","I would never wear this dress, ever.","I tried it on and my sister asked me to please, dont wear that.","The dress itself was pretty, but I think just overall Im not a fan of lace, and the neck was very high so I felt like a tablecloth.","This was sent to me as a back up  when the original dress I ordered from RTR wasnt available; so not my choice."
"4.0","I rented this as a backup dress.","I ended up basing the sizing and length off of other reviews, and since the 4L was the only one available, I went with that since Im usually between a 4 and 6.","The 4L was HUGE.","It felt like I was wearing a sack.","I definitely could have gone for a 2 or 0.","The material is also very heavy and very coarse.","I dont know if I would have worn this even if I had liked the fit.","The color is also less of a navy and more of a blackish blue.","It was nowhere near the dress I was expecting, and Im glad my first choice ended up working out."
"4.0","I unfortunately didnt wear it because it was just way too short, even though I was going to wear it with tights and boots (and I LOVE to wear short items!","), I just knew it would be too short and I would be uncomfortable!!","But Im tall so on a shorter person it would be fantastic!","!"
"4.0","This dress was probably lovely once, but the one I received was very worn.","The bow flops right over and the hem was falling.","It also runs very, very small.","I am 53 and 115 lbs and the size 2 was skin tight on me; you could see the indent of my belly button."
"4.0","Didnt get to wear this one due to size.","Definitely size down!"
"4.0","I was really excited about this dress, but once I tried it on, I became very let down.","It looks beautiful, and I love the colors and the cut looks amazing on the model, but it just didnt feel right and it wasnt comfortable at all.","Its huge on the top and extremely tight on the bottom.","I spent the entire day pulling it down and adjusting the back to keep it from falling off my shoulders.","I wasnt comfortable in this dress at all and couldnt wait to get home to take it off.","Its a shame because if it just fit better on top and wasnt so tight and didnt ride up all the time, I could have easily loved this dress."
"4.0","The shape of this dress doesnt work for me.","It is shapeless, and better for someone looking to hide a pregnancy or a bulge.","Not being facetious, but it is hard to find waist slimming dress on RTR."
"4.0","I am in the size 2-4 size in tops.","I went with the 4 and it was tight but the larger issue is that it was really short.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","I think because of the fabric and pockets on the dress it makes the fit awkward.","There isnt a lot of give to the fabric so it looks a bit off when you are wearing it.","Im not super hippy but this dress just didnt look good on me and was a bit tight in the hips.","Just didnt feel like I could move that well which wasnt an option as I was going to wear it to a wedding.","I love the colors of the dress but decided not to wear it."
"4.0","Ive been looking for a sweater-type skirt for work to counter the typical issues I have with a pencil skirt (riding up, twisting around, etc.).","This wasnt a good pick.","It had more of a going-out fit (skin tight from hips to where the ruffle starts), which knocked it off my wear-to-work list.","But it didnt even make the date night list because it looked totally comical when I walked.","The pleats are connected at the bottom so it just bulges awkwardly.","Go for it if thats your look, but I wouldnt recommend."
"4.0","true to size fit.","Im 58 and I could not have worn heels with this."
"4.0","I got this dress for a black tie gala.","The material was a bit flimsy and I didnt realize there was draping near the hips, which was unflattering on my body type.","The bottom of the dress felt like it was cut uneven.","Luckily, it arrived a day ahead of schedule and in enough time to call and exchange for another dress.","Fantastic customer service!"
"4.0","This dress was sent to me when the backup size I ordered for a different dress wasnt available.","The dress was funky - in a good way - the fabric feels like a scuba suit and the pattern was fun.","However, it was too long on my petite frame and hugged my non-existent curves in the wrong places.","If youre more shapely and/or on the taller side, this would work great for you."
"4.0","A very cool, fashion=forward top.","It didnt work for me because it was much more voluminous than it looks on the model.","Too much fabric."
"4.0","The dress arrived the day before I was flying to Mexico for my brothers wedding and I had no time to find another one or I would not have worn it.","Im a perfect size 6, but I ordered the backup dress in size 8 just in case.","Im glad I did, but the size 8 was still too tight, I needed a 10!","It was very unforgiving around my midsection so my tummy looked terrible, , it kept riding up my torso, my girls were really bunched up in there, and it was extremely low cut.","The criss-cross strips would not lay properly, so they looked askew all evening.","The wedding was extremely formal, and as the sister and only family member present for the groom I was in a lot of the professional pictures, which Im dreading to see.","The attached iphone shots shows how unflattering this dress was on me.","This was my second RtR dress and I wasnt very happy with either one."
"4.0","Too shapeless for my taste"
"4.0","The dress was a stunning color...and I loved the detailing on the back, but sadly I could not wear the dress.","Im a stiletto wearing girl.","I had on my highest heels, and it piled on the ground around my feet.","I felt like a little girl who had got in mommies closet.","I can usually pull off the longer dresses, but not this time.","Perfect for a woman 59 and in cat-walk heels."
"4.0","This dress just fits awkward-- baggy in some places, tight in others...it really is a strange fit"
"4.0","This dress runs small and if you have hips of any sort, this will not look good.","Im a 6, sometimes a 4, and this dress was tight and made me look much bigger than I am.","It accentuated all the parts you want to hide.","Made my bust look bigger, hips look bigger.","Overall I looked bigger and it was so unflattering that I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","Cute pants but ran big so I didnt wear them."
"4.0","I was very excited about this dress and couldnt wait to get it to wear for New Years Eve.","Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the fit.","The dress is VERY thick and short.","I am 58 and 145 and the size 8 wouldnt zip halfway up.","I generally wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but I had to go with the 10.","Unfortunately the 10 did not fit well at all.","It was extremely short and rode up, I had to continually pull it down all night - not the best for dancing.","Also, the seams in the stomach area hit at a weird spot giving a bulging affect when there wasnt bulge!","I almost didnt wear the dress at all, but it was so pretty and I didnt like any other options in my closet, so I wore it.","From an outsider perspective, you couldnt tell it was ill-fitting, so that was why I felt okay wearing it, but I felt uncomfortable the whole night and a little too scandalous.","I would say I generally dont have issues with dresses fitting well, so that is why I was a bit surprised this didnt work out as I had hoped - maybe just better suited for shorter ladies!","I do have a long torso and long legs, so maybe if you are tall go with a bigger size then you expect!"
"4.0","This was a nice dress, but it just didnt fit me well.","It seemed to bunch up in the front (right at the stomach) and didnt sit well on the waist.","Not sure what went wrong.","It just looked strange on my body type."
"4.0","I so wanted to love this dress.","The neckline is fantastic and I like the pattern on top.","However, the pattern accentuated my belly fat and made it stand out!","No thanks.","I did not wear this out to the wedding as planned.","Also my husband didnt like the dress, he didnt understand the mixed patterns, haha.","Thick fabric hid imperfections (except tummy) and my butt looked awesome in it.","Ive been looking at other dresses by this designer, hoping to find one thats better."
"4.0","its heavy and made my tummy looked more pooched.","Ended up not wearing it"
"4.0","Luckily I just ordered this dress as a backup.","One thing (this was minor) you cant see the cutouts when you have it on.","It makes the dress look very plain.","The cutouts were one of my favorite parts.","Two, (the reason it was unwearable) it zipped up the side, and where the fabrics changed, it left a big lump.","It looked very awkward.","The dress is supposed to look sleep, that lump really took away from it.","Im glad I ordered two dresses for my event."
"4.0","This dress was way too big for me.","The length was excellent.","If a 14 had been available, I would have tried that size."
"4.0","Didnt love the fabric on this dress as soon as I unwrapped it.","It also needed a great deal of steaming and ironing as it was packed in the box at got wrinkled.","The fit felt very small as I know I do not typically require a 14, and this one was snug.","Material does not give at all and I really would not suggest for anyone not built like the model, tall and thin.","Loved my backup Bagley Mischka Curves for Days dress.","Ah-mazing!"
"4.0","Was not flattering on my petite frame, lots of extra fabric that didnt hang well"
"4.0","Didnt wear.","Runs small in the chest, large in the hips.","the fabric is so thick it added about five pounds.","Looked matronly."
"4.0","Tighter fit.","It came to me knees and I am 58.","Was hoping it would be more youthful"
"4.0","Didnt end up wearing it because I had ordered 3 other dresses.","Really loved the color and the idea of the dress, but it was not a flattering or comfortable fit."
"4.0","I wore with a brown belt and brown boots to work to tone it down.","A little too formal for work."
"4.0","This dress was a little disappointing.","It wasnt the quality I expected.","I tried both sizes and relieved one did.","Looked okay, super short but since Im short...it wasnt obscene.","However...the issue I had was that the dry cleaning was unable to remove all of the perfume on that dress.","I was unable to get it out.","Even febreeze was unable to get the perfume out.","The replacement was not available in my size so I chose another dress.","Didnt end up wearing that dress either, I had to send it all back without wearing either choices."
"4.0","Unable to wear this.","Received size 4 (checked to ensure runs true to size) but there was NO WAY this wouldve zipped.","Sleeves were too tight on my biceps; waist sits high; bodice was very restrictive.","Love the dress but theres absolutely no give...wish I were able to get 2 sizes as part of the unlimited offering.","May try to get size 6."
"4.0","This dress was very tacky, I didnt like the sequins of the shape it gave me.","it was a back up dress and didnt wear it"
"4.0","This is a gorgeous dress, really nice material…however, although I normally wear a 6-8, the 8 was snug.","Note: I have an athletic, curvy build."
"4.0","Didnt end up wearing.","Material was much heavier and dress was much longer than I anticipated.","The neckline was also weird (on me).","Not my favorite dress Ive ever gotten from Rent the Runway.","Would not rent again."
"4.0","The sleeves are impossibly tight.","I almost didnt wear it to the wedding.","Going the size up meant that is was bigger everywhere else but unlike other comments, I didnt have any issue sitting.","Wasnt my most favorite dress."
"4.0","I honestly think it was my body type (Im thin, dont have too many curves) so it drowned me a bit.","I typically wear a size 4 dress and the reviews said it ran small so I ordered a 6 as well.","I definitely should have sized down.","Additionally, the zipper in the back made a weird bump on my butt.","Unfortunately did not wear it."
"4.0","Celebrated my 30th birthday in this hot little blue number!","I knew Id love the bold blue color, and it would be phenomenal in photos.","And it sure didnt disappoint!","The color - rich, the fabric - sturdy...no need to worry about VPL or finding the perfect bra.","My only hesitation throughout the night was more personal comfort level of length.","Im 58 and found the size 10 (the larger of the two sizes I ordered) to be barely skirting the line of being too short.","I knew Id be moving and dancing throughout the night, and though a size 12 would have given a bit more length, the overall fit would have been too large.","In most RTR dresses, I wear a 6 or 8 - but based on reviews by women with similar bust sizes...and, who are we kidding, also appeared to have a little junk In the trunk like me (thanks, ladies, for helping me out!",")...I ordered the 8 and 10.","Would I recommend this dress?","Absolutely.","Would I suggest considering the amount of movement your occasion calls for?","Most definitely.","It may have been a little short, but I kicked my 30s off on a pretty sexy note if I do say so myself!",": )"
"4.0","The dress is very boxy and runs large."
"4.0","Was a very tight fit (as others have mentioned)  and looked gorgeous on - BUT was still too long for short people and I decided to go with a shorter dress."
"4.0","This dress definitely runs large from the waist up.","Size 0 dresses are usually comfortably snug on me and this was large at the waist and especially in the chest.","Because it is a slightly heavier fabric (between the base dress and the floral overlay) it looks like it is hanging on you if it doesnt fit well.","Id advise ordering a size down if you are petite or have a smaller chest."
"4.0","Unique dress, nice material, and style.","But the fit just didnt work for me.","The sleeves were too long, the chest was too boxy, and the waist was too tight."
"4.0","This dress showed everything on my body, including the stuff I didnt like.","I have a pretty soft body so it showed every little roll.","Ha ha.","So I opted for another dress."
"4.0","the sequence was great and a lot of fun.","I loved the thick material for cold days.","I disliked the short torso, and frayed cotton sections on the sleve, around the waist and neck line.","it looked too worn."
"4.0","I wore my other dress because this one had no shape and was too long on me!","Im right between sizes so maybe the 6 would have been better!"
"4.0","First the stitching on the top makes it appear that one would be cold when in fact it is just the stitching.","I expected a bright yellow that would be more flattering on a blonde; while bright it had more of a pastel tint, difficult to explain.","It was also too long for my height.","It was worth a shot but didnt wear.","Not a bad dress, just not for me."
"4.0","I am a 38DD, this did not work with the girls."
"4.0","First,the good: the print was gorgeous (though its black, not navy).","The box pleating was neat.","Okay, the bad: the fabric of this dress was so thick, stiff, and heavy - like a blackout drape.","Definitely not appropriate for a nice spring day as I had planned!","And because of the thick, stiff fabric, its quite tent-like.","Ive had an Unlimited membership for nearly 4 months, and this is the first rental Ive sent back immediately without wearing - it was that unflattering."
"4.0","the dress was cute, but not as cute as in the picture and much shorter than expected."
"4.0","I ordered the 18W based on the size chart plus a 20W as backup.","The 18W was HUGE!","I could not wear.","Plus I should mention the dress is very heavy weight was between the lace and the lining.","I would not order this again."
"4.0","Better for bustier girls.","Fit loosely around the chest area and therefore was unflattering.","I didnt love (ended up wearing another dress) and would not order again."
"4.0","kind of tight in arms, very short and much bulkier and warmer than i thought it would be- returned it without wearing it"
"4.0","I really really wanted this dress to work.","The pattern and coloring is so unique and the material very light and summer friendly.","I am 53 130lbs, I have a spoon shape (carry the majority of my weight around my hips, belly; I am very small around right below my bust but am a 34D)  I had no problem fitting into the 6 around my hips, but I was swimming in the top/shoulders.","The dress simply did not fit my body type correctly."
"4.0","I did NOT end up wearing this dress because the neckline looked very odd.","It might work better for a flatter chested woman"
"4.0","Not flattering for an hourglass shape and the neckline was deeper than it looks in the photograph."
"4.0","First time using RTR and while this dress didnt work out because of a zipper issue and my backup dress didnt work out either, they sent me another two styles and thankfully one of them worked well.","Will definitely rent from RTR again and recommend it to anyone and everyone."
"4.0","The dress was much longer than it looks on the model.","I am 56 and it fell all the way to my knee.","I even tried the smaller size and it did the same.","The straps were also too big so I had to be conscious of my top all evening."
"4.0","I ended up not wearing this dress because it was very unflatering on my stomach .I loved the dress but I would not recommend it for anyone who considers their stomach a problem area.","I ended up wearing another dress."
"4.0","I typically wear a size 2 and so I ordered a size small.","This dress was far too tight for me to wear to work."
"4.0","The dress didnt go well with my body type.","I am short and the unique middle was too close together on my short torso.","The cutouts werent separated enough on my body.","It just didnt look great.","I did really like the thick material.","Unfortunately, it didnt work for me, so I returned the dress the same day it arrived."
"4.0","fit well"
"4.0","I wore this to my bridal shower this past weekend.","I typically wear either a 6 or an 8 depending on the cut but was surprised by how lose and sack-like the size 6 was.","I belted the dress but even that was sort of awkward looking due to the excessive amount of fabric in the back of the dress.","I thought the dress was decent looking but was disappointed that it didnt have a true wow-factor.","For the $75 rental price, I think I got my moneys worth but in no way did this feel like a $300+ dress.","Perhaps be the dress has clearly been rented many times.","It has the feel of a dress youve worn one too many times."
"4.0","The fabric didnt breathe at all so it was a little too warm walking around NOLA in it.","the shoulders needed constant adjusting so it was a hassle to wear.","It was really big and long, almost long enough to pass as a dress.","The sleeves were a little long on me as well.","It wasnt nearly as comfortable as I thought it would be.","I would pick something else."
"4.0","the dress was comfortable, and the color was great - but in the end , I wore a dress I owned"
"4.0","Beautiful dress and awesome fabric.","I wanted it to work but it was super tight for a size 6."
"4.0","I couldnt wear it, its possible that I needed to size down, but the crotch of the outfit was way too low, it looked ridiculous, which is a shame because the top half looked great."
"4.0","True to size"
"4.0","I couldnt wear it as it was very unflattering on me.","I got a small (my regular size) and perhaps I should have gone a size down."
"4.0","Im just about 6 feet tall so the waistline of this dress hit me in the wrong place.","I just didnt feel very attractive in it.","But not a problem with length and its a classy choice.","I suggest getting the necklace, too!"
"4.0","I had to exchange this dress last minute because it was too short.","I ordered the regular because my heals were only 2; and before I even put the shoes on, the dress was up to my ankles.","Loved the rose gold color though."
"4.0","Cute fit, but I found the fabric itchy and restrictive, so I did not wear it"
"4.0","This dress wrinkles easily, is very loose fitting as I expected it to be somewhat but had no shape and I didnt wear it because I was uncomfortable with how thin and see through the material appears."
"4.0","Rented this dress but I didnt wear it!","It was short!!","Long wasnt available and I am 58"
"4.0","The only issues I had with this dress is that it was very heavy and hard for me to raise my arms.","Also, the front of the bottom did not reach the floor (so make sure you have cute heels!)","and there was a train which was kind of hard to maneuver with on the dance floor.","Great material and quality though!"
"4.0","I was really nervous about getting this dress.","I wanted to rent it for a long time but the other renters pics and reviews gave me some mixed feelings.","I am relatively short and thin, so I was hoping to not have the same frustration with length that others had, but I didnt dance or walk around much at this wedding because the dress was just too short and tight around my legs.","The fabric was also a lot stretchier and cheap-feeling/looking than I expected.","I said this dress fits True to size, but in reality the bottom was too small and the top was too large.","I loved the back but was too cold all night to take my sweater off.","I did get lots of compliments though!"
"4.0","Pros: it looks great online.","Cons: the material is terribly hot, sweater like material.","The dress is extremely short and I spent the entire night tugging at it.","I couldnt enjoy dancing for fear that  it would rise too high and my tush would show.","Lastly, the material is really bulky.","In pics I look like I have extra layers of belly fat."
"4.0","I know a lot of other users said this but this dress really isnt big-boob friendly.","I went up a size and still had to go bra-less which wasnt going to work for a wedding (the event I originally ordered the dress for), but it was ok for the rehearsal dinner.","I kind of wish Id gone up another size though because the rest of the dress was beautiful.","I loved the pockets and the color."
"4.0","I am 59 and the long hit me ABOVE my ankles.","I couldnt wear it."
"4.0","The dress is beautiful.","When I first put it on, I was thrilled.","Yet, once I moved around, I discovered what others had written is true - the bodice/breast part is far too big.","I have larger breasts, a full 34C, and even in the size 2 I didnt fill out the top.","The only thing that worked is kind of clipping the back straps together more tightly to then tighten the top (thus changing the look of the back).","In the end I opted to not wear the dress.","Its a shame because the dress is truly gorgeous, classic and conservative with an edge."
"4.0","I rented this as an every day, casual dress, as I liked its neutral color and simplicity.","But, I am flat chested and wide hipped.","This dress clung to my hips, while the waist ballooned around me, making me look like a bottom-heavy sack of potatoes.",":)  Might be a better fit for a skinnier girl."
"4.0","Short"
"4.0","The fit is definitely on the smaller side.","Im an athletic build and it was quite tight in the arms but very flattering in the midsection.","It is borderline clingy so if you like to dance/have some room for food/drinks I would def go up a size or two.","I also prioritize my dresses based on comfort!","So keep that in mind.","It is very fashion forward and definitely a statement.","Wouldnt recommend unless you have somewhat tan skin as it is BRIGHT orange.","I mean think construction worker, airplane director, etc."
"4.0","Really small and tight.","Pattern is pretty, but could not wear."
"4.0","This dress is more low cut than the picture appears.","Very difficult dress for anyone with a larger chest, I ended up not wearing the dress because I did not like how low it was."
"4.0","The fit of the dress was beautiful and I loved the lace, but the tulle at the bottom was tattered and had many loose strings - I did not end up wearing it because it was not in good condition.","Otherwise the dress is stretchy and lightweight - very comfortable."
"4.0","This is a lovely dress--beautiful color, pattern, and fit.","However, it was so see through you could see even nude, seamless undies through it, so sadly it would not work for my event."
"4.0","This dress was almost too body-conscious for me.","I usually wear XS, but this ran on the small side in the waist because the side zipper bent and created a dip in my side.","I would recommend ordering a size up or at least getting this dress in black because you can see EVERY curve on the body."
"4.0","im typically btwn a 2 and a 4, have worn a 4 in this brand before, fit fine, but this dress is bizarre.","great pattern and color, but the 2 cargo-like pockets on the front didnt work with the overall style and the front had no snap button so youre completely exposed to your belly.","there is some overlap but if you lean forward, move a certain way etc, youre on display.","the top is also very large relative to the waist and im rather broad.","there is an inner clasp and 2 button snaps for the belt.","it was impossible for the inner clasp to stay on because it was set too loose for where the belt buttons snapped.","the placement of the clasp needs to be adjusted so there can be more overlap in the dress, which would help stop the accidental flashes.","the skirt has 2 slits, one on each side so the front of the dress can flap up, which is great if wind every hits you from behind."
"4.0","Should have went with a small.","Wasnt able to wear, the M was too big (Im 6-8)...sent it back for a S, hopefully the small will be a better fit."
"4.0","Its a very strechy fabric and the sequins make it really heavy so it pulls down a bit, you can go smaller.","Im typically a size 6, I wor the backup size 4, but really could have used a 2.","It was kinda frumpy, I was totally uncomfortable and I look huge in the pictures I have in it.","Because it was so heavy, I had to keep holding it up when I walked and eventually the sequins cut under my nails so I had to wear bandaids for a few days on a few of my fingers.","No kidding, dont be afraid to go smaller!"
"4.0","Trendy top, not super flattering."
"4.0","I rented this dress to wear for Easter, but it was far too big.","I am usually a 4, and I ordered a 4, but it was huge.","There is just too much material around the middle."
"4.0","The quality of this skirt is excellent, with a nice heavy fabric that would be great for cooler months.","However, it was SO SMALL.","I always wear an S in high-waisted midi skirts like this, but this one wouldnt even zip all the way up."
"4.0","The dress is gorgeous but the gathering in the front is unflattering.","I rented the dress but had to take a pass on it because the dress made me look full figured in the front middle."
"4.0","cute dress but extremely short  and I am 52"
"4.0","I am long waisted and was hoping the cut of this dress would give me more figure definition.","Instead I ended up looking like a pleated tube.","The dress runs long and the waist hits oddly high.","Shame because the pattern and construction were lovely."
"4.0","This dress ran a full two sizes two big.","I got the 16 because the 14 was unavailable, but a 12 would really have been needed to provide any shape like in the RTR photo.","Had it fit, it would be lovely.","Its actually a separate slip (black) and over-layer that is more of a knit.","And dont be afraid, the slip has some stretch to it.","Had it fit, this dress would have been so comfortable to wear, but it was unwearable and I wore my other rental option."
"4.0","The color was beautiful --- but when I put on the dress, it made my tummy look bigger than it actually was."
"4.0","I ended up not being able to wear this dress because it was too short.","I thought I would be fine with leggings but if I moved my arms upward the whole dress would rise above my butt.","I also thought it looked a bit less.....crisp than I expected.","This is the first time a RTR didnt go well for me, but I have rented a ton of times so I guess I was due!","I had a backup so all was well!"
"4.0","It was tight by my bust and loose by my stomach which I wish it was tight, made me look like i didnt have any shape at all!"
"4.0","Please see above, thank you.","I wish I had known to order two sizes up.","I normally wear an XS, and sometimes a S. I wonder if the M would have fit well."
"4.0","Too short and tight for me"
"4.0","I ended up not wearing this shirt.","Maybe if I had a bigger size.","I am a 34C and the shirt was kind of pulling around the chest.","The pictures dont really show how many buttons are truly on this shirt.","It was kind of a hassle to figure it out and in the end wasnt worth it."
"4.0"," The armholes were oddly cut for a larger busted person which might still fit odd if you had the perfect boobs for this dress."
"4.0","Not my favorite.","It is super short.","Im 54 and it was above my ankles.","Rent the Long one or find another dress.","There are better options on RTR."
"4.0","This dress fit me but the material has an odd texture and while it looked ok it did not look good/great.","It just wasnt flattering on me."
"4.0","Would be good on someone tall and slim.","Not great for anyone with a butt/thighs.","Super baggy around the waist but tight on butt/thighs."
"4.0","Before renting this dress, I read the reviews and saw that it ran short, so I ordered the long.","I didnt think it would be above my ankles!!","I am tall, but even going up a size would not have helped.","Beautiful dress, just very short."
"4.0","I had high hopes for this dress but it just did not work for me- the regular length would have been too short, I ordered a backup L which was fine length wise.","It was the top of the dress that was a bummer- the straps were too big and the lack of structure/ support in the bra area made me look very flat (Im a 34 C).","Possibly would have been better with some cutlets or something, but completely braless it was very unflattering on me.","Did not end up wearing the dress."
"4.0","I thought this would be a cool girl, edgy interview blazer but it was a little TOO hip and I ended up not wearing it.","I think this would be an awesome going-out blazer though."
"4.0","I rented this dress to wear for New Years Eve and loved the style, but it is very constricting and not made for someone with any shape whatsoever.","I am athletic with muscles in my arms and I could barely get the arms on.","It is a gorgeous dress, but you need to be pencil thin to wear it comfortably."
"4.0","I really wanted to love this, but unfortunately it was way too tight in the chest for me."
"4.0","RTR needs to get more dresses in taller sizes!"
"4.0","Good material, fit true to size.","I just found it didnt flatter the things it promised to."
"4.0","Didnt fit.","Runs small."
"4.0","I ordered a 4 and a 6 as a backup because of reading the reviews.","The 4 fit fine, but the sleeves were really tight and the 6 was really big overall.","The 4 hit a bit above the knee on me, which I like.","I also liked that it has pockets.","But because of the pockets I felt it made my hips look a little bigger.","Other reviews mentioned a frail lace but this was not my case.","However, nobody has mentioned the under-sheath being longer than the lace on the front part, at least on my two dresses, of by about half an inch.","I’m not sure if its because I am really short, or it could just be my body type that didnt work with it.","Overall, didn’t like it."
"4.0","I rented this dress along with the Vie La V Deco Dynamic Shift.","I normally wear a 6 (sometimes a 4) and rented the size 8 because many of the reviews said this dress ran small.","The dress fit with the exception of the sleeve length, which was too short.","I also found the dress to be very itchy."
"4.0","The front as awkward and very low for someone with a small chest.","If you have a bust probably a get dress for you.","Nice idea for a dress and quality of course."
"4.0","I returned this and didnt wear it.","It seemed worn and just didnt look right."
"4.0","I am a size 36 D and it was incredibly too tight in the chest, other than that it was beautiful.","The underneath layer (a red mini dress) rides up a lot, I taped it down.","I received a ton of compliments but I felt a little self conscious in it because it was so tight in the chest area."
"4.0","doesnt lay right if you have curves up top."
"4.0","Loved how the dress looks but it ran way small.....I couldnt even get it on.","It was my backup choice so I wasnt too upset that it didnt fit"
"4.0","The waist was much lower than my natural waist and the bust was much too large.","It looked like I was wearing a few sizes up, even though I had ordered an XS.","The material also felt a bit on the cheaper side, with the lace looking a little frayed at the bust.","Would be best for a taller and bustier lady!"
"4.0","Unfortunately the dress was too big.","This was luckily the back-up dress and I did not need.","You should note that the picture does not really show the detail at the waist which has an angle to it.","With my hourglass figure, it was not flattering."
"4.0","well made, not sure I like the rise in the back"
"4.0","This dress was very pretty, but just too big for my smaller frame.","The straps were insanely large, and the dress was too long and hit mid-shin.","It just doesnt work well with smaller frames.","I was lost in the dress and it just looked frumpy :( I sized up based on the reviews, but maybe should have kept my regular size, not sure if that would have helped."
"4.0","Unfortunately, had to return this without wearing it.","A few things I didnt see covered in other reviews caused my disappointment.","First, it is quite heavy, as it is covered in sequins, and doesnt have a slit in the leg to help make walking easier.","That was a concern.","Also, the fabric gathering in the front at waist is too much.","Would be perfect for a pregnant person or someone who wants to hide stomach.","Doesnt slim profile at all.","I didnt like the way it looked on me, so I returned it for credit.","Also, others said it runs large, but I dont agree.","Seems true to size."
"4.0","I wouldnt recommend wearing it to anything that you cant have a super short dress for.","Im only 54 and it was SUPER short on me"
"4.0","I didnt realize how low-cut this dress was.","I also didnt realize that it has the sides cut out of it.","I probably should have read the description better!","Pretty fabric but definitely something to rent for a SEXY and not a NORMAL night."
"4.0","way to short"
"4.0","this dress was an odd length and the zipper very flimsy.","I am typically a 6 in dresses, I ordered 3 others with this one and every other size 6 fit like a glove except this one.","I still loved the color so I tried the 8 and it still wouldnt zip.","The regular and long length also did not even come close to touching the floor.","Do not recommend!"
"4.0","This dress runs very large.","I am returning it within the 24 hours i have received it to receive a refund.","I have rented the runway before and have had my dress fit like a glove, so it was unfortunate to see that the 0 was too big for me."
"4.0","I was disappointed when I received this dress and was unable to wear it.","I usually wear a small and also got the medium, just in case.","The medium ended up fitting much better, but it was the wrong fit because this jumpsuit is made for women with longer torsos.","For me, it scrunched in the front and it was not flattering.","Also, the material is see through and the pockets show, which I do not appreciate.","Overall this was a big miss."
"4.0","Pros: Nice MaterialCons: This dress appears to have been washed too much.","The zipper was bunched up as if the material shrunk.","The armhole is ridiculously small.","It hurt all night and left a red mark.","The size is small on top but huge in the waist.","I found this dress to be horribly unflattering.","I am 56, 130lbs and wore a 2R.","I couldnt have done a bigger size because it was already big in the waist.","I kept my hands on my waist as much as possible to keep from looking like a box.","Overall: I felt really bad in this dress, but since I got it the day before, I didnt have time to run out and buy anything new."
"4.0","Absolutely beautiful dress but WAY too short.","When I tried it on it barely covered my behind.","I have long legs but still...wouldnt be able to lift my arms and bend or all."
"4.0","The dress came out of the bag and was underwhelming.","It definitely appears cheap in person, and the sleeves were all wrinkled causing them to fall oddly on my shoulders.","The fabric was thin, and the dress ran very small.","Color is true to pictures, however, I was not impressed with the overall quality."
"4.0","I wore this for a black-tie gala after seeing so many positive reviews, but was overall very disappointed.","Ive had far better RTR experiences, so maybe this was just an off experience.","The zipper was a tremendous struggle, as other women have noted.","Also, I am a 36C, and the cut on this gown smooshed my girls, giving me an unattractive uniboob look.","Other women looked statuesque and svelte, but this gown just made me look frumpy.","Also, I saw another woman with this exact same dress at my event, who was unfortunately standing two places behind me in line.","Pros: beautiful color, fabric has a gorgeous flow, elegant and classy styleCons: zipper is hard to manage, bodice doesnt fit well for larger busts, doesnt flatter fuller figures"
"4.0","I was so excited about this dress but it was too big for me on top, and under the full skirt was a not quite as full slip, and since it is slightly connected the to outer skirt the flaws couldnt be hidden.","I am definitely a pear shape so a different body type might work better."
"4.0","I was sent this dress as the second size in the one I was being sent wasnt available.","I am usually a four and this six was tiny!!","Even if I could fit into it, it wouldnt have been appropriate for the bridal luncheon I was attending.","The dress also seemed to hug and gap at all the wrong places.","I think this would work best on someone less curvy."
"4.0","This dress is not great for petite women!","Because the bottom is so full, it made me look even smaller.","I am a 34 DD and found the top to be tighter than most."
"4.0","Just keep in mind this runs a little large, I could have easily worn it to work, but wanted to trade it in for something a bit more exciting.","Its a nice dress, the fabric is a lot heavier than I was expecting, but it drapes nicely.","Probably better though for girls with flat chests, as it does have a bit of a tenting effect."
"4.0","This would have fit but I have a wider rib cage.","Absolutely beautiful and comfortable dress in person though!"
"4.0","I wanted so badly for this dress to work!","The print is adorable and the shape is great.","This dress runs so so small through the chest and shoulder area.","If you have a moderate to large bust or broad shoulders I recommend not ordering or ordering 2 sizes up.","I usually wear a 6 or an 8, 8 when I have to zip things over my boobs.","I ordered this in a 10 based on previous reviews and couldnt even zip it over my chest.","So disappointing :("
"4.0","As I am 5ft the neck is large, even for a full busted girl like me.","Also the lower half is too large and falls 2 inch below knee."
"4.0","I wear a 4/6, but this dress in M was cut so short through the torso I could not wear.","Waist came just below my bust line so it looked ridiculous.","Perhaps the last dry cleaning shrank it.","Ive noticed many of the RTR items are beginning to look pretty worn."
"4.0","The dress fit well and was extremely sparkly!","The main issue I had was that the sequins were sharp and ended up scratching my arms all up.","The straps were too thick and kept rolling in as well."
"4.0","i like the fabric and the color.","However, my bra kept showing through.","this is a top that needs fabric tape to stay in place."
"4.0","I loved this dress, but the sleeves were way too long!","Im used to having things be a little long on me since Im fairly petite and have short arms, but the bell sleeves almost entirely covered my hands.","It was a great fit everywhere else and I really liked the embroidery."
"4.0","It was WAY too short!","There was no way I cold have worn it.","I have no idea who could wear it.","Unbelievably inappropriately short."
"4.0","These are not meant for girls with hips/booty.","I could not wear them.","They are also kind of bizarrely cut and resemble some sort of an A-frame skort.","If you are determined to try them, definitely size up if you are at all curvaceous below the waist, b/c the fabric does not hang properly if they are at all tight.","I imagine these would be flattering on someone with a very straight figure."
"4.0","This dress fit sort of awkwardly, tight on the arms/chest but puffed out at the waist.","Colors a little more muted than in the pictures.","I wasnt blown away"
"4.0","I sized down based on previous reviews but still was not happy with the fit of this sweater - too bad because the pattern, zipper detail, and weight are great.","Much too big and boxy and made me look heavy.",": ("
"4.0","This dress was HUGE in the chest.","It was also really tight across the midsection.","I have a pretty flat stomach, so I think this would be a very hard dress to wear for most women."
"4.0","Loved the color of this dress and was super excited to wear it to a summer wedding.","However, when I tried on the dress, though it nipped and accentuated by waist, the skirt was cut straight  and I dont think it was forgiving with my hips.","If it were Aline, or there was even a slight bit of flare it would have been perfect!"
"4.0","It was the right size, but it was a bit too much material for me."
"4.0","Beautiful color and LOVED the lace...received so many compliments!"
"4.0","It looks super cute in the photo, but in person the waistline area is weird.","Theres a built in belt thats attached and doesnt secure well.","It was fitted in the waist for me... but fanned out in the stomach area (not a very attractive thing).","Thankfully, Im on unlimited and was able to ship it back same day."
"4.0","I didnt get to wear this dress when I rented it.","The material around the waistline made me look boxier than usual (and I have wide hips.)","The fabric and look of the dress was absolutely gorgeous.","I wish it would have fit me differently.","It was also a little too long for my taste.","Being 53 it fit me right above my knees."
"4.0","Runs large and pretty baggy."
"4.0","This is a nice dress if you have a very flat stomach and do not have curves.","Although I am petite and thin, this dress was not flattering for my curves and stomach."
"4.0","This felt short in the torso, but the pattern is so pretty.","I really wanted to love it, but couldnt.","I did wear it and the lining felt uncomfortable and shifted all around.","There are so many good rompers on RTR, so I would stick with those."
"4.0","this dress is adorable and well-made, but impossible for my shape.","I am petite, usually a size 2-4, and with moderate curves (mostly in the butt/hip region).","Im a little smaller on top, about a 0-2. this dress unfortunately had zero give, so while well fitting on top, completely squashed my lower half.","Not flattering I think unless you are very straight cut."
"4.0","This was such a bummer.","It bunches too much around the waist and under the bust, especially if you are wearing spanx.","If you are a straight and narrow body type, go for it."
"4.0","The fabric is pretty thick and I had too much room in my waist area, the dress made me look very big and bulky - which I do not need!",";)"
"4.0","Very pretty dress, but it was so tight I cant believe I got it on.","I am generally a size 6 and did get it on and zipped up, but it was very very tight around the hips, but baggy around the tummy/back area.","Im not sure if the dress was just worn, I had the wrong size, or if this is just how the dress is made."
"4.0","I am a redhead with pink undertones, this dress was NOT flattering on me, I chose not to wear it.","Better suited for ladies with a spray tan/dark skin."
"4.0","Beautiful color but i felt as if it ran small.","I tried on the biggest size of my choices and it didnt work out.","Lace doesnt give and that is that.","Called RTR and 2nd dress was a hit."
"4.0","The colors in the dress are really vibrant, but the skirt is really flared out.","Its just an extremely substantive/voluminous dress for how fun and almost casual it looks in the pictures.","I ended up not wearing it but maybe others will have better luck."
"4.0","I am a size 12 with a 38G sized chest.","I ordered XL and and the dress was still tight and my chest was popping out."
"4.0","I hated the fit of the dress.","Not only did it make my bust look huge, around the hips looked huge as well.","The length also was not flattering at all and I ended up temporarily hemming it.","The only thing I can say I liked was the color and the sequins.","The dress was also really heavy and seemed to have a lot of lining.","Overall I felt uncomfortable wearing it."
"4.0","The dress is cute, light and airy.","The bottom flows nicely and the length is good.","Unfortunately, the cut of this dress is off.","The sleeves fell about 3 inches above my wrist and the cuff is buttoned on too tight to try to wear as a 3/4 sleeve.","I usually wear a 12, but I could not zip up this one.","I would not try to wear this if you have long arms and full bust."
"4.0","This is a cute dress but simply not great for my body type.","It was very short and the cinching at the waist was not flattering.","I loved the color and pattern, and the dress was VERY comfortable.","I would suggest this for someone shorter as I think it would fit better."
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing the shirt because I wasnt prepared for how high the slit comes up - it definitely came up well above my belly button and even though the neckline is simple, I knew the slit would draw eyes down all evening.","It was also baggy on my chest and the armholes seemed large"
"4.0","I have broad shoulders and a wide rib cage and fairly thin and dont usually dont have a big problem with clothes.","This dress basically made me look like a linebacker dressed in (boring) drag.","If you are super narrow this might work."
"4.0","I read all the reviews and sized up, but should have gone up 2 sizes.","The medium was very tight in the torso and I felt insecure.","Loved the top and style, the fit just didnt work for me."
"4.0","I originally wore the 6 but the zipper broke on the way to the wedding so I had to go back and change into the 4.","The size 4 zipper was also finicky but at least it did not bust.","The dress is beautiful though but I would be concerned about the quality of the zipper."
"4.0","I am usually a medium up top, but I have more muscular arms.","This top did not fit them"
"4.0","Ordered a 6L, but this dress was WAY too short.","Im 56 and without heels it was barely ankle length."
"4.0","Despite the low rating I actually really liked this dress.","Especially for people with a skin tone that matches the cutouts I think its a perfect balance of classic and sexy as it looks like all the lace sections are see through.","The color was brighter than I would normally wear, but it was accurate to the pictures online and I didnt actually mind it.","I also loved the slit in the front and the length was perfect even for someone short like me (might actually be too short for most people used to wearing regular sizes).","Overall I felt great in the dress and loved the aesthetic, but I gave it a low score because everyone else seemed to hate it on me and I had to agree when I saw it photographed.","Im just going to attribute this to it not being compatible with my shape, but the overall comments from multiple people was that it made me look short, wide in the shoulders, and my boobs look saggy.","Perhaps this last one could be avoided with a special lifting stick on bra, I just didnt have one on hand."
"4.0","This dress is not very petite friendly.","The material and style are very nice, but the shoulder straps were too long and there was a lot of puffiness around the neck area.","The waist and the length were fine though so it may work better on someone with a longer torso/bigger bust."
"4.0","I loved the look of this dress online and was disappointed when I received it.","It looks very fitted at the waist and then loose around the hips--in reality the dress was very loose in the waist and made me look extremely wide.","I had about 6 inches of extra fabric and it was not remotely flattering.","It was also a bit long on me, at only 54.","Ive worn other Milly dresses in a size 2 and they usually fit quite well.","This one just totally missed the mark (I didnt wear it to the wedding).","The color was beautiful, however."
"4.0","Rented this as a back up for a Vegas Vow Renewal.","Based on reviews, I got a size up from what I normally wear.","I still couldnt even begin to zip it up.","It runs really small, especially for pear shapes, because it has a very slim skirt under all that netting.","Looks awesome in the photos though - wish it would have worked."
"4.0","This dress had thick stretchy material.","I liked it but I wasnt a fan of how the bust looked, and the peplum wasnt as nice as it looks in the picture.","It was sorta big and awkward.","Luckily this was my back up dress.","However, fit was perfect except the bust area."
"4.0","This is great dress made of great material.","The only problem is that it runs very large.","Always size down with this dress.","I could not wear it, but it is a very breathable and comfortable cotton fabric."
"4.0","i am pretty short - 52 - and even though this was a size zero, it was far too long/big for me to wear without looking ridiculous."
"4.0","It was way too long and bulky for me, unless I had super high heels, it didnt look right.","I wish it was few inches shorter, it would have been nice."
"4.0","I fell in love with the back of this dress.","It was so beautiful in the photos!!","The front however is not flattering on an hourglass figure.","I would also recommend going a size or two up in your backup dress."
"4.0","I am usually a size 2 or 4, so thats what I ordered in this dress and the size 2 was exceptionally large.","It fit me like a pillowcase with sleeves.","The color of the lace is gorgeous and the length was perfect but it made me look so shapeless I couldnt wait to take it off.","Thank goodness I ordered a backup dress!","!"
"4.0","This definitely isnt for anyone with a full C-D+ cup, especially if you are small in the waist and/or petite.","It made me look very wide in the torso & the sleeves dont allow for any arm movement without crushing my chest.","It would probably work best if youre built like the model in the picture."
"4.0","At 51 this dress was way too big and boxy for me.","I could tell that it would look cute on a taller person.","The print is fun.","Overall its very structured and almost kind of stiff and starchy.","I think thats how its supposed to be but it wasnt very comfortable."
"4.0","The fit is a bit awkward-felt a little short on me and I have a short torso"
"4.0","The overall fit was terrible.","I normally wear a 4 or 6, but mainly a 4.","I ordered a 4 in this dress but it wouldnt even zip up.","The arms or sleeves were unusually tight fitted and it prevented the dress from fitting at all.","I believe that a 6 or an 8 would fit better.","I couldnt believe that the size was such a difficult fit for me because I really love this dress."
"4.0","Didnt Fit"
"4.0","I had to send both sizes back because the lacey arms had no give what-so-ever.","Im a swimmer with big shoulders and I couldnt even get the arms all the way on.","The rest fit perfectly and was pretty cute, although the color is a little turquoisier than I expected."
"4.0","This dress is gorgeous and looks amazing on the model however I was disappointed to find that it looked baggy in a bad way on me.","I have a petite frame and this was just very unflattering.","I ended up wearing a different dress and wish there were reviews when I ordered this dress.","Would not recommend for small frames."
"4.0","The shirt shallowed me and was way too big for me to wear.","Go down a size when ordering.","It is a gorgeous color and great material."
"4.0","Didnt wear since it was too large and somewhat itchy from the fabric."
"4.0","Im usually a small or size 4 in items but the small in this jacket was too big for me"
"4.0","This dress runs small (above mid-thigh for women taller than 60) and is weirdly narrow at the bottom, which makes it difficult to walk in.","I didnt wear it."
"4.0","The fit was so awkward.","It also was heavy."
"4.0","Didnt fit.","The 2 was even way too big.","Im usually a 2-4 depending."
"4.0","Not a particularly memorable item.","Fit was a little weird.","Fabric wasnt particularly warm or soft.","Wore it once because I had it, but forgot it was in my closet for days."
"4.0","LOVED the style of this shirt.","It checked off all my boxes that I look for in clothes - flowy, can wear normal bra, not tight, stylish, etc.","Unfortunately, it was SUPER tight in the bust which caused the neck to look very ill fitting.","It fit nicely in all other places."
"4.0","Im 51, and this dress was awkwardly long on me.","It seems like there is just too much fabric in the skirt of the dress.","The size zero was perfect on my upper body, but it accented my hips and did not flatter my lower body at all.","I did not end up wearing this to the wedding."
"4.0","Hi Rent the Runaway Crew,Beautiful dress, but I couldnt wear that because the length was too long :(My height is 51.","Thanks."
"4.0","I am 52 and this dress was way too long for me.","In the photo, the dress just below her knees, but when I tried it on, it was just a few inches above my ANKLES.","Even with heels, it was entirely too long for me.","Shorter girls, be careful with this dress.","It also is a little big snug.","I usually wear size 2 in dresses but even when I tried on the backup size 4, it was still snug.","This dress was not good for me at all."
"4.0","This dress has pockets and made me look like I had a reverse muffin top.","The color is great."
"4.0","I couldnt even zipper the back, I would definitely have to size up to a 6"
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress, but I had a flashback of my mom wearing something similar in the early 90s.","Its a great dress, just a little mature for what I was looking for."
"4.0","This top was a disappointment.","The size that fit well at the waist, was too large in the chest.","It was also itchy, but cant be worn with a camisole due to the sheer shoulders and midriff.","I think it looks better in the photos than in person."
"4.0","I ordered this dress for an NYE event in Charleston.","I read the previous reviews about the long sizes being extremely long and girls having to hold it up all night- and after measuring my shoulder to floor length with the heels I was planning on wearing I should have been able to wear a regular size perfectly.","I ordered a 6R and 8R.","When the dress came in, it was a beautiful perfect red color but both sizes were way too short- even barefoot.","Definitely go with the long version if you are over 57.","I also didnt especially like the way the dress fit me.","I dont have many curves and am fairly thin but I feel like the dress made my shoulders look like a football players and the cinge in the middle made me look much bigger than I was.","I think this dress would look best on petite curvy women that already have more of a curve in their waste.","When I tried the size bigger on it just draped over me, making me a box.","I wish I would have gotten a picture in it, but ended up returning it the same day I received it and didnt even think about it!"
"4.0","I rented this dress for an end of summer wedding.","I absolutely loved how playful the print was and got a lot of compliments on it.","I was not crazy about the fit though.","As other reviewers have said, this dress is very low cut and large in the front.","You definitely need fashion tape to keep everything in place.","The back of the dress has the same cut as the front.","For me, I found this laid weird on my frame.","It gaped open and showed the back of my bra.","I had to put a tiny pin in the back to keep it from gaping out.","I probably would not rent this one again."
"4.0","If youre 57 or taller, this isnt a good choice.","I didnt end up wearing this one because it was too short in the stride and almost too short overall, even the Long.","Im only 57 and am short-waisted, so this was disappointing.","Otherwise, the color is really pretty.","Also extremely low cut, but there was a snap in place to keep the girls from completely hanging out."
"4.0","I knew better!","large oversized dresses dont fit me."
"4.0","The top was a little bit baggy but tight at the armpits and neck.","I chose not to wear it and it sent it back the same day and was given online credit."
"4.0","This was a backup dress for my friends engagement party.","Unfortunately, it was not very flattering and I opted not to wear it.","The dress has a lot of fabric and it does not give any definition to your waist.","The dress was more straight until the waistline where it flared out, I tried using a belt, but it just didnt work.","The model in the photo appears to have a much more defined shape in this dress, but that was not my experience at all.","This was my first RTR fail, but that wont keep me from renting again."
"4.0","Really cute, but not easy to wear day to day."
"4.0","I loved the fabric and quality.","The neckline is really great too.","I am very petite and should have known better and not ordered a pant jumpsuit.","Did not end up wearing it.","The leg has a zipper so it bunches weirdly if it is too long."
"4.0","I really really wish this dress didnt have the slits under the bust... they were way larger than appears on the model and I just wasnt comfortable showing that much skin.","I ended up going with my back up dress because I felt it was too revealing.","Otherwise would have been a fabulous dress."
"4.0","I am usually between a 2 and a 4, but I rented this dress in a 4 to make sure it wasnt too tight.","I could barely squeeze myself into the 4 and when I did, even though nothing was popping out, it felt too tight for a wedding."
"4.0","This dress was really disappointing.","I was looking forward to having a fun dress to wear to my birthday dinner, but was saddened the second I zipped this up.","The top runs a size too large, leaving gaps of loose fabric along the bust/arms.","Because of the cut of the back, I didnt wear a bra and with the gaps I was constantly fiddling with the top, scared I was flashing everyone in the restaurant.","The skirt portion is pretty and also fit a little large, but the sizing didnt make it look completely ill-fitting, just looser than expected...it ended up being the dress only good part.","The color and cut detail comes across as just meh in real life."
"4.0","Its a gorgeous piece, feels high quality, pretty design.","But the fit is really unforgiving if you have anything but an extremely flat stomach."
"4.0","Its shorter than it appears and run small.","I wasnt impressed and it was unflattering.","If I tried to take another shot at it I would have to order a size 8 or so because I am normally a size 2 in tops and the 4 was way too tiny!"
"4.0","This dress was so pretty in person but it was about 5 inches longer than what rtr reports it is.","I rented another dress that was in fact 58 inches long and this one was 4-5 inches longer.","It was also loose around the rib cage.","Other down side was about 15 girls had this dress on at the event."
"4.0","Wanted to wear this under a black jacket for a work event.","WAY too tight.","Order up."
"4.0","This is absolutely adorable, but with the length of my torso it simply didnt work for me.","Sad I wasnt able to wear this because I think it is a great outfit!"
"4.0","I rent from RTR frequently and in designer clothing I wear a 6.","This is sized more like an outfit from the Gap.","I needed a 4 or maybe even a 2.","But thats not why I didnt like it.","I didnt like it because its just too mom.","I was hoping that linen would be casual and perhaps beachy, but this is definitely a wear to work outfit.","Nothing special about it.","It is what it is."
"4.0","I ordered the medium and a small as my back up dress.","I ended up wearing the small.","On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 5.","The positive – it is very unique.","I also love the scuba material, but the pattern is not the most flattering.","Also, when sitting the dress bunched up at the waist and just looked bulky.","I was trying to smooth it out throughout the night, which made me uncomfortable.","The dress was tight around my chest and I couldn’t wait to take it off.","This isn’t my most favorite RTR dress; however, I don’t regret trying it!"
"4.0","I selected this as part of my unlimited order and I am glad I had others to pick from!","Ran very small and was a struggle even with the side zipper to get in!","Never wore it."
"4.0","The dress fit very comfortably.","I also liked the length - Im 57 and with a 8R I wore kitten heels so that you couldnt see my shoes.","I would have had to go with the L to wear heels."
"4.0","Great dress, nothing wrong with the dress.","It just didnt fit my short-torso body-shape.","Would be great on a longer torso."
"4.0","This is a stunning dress.","The draping is beautiful.","One caution: it is not really ok for larger busts.","If youre a D or bigger, you probably want to try it on in a store first, because theres a diagonal seam across the bust that, if it doesnt hit the right places, looks REALLY awkward.","I had to convert my bra into a medieval torture device so that it would approach fitting correctly (and Im a true Nordstrom fitting D so I know there are plenty of bigger ladies out there).","Its also not all that great if you have a long torso, because the draping wont hit you in the right places.","To sum up: beautiful, but find a store where you can try it on first.","I was really thankful I was in a dark room."
"4.0","way too big on me, i do have a small waist, but i wear a 25/26 in jeans so thought the 2 would fit but i was swimming in them.","definitely go a size down!"
"4.0","beautiful dress, loved the cut- just way too big in chest/ shoulders.","ran very large"
"4.0","This dress ran large and the material was very heavy.","It is not as flattering on as I had hoped."
"4.0","Too big and bulky and shorter than I expected."
"4.0","Pros - beautiful colorCons - not sure if it was stretched out, but it would not stay up - this dress runs large"
"4.0","I have a slim waste but definitely have some Italian curves.","I usually wear 2/4 in dress sizes but in the 4, the bottom hem of the dress was so tight that I couldnt end up wearing the dress but everywhere else fit perfectly.","I loved it and wish it would have worked out but because I could barely move I didnt end up wearing it."
"4.0","If you are curvy and have a booty but lack in the boob department, this dress fits a little funny.","The upper back was kind of sagging off of me and my chest looked completely flat but the rest of the dress fit tight and was flattering."
"4.0","This was a no for me.","The coat doesnt have any shape to it so it just seemed to swallow me.","Im shorter so it was way too long as well.","It was really a beautiful coat.","It was not heavy but the material is still enough to keep you warm.","This is a well made coat.","I think on the right person it works, just didnt work for me."
"4.0","The color is very pretty and the fabric is woven with gold sparkle.","However, this runs large and fits awkardly."
"6.0","I love the cut on this dress but the colors really washed me out.","I am fairly pale and I dont think the pastel/orange/black combo did me any favors.","Regardless, Milly knows how to fit a dress."
"6.0","I got this for a date but didnt get to wear it because of the unusual fit.","I have a torso in proportion to my height and a substantial sized bum and average width hips.","But this dress had tons of space in the hips and 500 tons of space in the bum and not only that but the bum area was unusually high for me.","And even though it is a bodycon style, it didnt conform to me.","I could have gotten away with the hip thing as the dress looked so very good from the front.","But from the side and back it just looked ridiculous.","I even tried to disguise the fit with different types of belts but nothing worked.","Other than this it is cute."
"6.0","Zipper was difficult to zip/unzip due to the crochet top.","Not really meant for busty girls, the neckline hit right on my collar bone, and the neck tie was meant more for design not support.","Beautifully designed dress, but not as supportive at the top  as I wouldve preferred.","Length was fine with heels"
"6.0","Rented this as an option.","The back was amazing but hit a little long and was a little too plain from the front for the event"
"6.0","It runs small in the top area of the dress.","I am bigger chested so I had to size up but unfortunately, that made the body of the dress way too big on me.","I still ended up wearing it because I didnt have anything else to wear and the wedding was black tie only.","It ended up being fine, but if you have a different body top on top than on your bottom (I have very small hips and legs), then it fits awkwardly."
"6.0","I received a lot of compliments on this dress.","The color is soft & perfect for an early evening or afternoon wedding.","I normally wear a size 2, but I had a size 4 sent as well.","There wasnt much difference in the two sizes so I ended up going with the size 2 even though I thought the 4 would fit better.","Its very tight thru the waist & hips & yet was loose on me in the top.","The lace is very elegant, but I noticed it looked a bit worn given that this dress has probably been worn many times.","The size 4 also had a pen mark on it so I couldnt really wear that one anyway.","I accessorized with a champagne colored pashmina, a gold purse, gold shoes, and some small diamond earrings."
"6.0","The dress was about 2.5 inches too long even though I was wearing 3 inch heels.","The fit of the waist and hips was great, I had slightly wider set hips and it still wasnt too tight.","The biggest problem for me was the top.","I dont have the biggest chest but Im at least average, and the top was way too large.","I couldnt turn or sit without exposing myself.","I ended up having to buy safety pins to hold it shut, but even the didnt work very well.","I still had to be careful the whole night not to bend over or move too quickly.","The dress was beautiful and people who didnt know about the safety pins loved it, but the stress and anxiety of having to pin it and be careful sort of ruined it for me."
"6.0","This dress runs large- I typically wear a 4, and chose to wear the 2 for the wedding.","The color and length are great, but the fit around the waist and lower back was off - the dress fit like a glove at the bust/shoulders and at the butt/thighs but was bunching and loose around the midsection - I found myself pulling it down at the hips throughout the evening."
"6.0","this was very cute and well made, but the length was so strange that it was partially a high-low dress, partially a ballgown on my frame.","it looked silly so I sent it back."
"6.0","This was a very cute skirt, but so very wrinkly!","!"
"6.0","Unfortunately I couldnt wear the dress.","The size two was swimming on me, and I believe a zero would have also been much too large.","It is quality material and looks very summery and bright.","Great pattern but not made for someone without curves to fill it out."
"6.0","This dress just made me feel bigger than what I am."
"6.0","The color was really bright- magnetta.","I liked it.","The material is thick.","The part that flares out kind of comes out.","Its a little poofy.","I paired this with neutral ankle length pants and cream pumps.","The top had pop and thats what I wanted.","It was very nice.","Not a huge hit but worked for what I needed it for (a professional-type event where I wanted to look professional but summery and not overly serious)."
"6.0","Was a little large, especially on top and in the waist.","Cute dress overall."
"6.0","Unfortunately, it was not made for me.","Im a short girl with some curves.","The ruching on this dress were terribly unflattering, as a large part of it hits at the waist, making my normally thin waist look quite large.","It was also uncomfortably tight around my neck.","I was expecting the fabric to be sleek and slinky, but it was more chiffon-like, which probably explains why the ruching was so bulky.","I was a fan of the color, but everything else about this dress just did not work."
"6.0","Loved this romper in the photo but it turns out it was made for someone with a slightly longer torso... the darts hit me about 2-3 inches below my bust, but the waist fit perfectly.","Unfortunately, I wasnt able to wear it but a friend of mine who was a bit taller did and she looked great!","I will also add that the fabric is deceivingly heavy/thick even though the lace makes the whole piece appear very light.","I was sweating!"
"6.0","This was a beautiful dress that did not quite work for my body type.","Although I am petite, I had broad shoulders and wider hips, and the dress made my proportions look a little off.","It is a little on the heavier side which may not be appropriate for a summer or warm weather.","Here is my take:ProsHigh quality fabric and gorgeous color (periwinkle overlay on top of grey jersey like material) which makes it look expensive.","The length is great for shorter women (53 and under) who want to show off their legs but is not too short.","Overall, a nice design!","ConsFor those who are conscious of their mid-section (as I am), this dress may not work for you.","It does seem to work for hourglass and straighter body types.","The slight shoulder pads made my shoulders look wider, which I did not want to accentuate."
"6.0","Pros: the dress is made with a heavy jersey-like fabric (though its a polyester blend I believe), so its very comfortable to wear.","Cons: the fabric was somewhat casual, so you be underdressed in it if you dont dress it up.","I added dangling gold earrings, a large gold cuff, and a gold and black clutch (and big natural curls!",")."
"6.0","I didnt have an issue with the rib area like other reviews and found it easy to zip up.","But I have broad shoulders which caused the sleeves to puff out giving it a boxy effect.","There also was a large hole in the side seem above the zipper."
"6.0","Wanted to love it, but this dress just ended up looking frumpy on someone my height, and flared out strangely at the hips.","It also seems to run a size small in the waist and ribcage.","Perhaps a better bet for someone a bit taller.."
"6.0","Loved the idea of this but was too short in the crotch area which made the top feel like it was coming down.","Otherwise love the look of this jumpsuit.","Perhaps a 2L would work better, even though I am only 56."
"6.0","I got this as a back up for a formal wedding in October but didnt end up wearing it.","The 8 was really big.","(Im usually a 6 but based on the reviews I thought I needed to size up.)","The cut of the dress at the waist also made it really unflattering.","The fabric was gorgeous though!"
"6.0","Dress arrived in great condition, looked lovely and very classy for a bachelorette party!","Only downside: SIZE DOWN, ladies!!!","My usual 8 was much too large and looked a little frumpy because of the longer length.","I wish I had gone with a 6, I just didnt think it would run this large!","If you are shorter, it will be a very modest length, when I put this on, it reached knee length on me.","I totally wish there was a petite version of this dress to accommodate us shorter girls!"
"6.0","I usually wear a 6 and it was the only size available at the time for this particular dress.","I was in love with the color but unfortunately it didnt fit my large chest.","I am not sure that I would have worn the 8 even if it was available because I think the waist would have been too big.","I think it would be a great dress for anyone with an average size chest."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful and can be dressed down or up for a cocktail or formal evening.","Beware...the zipper has been so used that it is difficult to zip...not smooth at all."
"6.0","Ended up wearing the larger of the two I got, and it was still small in the chest.","I needed a little extra help getting it zipped, and was starting to get uncomfortable by the end of the night.","But everywhere else it fit great.","The color was a little more pink than I expected, but still very beautiful, and got lots of compliments."
"6.0","I didnt love this dress.","The 6 for better than the 8 in the shoulders and I still had to fashion tape the shoulders on.","The bottom half was too tight for my liking in a 6 but the overall for was better in a 6.","I also rented the same silhouette and wore it the next night in beige/silver and it was beautiful on camera."
"6.0","This shirt has a great print and material.","I wish it would have fit better because I really liked the look of it and still got compliments even though the fit was off.","The straps were slipping non-stop and the chest area just didnt work for me."
"6.0","The zipper did not stay up.","Beautiful dress.","Very heavy fabric.....should be worn in the cooler months."
"6.0","The gown is gorgeous, I didnt wear a bra and wish it had more support, or tape.","The front of the dress dropped my natural breast down due to the weight of the dress.","If I had tape this probably would have been different.","It was uncomfortable to sit in because it would pull up into my neck and I felt it choking me for the first moments while sitting.","If you hike the dress up before sitting you will avoid this problem.","The last thing would be that it was very itchy under the arms with all the sequence.","Other than these issues it was a great fit, I just wish I would have figured out my breast situation sooner.","I got many compliments, the back of the dress was my favorite part.","Great length, too, I wore 1 inch heels and you could see my toes.","The dress is longer in the back though and stands beautifully (see photos).","If youre deciding on whether or not to do this dress I recommend it, with a nice up do or perfect down curls and red lips.","I was rushed getting ready and didnt feel as beautiful as I had liked to, but it look very nice.","I probably would have done a zero, because the 2 ran a little big."
"6.0","Not great for well-endowed bust.","pleating/ ruching at waist band can be either very forgiving or quite cruel.","In my case, it wasnt forgiving.","More nude/ bronzy than I expected, but pretty.","Straps not meant for a short stature.","Just didnt work for me.",":("
"6.0","I was optimistic about this jumpsuit based on previous reviews.","However, I was unable to wear it due to it being too short in the torso.","This is a common problem for me with jumpsuits and rompers since I have a long torso and Im 6 tall."
"6.0","This dress was very cute and colorful!!","I loved the cut of it as well.","It does have pockets which is cute, but they poke out some making me look a little hippy.","I didnt like the way it photographed though.","I thought it made me look bigger than I am!"
"6.0","I loved the emerald green of this dress, and the color looks great in photos and in person.","I thought the cut of the dress was not the most flattering from the front as the line fell too low- instead of falling on my upper rib area it fell more on my waist which I thought made my hips look wide.","Also, to note, Im 54 and ordered both the 2P and 4P.","I ended up wearing the 2P and the dress was still long.","I wore three inch heels and still had to pick up the dress when I walked.","I also wore the earrings that are in the website photo and loved them.","Overall, great experience with Rent the Runway but I probably would not rent this dress again due to the fit."
"6.0","The color is stunning, but the hem is heavily stained.","Definitely for a much taller person.","With 4 inch heels I still had like a foot of fabric left."
"6.0"," I am not that tall and it was short.","I felt as thought it didnt look as nice in person.","For being a Trina Turk and an expensive dress (retail) I was not impressed.","Loved the colors and design but during seem as high of quality as I hoped it would be."
"6.0","I loved the vibrant colors and the thick fabric with stretch.","It was short, though, esp.","if you have any bum or thighs.","The bust is flattering for smaller chested gals.","It shows your tummy, so keep that in mind!","It felt fun and flirty on and my husband thought I looked hot!"
"6.0","I thought it would be big, roomy and poncho like but it was much larger than I predicted in the M/L.","I am usually a size 10."
"6.0","I love love love the color and top of this dress.","I shape of the dress was not my favorite.","I think I would have like it better if it was a bit shorter and probably with heels instead of the booties that I chose.","It is a comfy dress but probably needed to double spanx it for this dress!"
"6.0","gorgeous in the pictures, but didnt notice the big bow in the back.","it makes this look very young.","also my sleeves were a little worn out so they were not as tight fitting as I would have liked them to be."
"6.0","This was sent to me as a back-up when my original dress wasnt available.","It was too dressy for the garden party I was attending, but in addition to that was huge in the bust.","Im a 36C, and although the dress fit in the waist and hips, I wouldnt have been able to keep it up.","Definitely a good choice for women with larger chests though."
"6.0","This for the most part ran true to size.","Initially I tried the 18W and at first I thought it fit but it looked very frumpy.","I tried the 16W and it was much better.","I liked the sleeves and thought the length was perfect.","I am 57 and it hit right above the knee.","Very comfy dress and I didnt need spans to hide any bumps and bulges."
"6.0","This coat is beautiful, but I was swimming in it.","I am between an XS and a S, and I rented this in an S. I would recommend going a size down.","I love the detail of the light pink stripe.","Overall, the coat was warm and pretty, and I would definitely rent this again in a smaller size."
"6.0","This dress isnt made for short girls.","I love herve leger but the compression didnt work on my body- the part of the dress that is supposed to suck in the love handles actually fell below my love handles- pushing them out even more.","It was too bad because the dress was gorgeous."
"6.0","I was eager to try this dress after reading the other reviews, but I sent it back unworn after finding it far far too small in the bust (I wear a DD cup) and unforgiving in the midsection.","Other reviews have said the material is akin to spanx in its ability to pull you in but I did not find that to be the case at all.","For the bust, it wasnt just tight and showy, but completely smooshed me in an unflattering way.","I recommend sizing up."
"6.0","Unfortunately, I actually did not wind up wearing this dress, but I would have worn a size 4 (I usually am a 6), as it runs a little big.","The cut and style were great - the skirt is not super short.","I will note that because of the sequins, it is not very comfortable.","They are a little bit scratchy, which would have probably would have been very irritating for a long night out."
"6.0","I wore this for my birthday date/Halloween.","I had trouble choosing which size to wear.","The 8 was a little small, and the arms holes were restricting; but the 10 was a little big and made me look bigger than I am.","I needed a Goldilocks size for this outfit (not too big, not too small, but just right), and it just didnt work for me.","I ended up wearing the 8 and just dealt with the limited mobility of my arms.","It was cute, but I didnt LOVE it."
"6.0","Def runs smaller, rented a 2 shouldve went with a 4, very low cut, need to forgo or have a very deep cut bra.","Will try to size up in the future."
"6.0","I wore this for my bachelorette party and WOW was it a showstopper!","I got compliments all night.","The fit was a little large - I think I could have gotten away with a small.","It wasnt exactly form fitting (which can sometimes be a good thing), but I dont think its how this dress is supposed to fit.","Also the sequins made the fabric bulge slightly in places, but it was really only noticeable when sitting down.","All in all Im happy I rented this dress, I just wish I had gotten the small as well."
"6.0","I wore this dress to a retail industry panel in NYC.","The event had no dress code, but no tees and jeans obviously.","The fabric is slightly shimmery and has some stretch to it, which makes the dress very easy to wear since there is no zipper.","Im 54 and the dress hits me approximate 2-3 inches above the knees.","I felt comfortable and confident in the dress and did not feel too overdresses for the occasion."
"6.0","I was looking to venture into trying the romper style for a 30th Wedding Anniversary at a boat marina.","I knew it would be over 100 degrees and out on the water, a dress or jeans would not be comfortable.","This romper was my backup option when the other style could not be shipped.","I was thrilled to be getting it as my replacement - it is as pretty in person as the pictures - color and print is gorgeous!","Both the XS-S fit the same on this romper.","I opted for the S to give just a little more fabric on my thighs.","This romper ruffle is the only fabric that falls past the butt  (I am 52).","The top was very loose and I chose to pin it closed instead of wearing a camisole (as I saw another RTR do).","I wore a pushup bra to try to fill in the top and keep my curves.","CON:  I said it is not flattering on petites because it hits at the natural waist (smallest part of waist) and left the bottom part large on me (see picture) and did not show off my small, petite frame instead making me look larger.","HOWEVER  it was comfortable, perfect for the 100 degrees sitting outside next to the water.","The fabric moved with the breeze and I felt pretty (received compliments from the 50yr+ crowd about how youthful my outfit was).","The color, print and top looked cute in all selfies and Im glad I tried it.","RTR is great for trying new styles and sizes."
"6.0","This dress is pretty.","Not for me though.","Its a liiiiitle too conservative.The arms were also uncomfortably snug."
"6.0","Overall dress fits very well.","I had no issues with fit or length.","It is comfortable to dance with if you are going to a wedding.","However I thought dress would look sexier because of the slits.","My feeling is that the lace shoulders made it look matronly, and my hairdo did not help that.","Also was not happy about dress being smelly and having deodorant marks when it was delivered.","However customer service was excellent and they offered some options for me.","Overall very happy with RTR service."
"6.0","Unfortunately I was unable to wear the dress because it was too small.","My hips and waist are quite small, so I was surprised that I was barely able to zipper it."
"6.0","I really loved the fit and fabric of this dress, but wasnt so sure about how poofy the skirt was.","Having young kids, I worried it looked like I had a little bump to hide.","The skirt really flares out and has more volume than I expected.","I had to pass on this one."
"6.0","Such a fun a flirty dress, my only issue with it was that it doesnt really have any shape whatsoever.","It would be great for people with a bit of a mid section or those expecting but I felt like I was wearing a garbage bag."
"6.0","I liked the color and cut of the top and wish I had gotten a S.  I may have liked the fit a little bit better and been more inclined to wear it.","You definitely cant wear a normal bra.","I wore a strapless with a bandeau over it.","It still looked super cute from the back.","Im not one to go without a bra, but Im sure thats what would work best... or a NuBra.","The top is a beautiful shade of pink and definitely a standout, but I personally didnt like the way it fit around the stomach.","This could have been because I needed a small - Im not sure.","But it poofed out very strangely - just a little too much.","Also, the top of the back was a little weird with how angled the cut was, but still cute and definitely made it more dressy than casual.","Maybe if I had put it with white pants or something, it would have been better."
"6.0","Totally here for the sparkle effect!","LOVED that about this dress.","I received tons of compliments.","Even in a black dress, I stood out.","I liked the long sleeves, because though I was in LA, its still February, so it was appropriate.","The V-neck is very deep, so youd have to be comfortable showing cleavage.","I wasnt able to wear a bra without it showing, so perhaps invest in some fashion tape.","I didnt care for the fit of the dress.","I worse the XS, and the body of the dress, esp.","at the bottom was big and loose.","Thats my only critique.","If youre on the thinner side, this may not be the best choice."
"6.0","Loved the quality and cut of this dress, but the top was a bit too snug with the back strap attached.","The 6 fit my lower half perfectly, but I had to wear the 8 with the strap undone to be able to breathe.","The quality of the dress was great, and I loved the subtle but sexy lace detail.","I dont recommend this for anyone with a broad upper half or large bust."
"6.0","The fir of this sweater was great.","The ribbing gave it a really great fit around the waist and the fabric wasnt itchy or anything.","This was an instance of a style just not working for me.","The ruffles + the color  made it look a little like wings, reading a little costumy.","I couldnt really pull it off."
"6.0","This jumpsuit is really on trend for this spring, so I REALLY wanted to love it.","But the fit is weird--the bodice is really tight, so this particular piece will not fit busty girls.","The neckline is also lower than it seems in the photo.","And then below the waist it blouses out a little on the hip--makes you seem bigger in the hip.","Also, the fabric--like I said, I really wanted to love it.","But the print looks a little more like curtains than a floral you want to wear."
"6.0","This is an empire waisted gown, so it is tight in the rib cage and poofs outward.","I rented this for an evening Great Gatsby style wedding, but ended up not wearing it.","I think it is more appropriate for a cocktail, new years or Vegas."
"6.0","I loved this dress!","Its actually more on the gold side in person.","STUNNING!","I am pretty busty (as you can see in the dress) and the invisible zipper was stuck.","I contacted customer service and they had a different dress that I liked they overnighted.","It was perfect!"
"6.0","So soft and fabulous, but way too big.","Would have loved to wear it."
"6.0","So the dress itself is gorgeous....however, the other reviews were spot on about the sequins rubbing on your inner arms all night.","The next morning my arms were raw.","I ended up wearing the 8L instead of the 6L- and the long was not as long as I was hoping for, but it worked well enough with 3 inch heels."
"6.0","too short!!!","!"
"6.0","I rented this as a back up for a Labor Day wedding in Maine.","The dress was fairly heavy, with a lot of underlayers underneath.","I think this would be a great pick for sometime later in the fall - but it was much too warm for it on Labor Day."
"6.0","I wore this to an art exhibit for a friend of mine.","The print was perfect for the occasion.","Like most have said on here, the undergarments show if you are curvy.","I wore with tights because it was cold and to help support my tummy.","The scuba material is thick and warm."
"6.0","The color on this dress is fantastic!","I did t find much difference between the small and medium other than a one-inch length difference, so I wore the medium- it is definitely a short dress!!","This dress shows its popularity by looking a little worn, but still got compliments all night."
"6.0","All the existing reviews were very accurate.","The colors and fabric are gorgeous.","And, its true to size.","However, the dress was a lot for me to manage.","I have a relatively small bust (34C/36B), and the neckline is very low.","I pinned it, but still felt very self-conscious all night.","I also ordered a 10L because the 10R and 12R werent available.","Im 57, and I definitely didnt need the Long.","I wore 3 in heels, and it was still too long.","It was a lot of fabric to manage all night.","And, as everyone has mentioned, the waist band is very tight.","I have a relatively small waist, and the band was still very tight on me.","Overall, its a gorgeous dress and would look amazing on the right person.","If you get the right length, have a small rib cage, and can fill up the bust line, this is a beautiful, effortless dress.","But, this wasnt the dress for me.","Nonetheless, I loved my first Rent the Runway experience, and will definitely do it again!"
"6.0","I ended up taking this off half way through the party and changing into something in my suitcase.","The top was just to itchy and scratchy, it was a constant distraction -- I was trying to keep my arms away from my sides at all times because it hurt.","I also thought it was too short, and I dont typically mind a bit of a shorter dress.","Something about it being so short but also so full on the bottom just looked like I was trying to hard to look like a teenager."
"6.0","Very pretty and unique!","Even more vibrant in person.","I think a 4 wouldve been perfect.","Didnt get to wear it - it was obviously too big."
"6.0","The fit was a bit loose and not flattering.","I found that the blouse was too big around the torso.","I didnt end up wearing it out."
"6.0","The fit was definitely small, so Im glad I sized up for the second size.","However, that dress seems to have too much wear: the zipper kept sticking (very frustrating), the inner corset had painful wires sticking out and into my skin, and the inner buckle wouldnt stay closed so that also rubbed against my side.","Otherwise, it would have been very comfortable!"
"6.0","I ordered this as part of my Unlimited membership for weekend wear.","I honestly feel like it looks nothing like the picture.","The quality seems cheap and the colors are drab.","The d shape is strange too - the picture looks like a v-neck cut but its a strange scoop."
"6.0","Clingy fabric - did not feel it had the same classic and conservative look that most DVF dresses have.","Fit a little strange and showed every line."
"6.0","I got this blouse for work and was also planning to accessorize and wear out.","And that was a great plan because it is a very pretty, sophisticated blouse that has presence.","But.... it was huge.","Vince.","is a great brand, and I love a lot of their clothes, but the sizing is erratic.","Sometimes the stuff is huge, and this was one of those instances.","Its suppose to be loose/flowy, but this was a tent.","Returned it without wearing.","If there was an XXS I would definitely try again, but the XS was more like a Medium."
"6.0","This dress is pretty and well made, but it does run big and if you need to wear a bra, I dont see how you can without showing it.","I wore this dress for work, so I put a black tank top underneath and a black blazer over it to keep it conservative and that worked well.","The 42 is perfect for work, especially since I put a tank top under it, but if I had chose this dress for going out I would have sized down as it does run large.","Also this dress definitely accentuates curves and gives the illusion of an hour glass figure.","Im not very hippy, but I felt this dress gave me hips.","I actually think it made me seem bigger than I really am.","So if youre looking for something slimming, this isnt the dress for you."
"6.0","It was short and kept riding up which I had to keep adjusting to pull it down.","But overall the fit was good and received many compliments on it!"
"6.0","The dress ran big, so I had to wear a sweater on top.","I looked frumpy in it."
"6.0","I rented this dress when I was still trying to hide an early baby bump, and it worked great for that.","However, the way the waist starts high in the front and drops low in the back was just not flattering on me.","It made it look like my waist was much lower than it is and thus much thicker as well.","Probably wont be renting again."
"6.0","You will have stand up straight, shoulda back the entire time wearing this dress.","The clasp in the back of  the dress was half missing, which meant that if I leaned back on my chair the part of the clasp that was still attached dug into my back.","Be forewarned this is a possibility.","There isnt a slit in the dress.","If going up stairs or getting in a car you have to lift the dress up far enough to achieve comfort."
"6.0","This dress was stunning and I got compliments all night.","HOWEVER, it runs very long.","The model in the picture must be around 510 because on me, the dress went to my shins which made it appear frumpy and matronly, which is not a good look.","I was so disappointed I attempted to find another dress at the RTR store in SF, but ultimately stuck with it because it really is beautiful.","The picture you see here was after I used hemming tape to lift the hem around 5 inches.","While this worked, I was paranoid all night that the tape would unstick, or Id damage the dress unintentionally.","I wouldnt recommend renting this if youre on the short side, it just wasnt worth the stress."
"6.0","I rented this dress for my best friends birthday party, as it was good for pear shape and the price point was amazing... i am a true size 12, and this dress was laughable on me.","I honestly thought i put it on wrong TWICE because the slit was so high, you would have seen all my secrets.","I am hippy, and this dress is supposed to hug those curves, but my curves were too much, and it made this weird gap in the slit/bottom half of the dress.","I showed my husband and he asked where the other half of the dress was.","If you are hippy, i dont recommend you attempt this one.","or size up at least 2 sizes.","The top was gorgeous, and i am bummed this didnt work out.","It looks gorgeous on other gals."
"6.0","Black dresses/jumpers with a fun neckline and back are always great.","I was turned off by the puffiness of the skort and the dramatic change from the sleek neckline and fitted waist to the flowy wide shorts.","7 or 8 out of 10.","Better for straighter frames and not awesome for curves.","I didnt wear it as it was almost costume like on me."
"6.0","I wore this under a blue blazer for work and I loved it!","The fit was true to size and can easily be dressed up or down."
"6.0","Fit is roomy through the middle.","Dress is flattering but I would suggest sizing down for your extra size.","It is forgiving material."
"6.0","It was a bit loose for me.","It should have hung high above my waist but it was quite low.","Was a bit weird.","Too much leather for my liking."
"6.0","I was thinking it would be a shift dress but it was far more form fitting than intended.","Some needs were coming undone when I received it."
"6.0","It was too long for my short torso.","Beautiful color, I wish it fit better on me.","I ended up not wearing it."
"6.0","I have a classic hourglass, 31 inch waist and size 32G bra.","The 14 was too big and the 12 would not zip over my chest.","Unfortunate as it seemed to work for a lot of other people with a large chest it seems."
"6.0","the bottom was TTS, but the top was HUGE.","definitely not for smaller-chested ladies.","was fine otherwise."
"6.0","Got this as my back up and I loved it, however it was too large.","Would definitely rent smaller size next time."
"6.0","This is a really pretty and fun dress, but RTR only had the 8, which was a little too big for me.","I would have loved this is the proper size!"
"6.0","I rented this for my birthday.","I am 52 and the description said (and the stylist at RTR when I talked to them) said it was made for someone starting at 52 and going up to like 58 or something.","I was worried it would be too long and I was right.","I couldnt even wear this with 10 inch heels.","Since it was the night before my event I couldnt get a replacement :(.","Short, petite girls, this one might not be for you."
"6.0","RTR sent this dress to me as a substitute because another dress I ordered was damaged.","Its a beautiful dress and gave me a very elegant hourglass shape, not to mention it still had the tags on it and had never been worn!","I ultimately chose not to wear it because it was so tight around my knees that I could barely walk.","I would definitely not rent this if you will be doing any dancing.","Could be a great choice for a luncheon or bridal/baby shower."
"6.0","This dress is gorgeous.","However, the top is cut really weird.","It fit perfectly, except this one little area on the sides at the top.","it puckered out, and i would have been incredibly uncomfortable/self conscious in this dress.","I did see another girl at the same event wearing it, though, and she wasnt having that issue.","Not sure what it was about my body type, but I sure am glad I had a back up!"
"6.0","This dress is really cute but if you have any type of butt or larger hips, then it is going to be too tight to wear and be comfortable.","I tried it on and it fit great up top.","And even though I usually wear a 6 or a 8, this 8 was soooo snug.","Just be careful with this dress if your butt or hips are on the bodacious side."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this.","It ran very small on top.","The bottom and color were beautiful.","If you have any kind of chest, size up."
"6.0","I loved the material and color of this dress, but it is so short I could barely move my arms!","I would recommend sizing up to get more length."
"6.0","The dress fits fabulously.","If you have curves (aka wide hips) - this dress works well.","HOWEVER, the dress if very costumey up close.","The lapels and nude mesh over the bust made me think I was Kristi Yamaguchi competing at the 92 Olympics (seriously, look it up...same dress).","Which is too bad - because had the lapels not been there, this would have been a show stopper.","Now, I didnt end up wearing this, but it did fit true to size."
"6.0","the dress is really made for someone with a long torso.","It had an unusual fit for someone my height.","It is a lovely gown in person and I was truly heartbroken because I couldnt wear it to the ball."
"6.0","It is super cute, but there is a LOT more frill than looks in the picture.","I felt like big bird!","I wore it on Easter and kept doing the chicken dance.","If you are all about making a statement and standing out, this is for you!"
"6.0","Im athletic, muscular...almost always a size 4.","I ordered a size 6 as my backup and even that was almost too small.","If youve got larger breasts and strong lats or a muscular back maybe dont get strapless dress online.","The waist of the 6 was too large, but the top almost too small.","The length was shorter than I had hoped despite all the comments that it was too long.","I love the ease of the site and how they can accessorize for you.","I cant wait to rent my next gown, just maybe not a strapless ;)"
"6.0","It would have been a beautiful dress but the fit was off on the bust area.","If you have a bigger chest, I suggest ordering a size up."
"6.0","Was very tight on the bum!","The colors are pretty and I loved the dress, but would be more comfortable wearing it to a bachelorette party or a night out!"
"6.0","This dress was very pretty and went perfectly with my tea party themed bridal shower.","The fit was the biggest problem though.","The dress has a very snug underlining and the top is very large.","You would have to have a big bust and straight body to accommodate this fit which overall made me look larger.","I ended up wearing the 12 instead of my normal size 10.","I added a small belt to try and cinch the top.","Paired with nude heels and mint green necklace."
"6.0","Silky dress with a lovely floral pattern!","The length was just a little to awkward for me, and wasnt very slimming so I looked like I was wearing a sleep dress"
"6.0","Unlimited rental so was worth trying out but didnt fit a 53 person with a short torso well.","Neckline too low for me but might work for others.","Conclusion is to try it out!"
"6.0","I ended up wearing the Medium although it was rather large.","The Small (my backup size) was just too short so I had to go with the Medium to feel more comfortable.","Pretty color but not that flattering on the shape."
"6.0","Large even on tall frame.","Very cozy and comfortable."
"6.0","Cute shirt but not amazing.","Wore it once and sent it back."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing it as it was just too short.","I could have worn it with tights and a bootie but I just wasnt feeling it that day."
"6.0","The dress was very comfy and super cute!","It just isnt designed for short people.","The 3/4 length sleeves were full length on me, and the skirt went all the way to the knee.","I still wore it, but definitely could have gone at least a size smaller."
"6.0","This dress fit around the waist but was too big in the chest and shoulders.","This dress was also too long, it would have been much more flattering if it was about 3 inches shorter.","This dress would probably look great on a tall, curvy girl, but was not super flattering on more of a petite size."
"6.0","I rented this with plans to bring it on a beach vacation.","But, it didnt quite fit right, so I sent it back unworn.","I am normally a size 6/8, so I rented the Medium.","Im 54 and about 140 pounds.","The waist is cinched and it hit me above my belly button, so well above my actual waist.","The material has no stretch, except at the waist, and was actually almost tight on the zipper in the back.","I could have worn this, but overall with the waist so high and therefore the inseam coming up so high, I thought it didnt look very flattering, so I just decided to send it back."
"6.0","The fabric of this dress is substantial and looks/feels expensive.","The dress has a high fashion look, but the style (particularly the longer outer layer) may be overwhelming on a petite frame.","It definitely runs small; I was able to get the XS on, but it was very snug - I recommend sizing up, especially if you have wider hips or a large bust.","I ultimately ended up choosing a different dress for my event."
"6.0","This dress is such a beautiful color and shape to it and I would love to rent it again even though I did not end up wearing it.","Unfortunately the dress had a bit of an odor to it so I had to call and get another dress overnighted to me.","I felt that it was a bit tight on me in the chest area but it would have been wearable.","When I sat down the dress puffed up a bit and shortened but its easily something that you could deal with."
"6.0","The dress fits incredibly well and is a nice light chiffon.","The only problem is the zipper is quite difficult and was very hard to get zipped."
"6.0","The dress material is GORGEOUS and definitely a show stopper...but the material is a little heavy with not much structure so it kind of hangs.","I definitely shouldve sized down to the 8R instead of the 10 but I had just returned a 10 in a different dress for being a little snug so I was nervous.","Anyways, I wore this to a military ball and got a lot of compliments.","It seems more seasonally appropriate for somewhere around the holidays, Nov-Jan.","The dress was lined so that was nice.","The straps were very long and the v was very deep.","I had to pin the straps up.","This might have been better if I wouldve sized down."
"6.0","I was hoping to wear this to work but because Im flat chested, the chest area was way too revealing for a corporate setting.","The jumpsuit also ran large, I usually wear a size 4 but shouldve sized down to a 2."
"6.0","This top is incredibly small.","I had to wear a tank under it because it fits like a crop top.","It was tight too (and Im very small boned).","If I had ordered up the sleeves would have been too long.","Nice quality and I did wear it but wasnt very comfortable."
"6.0","The style of the dress is really nice.","It can be dressed up with heels or more casual with bright tights and flats.","Wrap dresses are universally pretty flattering, but I just couldnt get this one to lay quite right.","No matter how I tied it, the dress would bunch up around the waist or would make the neckline plunge too deep.","Fabric was more sheer that expected.","Lesson: Wear a slip"
"6.0","Cuter on the model.","Its very very boxy and long in the sleeves"
"6.0","Made from quality material but I wish this style had petite sizes.","Runs large, hip area was very loose for me."
"6.0","First, the wardrobe package that the dresses arrived in had a jammed zipper and did not unzip all the way.","It was annoying to negotiate the bag with a jammed zipped.","I ordered the dress in a 0R and 2R.","The 0R I received had a defect in that for some reason, the back of the dress was shorter than the front of the dress.","It was also too short for my 55 height.","So, if youre ordering a ), I would recommend 0L if you are 55 and over.","The 0R fit my bust and hip area perfectly, and I probably would have worn it anyway, but the asymmetrical defect was just too much.","I had to go with the 2R.","The 2R was actually perfect for my height and hit my 3inch heels perfectly.","The problem was that the sleeves, the bust area, and the hip area were now too big on me.","The rouching in the hips made my butt look lumpy.","If I had the dress in a 0L, I probably would have been a lot happier.","The wedding I went to was on a boat for the cocktail hour.","It kept me pretty warm without a coat."
"6.0","The dress is beautiful and obviously very well made but I wish the Small had been available because I would have been much more comfortable.","The XS fit, but with no extra room.","I was still able to dance, walk and breathe (ha) normally - its tight but not restrictive.","The dress would certainly have been more flattering if it hadnt hugged me quite so close, though."
"6.0","Fit well and was a stunning blue color!","I ended up wearing a full length dress, but would have worn this for a less formal event."
"6.0","Unfortunately I had to send back this dress without wearing it because it was way too long.","I am 52 and wore the 8 and it went to my ankles.","I am used to dresses being a little long on me, but this one was so much different than pictured on the model.","I also probably couldve gone down to a 6 (the knit top has quite a bit of stretch) but I doubt it would have shortened it very much."
"6.0","WONDERFUL!"
"6.0","I wanted it to fit really loose which it did (except over the chest, which is fine, as I was expecting that, since I know Im well endowed in that arena :).","It looked ok, but the fabric was just too heavy/not breathable for the warm springtime NYC weather were having right now.","Its a better cold weather item, I think."
"6.0","This is a pretty dress.","The fabric was a wonderful silky fabric with a fair amount of strength.","I was surprised by how big it ran.","I could belt it, but the dress would look much better if it was more fitted rather than big.","I am between a 22 and 20 and I normally size up, but I could have used the 20 in this instance.","Customer service was very helpful."
"6.0","Ive got a wider hip then my bust area (32 bust, 36 hip) so I thought the cut of this dress with a larger, flowing bottom would be perfect for me.","I also love how the hemline is longer in the back.","But honestly this dress did not fit me very well.","It looked more like sheath on me.","I dont know if you can tell from the picture too well but It did not fit me at the waist like on the model and it flared out way too much on me.","The quality of fabric was good and the dress had a nice nude lining inside built in (so you would not need nude undergarments).","I wore the other dress to my pre destination wedding, send off party."
"6.0","the dress fits snugly so I would size up .. and as other reviewers noted, it wrinkles."
"6.0","The fabric is like a sweater material so it was warm on a cold fall day.","It has a weird fit.","It ran really small in the shoulders and the sleeve length was too short but it was really roomy in the body.","I tied it as tight as I could but there was still so much room in it; I had to wear a camisole underneath because it was cut really low.","I think this would be a great dress for a shorter, fuller woman."
"6.0","Super flattering and sparkly!","Not the most comfortable material in the world."
"6.0","This dress is short.","Im 60 and it was too short on me.","I had a medium and a large.","I am usually a size 6, but the medium was too small."
"6.0","I rented this dress for an April wedding.","While it is a beautiful dress, you could definitely tell it had been worn a lot.","There were several pulls and loose strings.","That is probably due in large part to the material.","I still got lots of compliments but my overall opinion was that it looked very worn."
"6.0","Beautiful dress, but the stitching on the side buckled and made my hips look way larger; not flattering on me at all.","I actually gave it to my mother who has no hips to wear instead."
"6.0","I am 59 and 150 lbs and usually wear a 6 in dresses.","I am very small up top and bigger on the bottom.","I ordered the 6 and the 8 as a back up.","The 6 fit in the body but the hem around my legs was SO tight I could barely walk so I had to wear the 8.","The dress is ALL sequins which I did not realize.","It looked beautiful but it did rub me just a tad along the arms.","Overall, I would recommend this dress but if you are pear shaped, size up."
"6.0","This dress runs large.","Wouldnt suggest it for anyone under 57 or 120 lbs because it is very flowy."
"6.0","I rented this top for everyday casual and to wear to work.","The top fit well but was very short on me.","I am tall at 59 and have a long torso, so this is probably specific to me, the side slit almost came up to the bottom of my bra.","In my photo I am wearing high waisted jeans and it was still a bit short for me to wear to work comfortably.","The sweater is also pretty heavy in weight, its a true wool, would be great for winter but a bit hot for May."
"6.0","Great fabricLarge Fit - Ended up having to temporarily alter the dress to make it fit  Sticky tape would not work due to the large amount of fabric that needed to be taken in.","."
"6.0","I rented this dress as a wedding guest because the reviews made me feel it was appropriate.","I did not end up wearing this dress because it was extremely sparkly and I felt very heavy.","Even if you are smaller (Im 54, 122 lbs), I think if you have curves (Im a 34 full C) the dress makes you look heavier.","Recommend for less curvy and perhaps taller girls!"
"6.0","Very fitted around wrists and neck.","The collar detail does not appear to be refined in person.","It has a light floral pattern.","I would have preferred a collar that was solid white.","The material is thick and stretchy, which really hugs my curves.","However, the weather was way too warm to truly enjoy the dress so I didnt wear it."
"6.0","Very glamorous dress but the fit wasnt right for me.","It would have been a great length in short heels but I felt it wasnt flattering up top.","Very tight at my bra band and needed help zipping."
"6.0","This is lightweight, good for spring/summer/fall.","Not warm enough for Chicago winter time.","The cotton shirt will need ironing.","The large seemed to fit right on me.","My husband said it was nice.","I thought it was OK, I was expecting it to look higher end."
"6.0","The inner lining was tight.","The dress was very pretty, but didnt fit.","Size up if you have a larger chest."
"6.0","Im short, so even with heels the dress was long.","It was also incredibly big from the bust.","All of the reviews said that, so I figured with an 8 I would be ok--I also didnt want it to be too tight in the waist.","It fit really well in the waist so I wouldnt have been able to size down, but I needed a lot of pins to fix the top.","Because there was so much cloth to pin there was no easy way to do it so I dont think the dress looked as nice as it could have."
"6.0","Was sad that I could not wear this.","The size I ordered actually fit everywhere and was so cute except one issue-I am short and have a short torso as well as a large chest.","It cut way too low underneath my armpits and left me with exposed side boob.","I felt like I would be self conscious all night so I opted for a dress I already have.","Boo."
"6.0","Runs large and loose, and was a bit on the short side which worked fine for me since I have a short torso.","I would go down a size, and if you have a long torso Id probably skip this one.","It ended up being very cute with fitted, slim leg black trousers and 5 inch stilettos.","I dont think Id rent again simply because I favor fitted clothing but Im glad I took a chance on trying something new."
"6.0","I rented it for a cocktail party but didnt wear it because I could smell the previous renters deodorant right out of the garment bag.","Thats why I gave it three stars.","Its a shame because the dress fit amazingly well!","It hugged and gave in all the right places, and its so pretty.","But I couldnt wear it with the odor."
"6.0","It fit great everywhere except for felt really tight under my bust."
"6.0","This dress was just okay to me...Fit true to size.","The midi length just wasnt very flattering on me.","Im 56.","The fabric was really nice and classy looking.","The cutouts were in a spot that showed my strapless bra so I wore a jacket over it.","Would not recommend for full bust women.","Overall a very classic look just nothing WOW."
"6.0","I wish I could give this dress a higher rating for all the beautiful photos it produced with me wearing it, but I guess beauty is PAIN!","Beware the sequins- each time I grabbed, it was inevitable that one would catch under my nail and result in a tiny cut, which was quite unpleasant.","The boning was fine- although the dress sent to me perhaps was a bit faulty, the right side inverted at the edge and the left side jabbed my ribcage.","I am naturally pretty thin and flat, but dont usually have so many problems with strapless dresses...this one, because it was so heavy, caused a bit of distress.","Even with the size 0, I wore multiple layers of padding to keep it up and had to stick my chest out all night to keep it from falling to my ribcage.","other than the ill fit top half and the dangerous sequins (watch out for the train, too!","may catch in your stiletto if not careful) the dress was gorgeous and I received many compliments on it.","the bottom fit just fine, length was perfect - although remember that if you hike it up a bit it will be shorter, so theres some wiggle room there.","Perhaps Badgley Mischka and I are just not meant to be :( finally a note to RTR- this dress came to me complete with blonde hair stuck inbetween the sequins... please take better care to clean your items first next time!"
"6.0","Not really a-line, fits a little tighter than most Shoshana dresses."
"6.0","I read most of the reviews and a fair amount said they wore this dress wearing a regular bra.","I tried several different bras and just couldnt make it work with any of them.","I wasnt confident there wouldnt be a wardrobe malfunction if I went without the added support of a bra so sadly didnt end up wearing the dress.","If you have smaller chest it might work better -- the dress is stunning and I would have loved to wear it if not for the issue of the bra peaking from the sides."
"6.0","I ended up not even wearing this dress.","In pictures, it was exactly what I wanted.","I even went up a size based on previous reviews, but that wasnt enough.","The dress was still fairly tight and not flattering at all."
"6.0","The dress was very pretty and good quality, but something about it didnt fit me right.","The 6L and the 8L seemed like the exact same size, but I went with the 8L because it was a bit longer.","Spanx might have helped, but it was almost like it was too big and too small at the same time.","i felt like a pretty red blob actually.","The bottom was great though and flowed beautifully when I walked.","Awkwardly my boss and I wore the exact same dress to the wedding.","Guess RTR is popular!"
"6.0","Very cute chambray dress, but the cut of the dress is narrow (as pictured) and has absolutely no stretch.","It would be very cute with a belt, but size up if you have any doubts on size."
"6.0","I really loved the pattern on this dress, the material, and the fit - except for the length.","I was very comfortable for the most part, and the dress looked great, but it is definitely much shorter than expected.","I wore this to a bridal shower at a Syrian restaurant where we all took belly dancing lessons (yes, super fun!","), and lifting my arms just a bit would have shown my lady parts to everyone there!",":D  Definitely would recommend but probably for someone 55 or under."
"6.0","The dress is amazing!","It is a little heavy and warm so be sure to check the weather.","You will also need a lint brush as this dress collects everything it comes in contact with."
"6.0","I loved the color of this dress for a summer wedding.","It was a little snug in the hips and shoulder straps were big so it didnt sit properly on.","Still I loved it and got tons of compliments."
"6.0","Doesnt allow for a lot of movement.","Lace is restrictive and was a little too short for someone 510"
"6.0","This dress is so comfortable.","It has a nice stretch to it that makes it hug in all the right places and forgive in others.","I orginially ordered the 6 and then read reviews and changed to a 4.","I think the 2 would have been perfect.","It was too big on the top and the shoulders tended to slip off.","Overall, it was great for the event and got lots of envious looks."
"6.0","It was a beautiful color.Bright but pretty.","I wear a size 4 normally but went with the size 6 because the lining underneath was very form fitting."
"6.0","I feel as though there are two versions of this dress.","The material itself was thin and not of high quality.","Reminded me on material you would find on juniors clothing, in addition the color was more of a burgundy not a bright red as is pictured (and i noticed in other customers pictures this same variation), nor could I find the designers label on  it.","However it fit nicely and I was able to wear it to work.","The only thing I noticed about the fit is that it is a sheath cut and therefore it you have any curves it may not fit exactly perfect.","I noticed the back hem fell a little shorter than the front due so me having curves in the back.","However it wasnt too noticeable and still wearable.","The material did have some stretch to it.","Overall decent dress but i would not rent again due to the low quality of the fabric."
"6.0","Let me start off by saying how AMAZING this dress looked on!","Im 59 and ordered the 8L and 10L.","The 8L fit like a glove but hit right at my ankles.","The 10L was long enough, as it covered my feet but not by much.","If  I had gone up to the 12L, Im sure the dress would have been too big.","My only problem with this dress, and the reason why I had to return it, was that I was not able to move my arms higher than a 45* angle.","This was rented for a wedding where a lot of movement and dancing was inevitable, and I was uncomfortable in it due the lack of stretch at the arms.","I actually had marks on my upper forearms from the dress when I took it off.","If I wasnt a bridesmaid for this wedding, I would have gotten the 10L and sucked it up!"
"6.0","The first picture is the beginning of the wedding and the dress fit like a glove.","I mean BAM on every curve.","This was the kind of dress you would want to be wearing when you ran into your ex.","HOWEVER, the second picture is towards the end of the night and you can see around my shoulders and under my chest on the side is all loose.","I was not wearing a bra because I was worried about the straps on the side.","I still said true to size on the review because I wouldnt suggest going any smaller to avoid this issue.","Again the initial fit was perfect but next time I will definitely give my chest a little extra to keep it all together but I want you as a person interested in the dress to know that the material will expand."
"6.0","The dress material is a thick neoprene but I wasnt hot or uncomfortable outside.","Its a beautiful print with vibrant colours.","I chose to wear the small over the medium because the medium was too baggy in the mid section.","The small was tighter, but still slightly baggy.","Every few steps I had to pull the skirt down as it bunches around the hips quite easily.","Maybe not the best pick for an hourglass shape.","Nice dress that looked great in photos but certainly not my favourite!"
"6.0","I had to order a dress in a pinch, and this one worked out fine given the circumstances.","The dress is simple and comfortable, and runs true to size.","I just felt as though it didnt really do anything for my figure."
"6.0","The length of this dress was perfect, I am 52.","The waist and the bust were a little big.","The dress was my third choice of dresses, the other two that I would have preferred were already rented.","I liked the dress but because the waist and bust were a little big it looked a little conservative on me.","I wish RTR had more of a selection for us petite girls.","Right now I see very little selection for an event I have later this month.","Customer service of this company is excellent and if you are average in size I think there is a lot more to choose from."
"6.0","Gorgeous dress!","Only negative thing were the sequins at the top seam were harsh against my skin and slightly uncomfortable, leaving red marks.","Other than that, great fit, didnt have to constantly pull the dress up all night."
"6.0","The dress was cute!","I loved the color.","It was a little longer than I would have liked went over my knees a little.","I probably could have gone down a size but it worked just fine.","Very comfortable!"
"6.0","I ordered this dress for a wedding after a vacation and was hoping for something flowy and slightly form fitting.","It was just flowy and looked like a bean bag on me.","I have seen it on other girls and it looks great!","Just not my style."
"6.0","Cute dress, but was too small in the waist for me (I do not have a very small waist so might work better for more of an hourglass shape).","I was uncomfortable because the tight fit in the waist made my flesh stick out of the cutout.","The rest of the dress fit great, but I didnt end up wearing it.","Beautiful color."
"6.0","The dress is beautiful in person.","It was not flattering on my figure.","I know it is a shift, but it was excessively loose around the middle and a little tight on the hips.","Also that neck line does nothing if you have any extra arm pit fat.","I should have known that from the pictures."
"6.0","I ordered a size 4 and I am a 34B bra, it was too big around my chest area."
"6.0","Love the dress, Its very classy, fits well, super comfortable and the back is beautiful!","I only got one picture all night in it but I like it.","When I tried to steam out the wrinkles though it made some serious water marks.","Luckily Theyre hard to see in pictures and in a dark space but it was a little of a nuisance."
"6.0","I rented several options for a gala I had to attend, and this was a backup dress.","I didnt end up wearing it.","I am very petite, and the length actually worked great with 4-5 heels, but the dress itself was too loose.","The bust area wasnt really fitted, or the body, and the zipper kind of jutted out from the side awkwardly.","It just wasnt very flattering and I decided to wear a different dress.","I wouldnt recommend the dress for someone who is petite, but it is a beautiful gown, and I loved the color!"
"6.0","Felt pretty snug, but looked better than the next size up."
"6.0","I wore this dress for a speaking engagement at a luncheon.","The dress fits true to size and looks very professional.","I liked the fit of the dress although the material is heavy and hot for summer months.","The dress is pretty, but there is nothing particularly special about it.","If you are looking to stand out, this is not the dress for you.","It is very appropriate for work related events."
"6.0","I ordered this for my grandfathers funeral.","I was looking for something really conservative and appropriate, without having to go to the store.","It was nice, and a couple of people complimented me on the dress.","It was a nice dress and fit well in my normal size.","I wore it with black tights and black booties, + some pretty earrings."
"6.0","I was incredibly excited for this blazer because of the print but the fit was so unusual that I returned it without ever wearing it.","The shoulders are somewhat tight and the body is much larger so even if you leave it unbuttoned to accommodate the shoulders, the body of the blazer is so large that its unflattering.","In addition, there is little to no stretch.","Great idea but I would not recommend it to anyone."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful, the color is gorgeous, but Im 54 and it was way too long."
"6.0","Not a show-stopper like most the RTR rentals, but was perfect for dinner with the girls.","I judge my RTRs rating on how many compliments I get.","On this one I received zero.","Beautiful colors on the front.","Was not a fan of the all black back of the top.","It is pretty short so be aware.","I rented the Large per others comments in hopes it would be a little longer.","They were right."
"6.0","Very pretty and comfortable, although a bit too long even with high heels.","Dancing was barely impossible."
"6.0","Material and color were nice but the dress is pretty baggy and too short for me to wear out (I have long legs though so maybe this wouldnt be a problem for others)"
"6.0","Beautiful dress!","Sweetheart neckline in lining makes sheer lace at top more flattering.","The dress runs true to size.","It has no stretch or slit in the back to if you are ever between sizes go up!","Im normally a 6 in the lower portion and a 10 in the shoulders, this dress was tight in the hips and fine in the shoulders surprisingly.","Spanx are a must to smooth things out as the dress is very form fitted.","Stitching at the waist creates a nice silhouette."
"6.0","This dress was comfortable and the skirt was beautiful and of course pockets are always a plus!","I felt like the fabric of the top was not as dressy as the skirt, but with it being black you could easily dress it up with a necklace or snazzy earrings.","My only issue was that the arm holes were too big, and that created a gap between the front of my shoulder and the dress that was a little awkward.","I felt like I had to wear my hair down to cover it up.","Other than that, it was lovely.","Would definitely work for women with large busts."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful, but I am currently a little curvier than usual, and this dress was a little tight on my hips.","The size 10 fit better on the hips, but the waist was a little boxier.","It has a nice built in corset which helps to hold you in (and you likely wouldnt need to wear a bra), but the fit was simply not flattering on me."
"6.0","So the blazer is very cute.","I love the back, and it looks great with a nice work dress.","My only concern was the front as the fit was quite loose.","And I suppose it would have to be loose with the open back.","I should have thought of that.","I honestly think this jacket would be great if I carried my weight in the waist.","Alas, I do not and that is not my style - so it didnt work for me.","When I am pregnant, though, I am running to the store to try to buy this jacket.","It would be absolutely perfect for a baby bump!","Thats the kind of loose Im talking about."
"6.0","I wish that I could give this dress a better review but it was just uncomfortable to wear.","First off, Im 52 and even with 5 inch heels the dress was still long.","I was constantly picking it up so that I would not trip.","Next, this dress is very tight in the rib cage area.","Based on other reviews I ordered my normal size (4) and a size up (6) and ended up wearing the 6.","The four fit very well on the top but was so extremely tight in the rib cage area that I had to wear the 6.","The 6 ended up being larger than I wouldve liked on top and I had to use a ton of tape and wear bra inserts to attempt to keep the dress in place.","I loved the color and the dress is really pretty but its just uncomfortable."
"6.0","This is a lovely dress, but I was a bit too tall for it and didnt end up wearing it for the event.","Im 510 and the waist/hemline hit too high.","Beautiful color though, and a sexy fit."
"6.0","Cute jacket.","Just a little snug in the arms by the shoulder area.","I thought maybe it was just me yet my 15 year old skinny daughter said the same thing.","It doesnt seem to stretch in the arms."
"6.0","The dress itself is gorgeous.","The design is beautiful and the material is really nice.","I loved the length and style of the dress however I just could not wear this.","The arm holes are TINY so I felt like I had material in my armpits and there is SO much material on the upper half that it flares out in odd places.","Im a 32D too, so I would think anyone would have this issue.","It may work for really talk slender women who can pull the dress down, but then again maybe not."
"6.0","I was swimming in this jacket.","I may try again in a 6 or even a 4."
"6.0","I loved the blues and greens in this dresss skirt, bold and beautiful.","However, the dress fit was weird on me.","As other reviewers have noted, the top can be large on small chested women (I am a 34 B cup).","Im usually a size 4-6, and knowing that the top ran big, I sized down to the 4.","However, the 4 just fit because where the waist comes in (before puffing out to the full skirt) has absolutely no stretch.","This also makes it difficult to zip up if you are a single lady living alone like me.","And even though I sized down, the upper part was still too big around the arms and had extra fabric length wise as well.","The skirt is exceptionally full, so I have included a second pic with a side view to show that.","I am 3 months post abdominal surgery, so this was actually something I wanted in a dress, but I could see it being a surprise to see people just how full the skirt is.","All-in-all I liked the dress, but it isnt one that I loved or even one that I am sure Id rent again.","It can be worn with a normal bra, and even has bra snaps to hold your straps in place, which was nice."
"6.0","I ordered this blazer as a fun pop of excitement to wear at my job on my birthday.","This blazer ran a lot smaller than expected and did not look like it did on the model.","The picture made it look very professional and elegant while still being quirky.","The reality was that it made me look like I was going out on the town, rather than teaching.","It was still a very beautiful piece, I just found it to be uncomfortable, too small, and not the style I hoped it to be."
"6.0","This dress could be worn without a bra, or with a stick-on Nubra.","Strapless bra will show in the open back.","Also, beware back cleavage if you have extra flesh on your back.","I didnt wear the dress, as I found it not very flattering.","Its nicely made, the boning around the waist and reaching up right under the bust makes it possible to wear without a bra, if youre not too busty.","Its definitely a pinky/blue red.","Not a warm red."
"6.0","The waist is extremely tight, but if I had gone up a size, the bust would have been too big and the dress too long.","Pockets were amazing and the material gave a lovely shimmer, so it was formal enough for  a gala type event."
"6.0","The top fit fine, but the bottom was a bit to poufy.","Im an hourglass shape and I didnt find this particularly flattering.","paired it with a blazer and heels for work."
"6.0","I rented this dress to attend an evening wedding.","The dress is cute, but the color was a little bit brighter pink than I was expecting.","The color was not me so I did not end up wearing the dress.","Note - you need to wear a strapless bra with the dress."
"6.0","Cute sweater but I should have gotten a medium or maybe even a small.","I was swimming in it and normally I wear a large."
"6.0","Absolutely beautiful perfectly tailored dress, however, I have never worn something as uncomfortable.","Grabbing a drink and sipping it was not even easy.","In addition, the dress has zero give, so def size up if you want to be able to breath, I think I would have been much better in a medium though, but the small hugged everything perfectly and creates a very nice silhouette.","Very classy, great for any type of body, size up for sure if you are on the bustier side, the rib cage can get very tight.","Difficult to zip up without help, I found the zipper very hard on he mid section.","The dress is one of a kind, if you want to stand out just go for it."
"6.0","The color was amazing - got several compliments on the cobalt blue!","The fit was oversized and boxy.","If thats what youre going for, youll love this vest!","I wish it was more fitted and feminine around the waist personally."
"6.0","This dress fit very true to size, it looked great in the front but made me look kind of boxy from the back because of the pleating.","I ended up not wearing this dress."
"6.0","I didnt wear this dress, but I tried it on.","The material is a very thick spandexy fabric, it made the dress very warm.","Other than being tight, the dress didnt have much sex appeal on me, the cut outs are very small.","The sleeves seemed very long too."
"6.0","I would have given this dress 5 stars----but one thing held me back: The boning in the corset was coming out and poking my stomach!","It was so painful.","The dress fit very well and looked amazing, but it was just uncomfortable.","If the boning was fixed, this would be a perfect outfit!"
"6.0","It is a trapeze dress - lots of extra fabric to swing around!","Unfortunately, it made me look like I had gained 50 pounds / looked too heavy on me (its also a little long), so I returned it without wearing it."
"6.0","The fit was a bit loose.","I did not like the fact that even the slightest but of sweat would show up under your arms so if youre going to get it plan on a cold area maybe.","Otherwise its a really elegant and classy dress that makes a statement!"
"6.0","Unfortunately, I ordered a size up (6) & it was too large in the bust area for me.","I was unable to wear this.","I would definitely order the smaller size for another time!","!"
"6.0","The size is true.","However, a little too short for a formal wedding.","I am 55 and you could easily see my behind if i bent down a little."
"6.0","Im typically a size 4 but since this had no stretch (and I have hips), I opted for the 6.","Fit well, but overall it was a bit matronly.","Felt like my mother wearing it.","Ended up opting for a different dress.","Too safe for me."
"6.0","The top attaches only in the front, leaving the back to flow or hang straight down, and keeps you cool.","The bottom half is stretchy materials, so you have stomach pouch like me, it will be slightly visibleOverall, I liked the dress"
"6.0","Super cute dress.","I looked at the other reviews, and did size up- it does run small on the top.","The skirt does poof out more than in the picture.","It was SO short though, so much so I could not wear this for the family party I had selected it for.","I am 56 but have long legs and this was short on me.","Would work well for someone shorter, or without longer legs."
"6.0","This blouse has a beautiful  design and color...BUT!!!","and is a huge BUT... will make you look at least 10 pounds heavier!!","no kidding!","its shape is super boxy and not flattering at all..."
"6.0","I loved the look and color of the dress, unfortunately did not wear it as the whole side breasts were showing.","It has a weird see through mesh on under the arms."
"6.0","nice fabric but this is more of a tomato red (with orange) than a true red.","you need a tan to wear this color.","it is also very short!"
"6.0","The 4 fit, usually a size 2.","However, it was not a good cut for my body.","Needs a woman with a waist and some curves.","Beautiful fabric, though, and I loved the top part!"
"6.0","I found this dress to be just okay.","It fit well, was comfortable, mostly held things in in the right places.","But otherwise, there wasnt anything particularly memorable about it, at least on me."
"6.0","I suggest pulling the front of the dressdown so that the back lies flat.","Goes great with gold accesories."
"6.0","The dress is beautiful and I wish it had worked!","It fits true to size.","I did not wear it because it was way too short-waisted for me, and the waist hit on my ribs, and didnt look good."
"6.0","From the front I loved the way this looked on me, but I had the bottom-of-zipper  bump that some other reviews mentioned.","Kind of  resembled a tail  so not what I was going for given the party was more of a standing one.","I only tried one size via Unlimited  -- which I found TTS -- but others said sizing up helped the tail.","I may try that and hope its not too much fabric elsewhere."
"6.0","I read a few reviews that also stated that the straps were too big and were falling off the shoulders...","I thought that since my chest is on the larger side... this wouldnt be a problem.","However, the straps were big and definitely were falling off.","Luckily, my sister was able to pin the straps and the dress looked great!","I got a lot of compliments and do not regret the rental (just glad my sister was there to save the day!",")."
"6.0","Pros: very stretchy, so can fit a variety of shapes, while holding the pattern well.","Stays on shoulders well.","Designs at base and arms were lovely.","Cons: No wow!","factor.","Was too short for me (Im 59 and hoped the stretchy part would hit below my knee as it did in the model, but came more above my knee, making this look less dramatic - would be great for someone under 56) Did not hold me in despite all the stretch, so it really wasnt flattering, even with a solid pair of spanx."
"6.0","I worn this dress for a semi formal dinner dance fundraiser for my kids school.","I wish I had listened to the other reviewers who warned about the zipper.","When I first tried to on I had just a second before I needed to pick my kids up at school and head to swim lessons.","The zipper got stuck and I had a panic moment where I thought I would have to be the best dressed mom at the pool.","Because of the tricky zipper and tight fit on top I would suggest getting the next size up as the back up.","It was also longer than I thought it would be, but I am only 53.","All this being said, I like the dress.","It was fun and flirty and I liked the pockets.","It arrived in great shape and I didnt have to steam it.","I would use Rent the Runway again.","Very easy and convenient!"
"6.0","The black part of the dress is stretchy and on me it did tend to ride up but I am tall so it wouldnt have been as annoying if it was a little longer to begin with.","Other reviewers mention that black material seemed cheap which I agree with but didnt think that it was very noticeable because its black.","The top is very pretty and overall I liked the look at lot."
"6.0","I eyed this dress for a while before I happened upon an event I could wear it to.","The color is beautiful, and I liked the scalloping around the bustline, but the cut wasnt all that flattering.","I tried on two sizes (6, which I usually wear, and 8).","While they both fit fine, the 8 didnt suffocate my boobs as much and gave more flattering cleavage.","Even with a belt, the dress doesnt provide much shape."
"6.0","The back area was awkwardly long.","It was as if the length of the dress was shortened to fit my height while maintaining the top area in tact.","Thus, I had at least three to four inches of fabric scrunched in the back while the rest of the dress fit perfectly around my bust, waist and hips.","I would recommend no show underwear.","I am a 32 J.","Unfortunately, I cannot wear this dress without underwear and without it becoming visible.","I would totally recommend this dress with someone with less of a bust."
"6.0","This dress overall is so beautiful in the picture!","When I tried it on however, it was small in the hips and was so unflattering while the top hung off of me.","For reference I am 52 34D, 145 lbs and normally a size 8 in dresses.","Just not for my body type."
"6.0","I got this dress as the one I hoped to wear since the color is FANTASTIC and it would have been perfect if they had had the Long version available for me.","At 510 I take no chances.","I probably could have gotten away with this one, but the Long version I had ordered in red had that extra length so that a floor length gown was actually on the ground."
"6.0","This dress is kind of sized odd.","Im usually a size 6 In dresses.","The size 6 skirt part fit great in this dress, but the top was large and kept falling off.","The 4 fit great up top but was a little shorter/snug on bottom.","Keep in mind, I have extremely broad shoulders / athletic build...","So I was surprised the 6 didnt fit up top.","I ended up going with the 4.","Regardless, this was a great dress and I got tons of compliments.","Material is extremely stretchy, not stiff like I thought it would be from the model picture"
"6.0","Just was too tight across the chest"
"6.0","It is possible I should have sized down, but I wanted to leave enough room for my athletic thighs (and cute, but big butt!)","Unfortunately, it left too much room from my non-existent chest.","I recommend this one for someone over 53 and with a small to full B or more.","Just want to make sure you fill all the important parts out.... especially the top since it is lined/padded on the inside and will be pointy if you dont."
"6.0","Fabric has no structure; good if you need some stretch.","Everything seemed to fit ok except the waist, which was very loose on me.","The shoulders/arms were a little snug, but nothing unbearable or unwearable.","I could see this dress being perfect for someone who is tall and thin or pregnant."
"6.0","This dress runs a large.","I could have tried the 14 possibly and Im usually a 16/18.","It was just big and unflattering, but this was a back up dress that was sent to me and I wanted to be safe and ordered the 18.","Should have asked for the 16 as well.","I just dont think the dress would have looked good on me either way, but the color was very pretty!"
"6.0","Unless youre thin which Im not, the dress is too busy and makes you look unflattering."
"6.0","beautiful pattern.","thick top.","pretty skirt.","runs large and was unflattering"
"6.0","Cant see the entire vest, but its very square and has no tailoring to it.","Its really high quality and looks amazing, but its more for women who are straight rather than curvy - unless you wear it with a sweater... then shape doesnt matter.","Would rent again, but in the fall."
"6.0","Wore this dress to a wedding.","Its January in Wisconsin so, brrr.","This dress was perfect though!","I am 52, bewten a size 4 and 6 and the small was perfect.","The shape holds up for a few hours, but not for many hours (more on that later).","The merino wool material is quite thick but it doesnt look or feel that way.","It is super stretchy (more on that later) and fit beautifully.","Now ladies, if you have a little poochy tummy from winter hibernation or babies or whatever, no worries.","The wrap-action of the dress does a great job of hiding some of that.","Its a very classy and elegant dress, great for weddings AND funerals or really any event.","Its great for a smart casual event.","So, I was really, really happy with the dress when I first tried it on.","And I was very happy with it when I put it on for the event.","A few hours in to the day and some sitting later, I found that the dress was losing its snug fit and shape quickly.","By the end of evening, it was bunchy, especially where it had stretched around my booty from sitting and the edges all around were folding up and all in all, I felt pretty sloppy.","I think I would rent this dress again for a short evening out."
"6.0","Im a proportionate 54 and these pants hit the top of my foot.","They definitely were not cropped on me like they were on the model.","These are high-waisted pants.","The size 2 fit true to size around the waist, although they were snug around the thigh.","The fit was not comfortable, so I didnt end up wearing them."
"6.0","I love the color and style of the lace on this dress.","It really is beautiful and well made.","There are several layers of lining, which gives the dress a little poof, without being too puffy.","I also loved the fit and flare style of the dress which is flattering on my body type.","I normally wear an 18 or 20 but read reviews that this dress ran small and I have heavyset arms, so I ordered the 20 and 22.","Im glad that I ordered a size up.","The 20 was so tight that I couldnt zip it around my chest (Im a 40 DD) and it was extraordinarily tight on my arms.","The larger size was still fairly tight on my arms but very comfortable to roomy elsewhere.","The length was a little on the short side.","I wouldve been more comfortable if it was maybe 2 inches longer.","I had read reviews that it was short, but figured that Im on the short side, so itd be okay.","Its not an inappropriate length, but again, just wish it was ever so slightly longer.","Overall, if I was going to purchase a dress in the store, I wouldve moved on from this one, but I felt like it was fine for the occasion."
"6.0","The dress was fun, but I was glad to only wear it once.","It was a little shorter than I wanted, and the pattern on the rear end was poorly placed.","My husband told me that it made my butt look big.","That said, I received lots of compliments and definitely  had a good time wearing it."
"6.0","The dress is perfect for a tropical vacation.","Im only giving it 3 stars because it ran very large.","Instead of a sexy, sunkissed look, I felt like a mom.","I attempted to use fashion tape to make it shorter but that was a complete fail.","I would rent again but in a smaller size."
"6.0","The dress was very pretty, but I didnt wear it to the wedding I had gotten it for.","It was too long on me...Im 54 and it hit well below my knee.","It fit well except it was a little loose at my waist, so was not flattering on me as I looked straight with no curves.","I felt that the showing under slip is a bit short for someone my age.","It would look great if you are taller, younger and have more curves.","Story of my life!"
"6.0","Skirt is fun and looks good especially from the side bu the thick material made it borderline impossible to walk normally.","Make sure to wear it with something very fitted on top."
"6.0","I rented this for a cocktail party for work and unfortunately, the sleeves were too snug.","The dress fit well everywhere else.","But ultimately I didnt wear because I was too uncomfortable in the sleeves."
"6.0","The jacket runs large I ordered a small and wore a heavy sweater underneath.","I should have ordered the xs!"
"6.0","I ordered the OP with the OR as backup, They ended up not having the OP available and only mailed me the OR.....which was a little big and VERY long on my 52 frame.","They offered to overnight me another dress, but all  other dresses were OR and I was worried theyd all be as long.","Along with the fact that none of the styles I liked were available even in OR.","So I frantically did last minute shoe shopping for 4+ inch platforms, making the dress only about 2 inches to long on me.","I had to hold the dress up all night long and tripped on it twice.","I have had friends use renttherunway before and rave about it, but I was pretty disappointed for my big night."
"6.0","Its a basic blazer as pictured.","It has a boxy wide fit.","The sleeves fall a couple inches above my wrists, so I push up the sleeves when I wear it.","If I leave the sleeves long I feel like Im wearing my little brothers Jacket.","I wore it with a lace dress and booties and then again with jeans, a shiny grey t-shirt and a fuzzy scarf.","The back is cropped so I like wearing it with a longer blouse that flows down the back."
"6.0","Since i have no waist, it the back opening pulled and looked awkward.","Color was tomato soup!","Dress has no stretch!","for reference I am 58  130# 36C with 32 waist and 37 hips"
"6.0","This dress was gorgeous.","And it fits like a glove - makes you feel glamorous and slim.","Unfortunately, my particular dress had seen better days and the back lining was coming undone from the zipper, making it not possible to close or wear.","Although I would have loved to wear the dress, thanks to RTR and their customer service team for refunding the order!"
"6.0","Great jumper but all the hooks can be a pain when going to the bathroom!"
"6.0","Was a bit too big on the waist."
"6.0","I ended up wearing a different dress but this dress was very nice as well !","The material was thick and good quality.","However, not much room to grow in the dress as its true to size and the zipper is on the side.","Also, the bottom portion of the dress is a lot puffier and bigger than in photos."
"6.0","I wish this dress came in a 12.","It doesnt have any stretch so a true size would be necessary, but I am a 14.","14w was one or two sizes too large.","It was a shame because I loved the dress.","For a taller woman it hit at the right point below the knee.","Loved it, but couldnt wear it."
"6.0","The 4R (my normal size) fit like a glove, however, it was EXTREMELY SHORT!","Im only 54 so the fact that it was at my ankles was shocking and there was no way I could wear heels.","It was rather disappointing.","Fortunately, I got the 6 as a backup and good thing, it was slightly longer, at least enough for heels but it was loose--fine enough.","The dress was beautiful but I noticed there was a bit of wear on it.","The details on the dress were coming up and had a lot of frayed white tips.","On a black/gold dress it was noticeable up close.","It was beautiful, comfortable and simplistic but had some noticeable miles on it."
"6.0","It was PERFECT for the event.","Blingy but not tacky and if youre curvy the cut of this dress is FABULOUS!","The only thing I will say about the cut was that it gaped a bit around my ribcage Unless I pulled it down.","I think, because it fit in the chest and was a little small in the hips but was also too big in the waist.","But its stretchy so it still looked killer...","I wish I owned this dress.","FYI: some of the beading had come undone but not enough for anyone to notice during one night.","So check out your dress when you rent.","Especially if you have a daytime event."
"6.0","really big and baggy"
"6.0","This top is a cute fabrication I like the combination of the solid and pinstripes it is full and loose, my major problem with this top is when I sat down the straps would stick up or fall over at strange angles and I had as tight as I could make it and its still just didnt work right.","I found myself constantly pulling it down to keep the straps looking normal."
"6.0","Couldnt get the odd cut to work on my figure, which is a shame because the fabric and tailoring are of high quality.","I think on a shorter woman it would be a better fit."
"6.0","This dress was beautiful, however, I am a 34H and the support even with a strapless bra was not enough."
"6.0","If 3.5 stars was an option, I would give it that instead of just a 3 for these reasons: Pros: 1) Material looks nice2) Fit and Flare style is perfect for pear shaped bodies3) Long Sleeves is great for outdoor fall wedding4) Appropriate Length (Im 58)5) Received several complimentsCons: 1) Very little stretch in the top part (or at all).","2) I normally can wear size 4 in this fit and flare style since Im pear shaped - and I DID wear the size 4, however it was really tight.","The size 6 was also tight and I would have worn the 6, but there were two issues with the size 6 dress that I received: the bottom skirt part would not lay correctly and was awkwardly poofy and looked like it had been laying in a pile for days.","I tried ironing/steaming it, but it would still not lay right.","The second issue was the seams had fallen on on BOTH of the bottom part of the sleeves, so it did not look good.","3) I could have worn the 8 probably - so size up, ladies!","4) Not sure it was worth the $100 rental given all of these issues."
"6.0","This dress was pretty, but too short for the event I wanted to wear it to.","Im 60, and ordered sizes 8 and 10.","10 was a little longer, but way too loose on the top.","Ended up returning both."
"6.0","Rented a size 6 based on the other reviews.","Im 53, 125lbs (at my highest), 36C.","While this dress was super cute (husband loved it), and the silk was light and flowy, it was way too restricting in the torso and back.","I couldnt raise my arms in it (had to get help zipping it up because of that).","But the worst was that I felt like I had a wide belt pulled tight across my ribcage, couldnt breathe deeply.","I didnt wear it to work, because I dont think I could have lasted more than 20 Minutes in it.","A size 8 would likely be better, but my guess is that it would take a 10 to make it comfortable enough to wear all day.","But a 10 would be ridiculously large everywhere else.","As it was, the sleeves on the 6 were a tad long.","This dress probably is best for straight and narrow body types, who have really small ribcages.","Had high hopes based on the great reviews.",":-("
"6.0","It is a bit golder than in the picture and as a result can look a bit over the top depending on where you are wearing it"
"6.0","Not for those with larger breast.","And you really need a small waist"
"6.0","This dress is was beautiful and was good length for my 5 foot body.","I did not end up wearing this dress but swapped it out for another dress.","I wanted to say that RTRs customer service when I swapped out the dress was great.","They were patient with me and were so helpful.","Its reassuring to know that if something did not work out, RTR is very good to its customers."
"6.0","This dress is so well made, really cool details that makes it more than just your everyday black dress.","Unfortunately, it really is very big.","I usually wear a 6, ordered a 4, and it was still way too big.","Trying again in a smaller size."
"6.0","Even for a loose fit, I felt the top ran very large.","I ordered an XS and it was just too big to wear.","Order way down and it could make a cute outfit."
"6.0","n/a"
"6.0","Didnt even end up wearing it.","Ran VERY tight.","I tried to wear this to a formal professional event but this was way too sexy.","Would be great for a night out or a wedding."
"6.0","I wore this to the Country Music Awards in Vegas.","I am 57 and wore 2-3 inch heels and still felt it was a little too long.","It worked out great though.","The only thing i didnt like about the dress is that the material gave me a rash under my arms."
"6.0","This dress was so pretty and fit perfectly.","Its very well-made.","The peach color is pretty, but unfortunately, since the lace overlay is white, if youre several feet away, it looks like youre wearing a white lace dress.","I just didnt feel comfortable wearing it to a wedding so I didnt wear this and had to choose something from my closet instead."
"6.0","I really love the pattern and the vibe of the dress.","The bow in the back was a huge hit at the wedding and was a nice thickness of fabric for a more brisk event (our temp was 60 degrees ).","Tricky parts of the dress are the straps and the hips.","He strapless look so nice when they hit where they do in the picture but moving around rides them up and you lose a little bit of the sophistication of the dress.","I have larger hips and butt so the six was a little snug in that area but when I went up to the eight I lost the definition of my waist so I opted for the snug butt and toned down the dancing.","Definitely a good dress for a more chill event"
"6.0","This jumpsuit is not for those who have a long torso - or a D cup chest!","I never wore it.","Very disappointed."
"6.0","Loved the design, it was a cute, casual dress.","The lining on the inside is very small, though.","Quite annoying.","It seems like a whole size smaller than the dress.","It kept riding up which got annoying.","Wouldnt rent again."
"6.0","The dress was longer than I expected - Im 59 and it hit much lower on my leg than on the model.","The fabric is also thick and has a lot of volume, so at first it was a bit overwhelming.","It looked better once I had heels on, and I did get stopped and complimented on it by another guest.","The skirt has a lot of volume, and creates a great shape."
"6.0","This dress photographs really well, but Id go with the smaller size.","For some reason the way the chest meets the waist makes you look a little matronly.","I also had to pin my bra down in the back of the dress so it wouldnt show.","It wasnt my favorite rental, but it worked well for the black tie wedding I attended.","Its definitely a head turner."
"6.0","I rented this for a wedding but didnt end up wearing it.","I normally wear a size 2 (comfortably) in all other pieces Ive rented, but this one was VERY tight.","The black band under the bust has no give, and it was uncomfortably tight around my rib cage.","The neck lace also goes up very high and was rubbing against my collar bone.","In the 5 minutes I was trying it on for, I already had red marks around my neck from the lace rubbing on it.","I dont know if it was just too tight, or if the lace itself.","Overall, the dress is very pretty, and I am sad it didnt work out."
"6.0","I am a very petite person and usually some size 0s dont always work for me.","This dress was a little bit big in the waist and top.","I saw that there were spots for straps to be added for this dress.","I didnt have any black straps or else I would have used them.","It would have been nice if RTR had sent them with the dress."
"6.0","Too boxy and conservative for my taste.","It does hide a multitude of figure issues such as tummy and thigh as it is not a form fitting dress.","Also feel the dress did not feel or look expensive.","Runs big, size down."
"6.0","Its so pretty, but it is very short and if youre have a larger butt and thighs it doesnt cover much.","That said, I was in Vegas so I wore it anyway to see Britney Spears and I loved it.","Probably wouldnt wear it at home though."
"6.0","Big for me - would be better on a taller person I think"
"6.0","The dress was gorgeous - comfortable, fit well, super cute.","However, please be aware that the zipper in the back of the dress runs the full length of the dress.","I didnt give this much thought, but later in the evening, the zipper split and my rear was exposed.","Fortunately, a friend pointed this out immediately to me and I was able to cover up with my coat.","The dress wasnt too tight, I wore my normal size, and I wasnt doing anything strenuous, so there wasnt any uncommon stress being placed on the zipper.","I didnt see anyone else mention this in their reviews, so I guess I was the unfortunate one.","If you do rent this dress, I recommend wearing a slip in case this does happen again!","I have rented from RTR many times (20+) and this is the first time I have had an issue with a dress being unwearable."
"6.0","It is really made for someone with a long torso.","If you are full figured, it may not work."
"6.0","Not short enough to be cropped or long enough to be ok without constant tugging down"
"6.0","I needed fashion tape to keep the back from slipping.","It was pretty short, which was fine since Im 54.","Probably to short for those taller."
"6.0","Unfortunately, I couldnt receive my original dress, so the stylist suggested this one.","I was pretty hesitant at first, but decided to wear it because I had nothing else for my daytime graduation fair of some sort.","The back is definitely the best part of the dress.","The front is iffy- Im not sure it was the most flattering.","I also had to consistently keep pulling it down, because it would ride up, especially in the heat.","Overall Id prob give it a 3.5-4.","I wouldnt order it again, but I didnt mind wearing it also.","I did receive a lot of compliments on the water color dress."
"6.0","This dress was gorgeous but it fit a bit small and the cross pieces on the back wouldnt lay flat.","I think a 2 would have been too large since this was just barely too snug all around."
"6.0","I wore this for my bday night out with a cream belt.","For me, belting was a must as the romper does not offer much shape.","It wasnt itchy and the sequins did not catch onto other things.","It was cute and festive."
"6.0","I think this dress is best suited for the weekend (not work) and I also would say a pretty casual setting is best."
"6.0","The dress is very comfortable and very flattering on top.","My only issue with the dress is that the skirt was fuller than I had anticipated which lead to a difficult time of getting the pleats to lay flat."
"6.0","Pros - beautiful colors, nicely madeCons - runs large and looked large on me.","Not a fan of how it fit.","May work better for others."
"6.0","This was a fun dress I rented for my Vegas trip, but I didnt end up wearing it (I did a rent one get three deal).","It was a bit tight and short, and I felt self-conscious in it because it felt overly sexy.","I think if there was a larger size (XL) available, I wouldve been super happy with it.","Also, the zipper tends to get stuck in the back fairly easily."
"6.0","It was more of a daytime dress than evening dress.","The fabric did not feel very luxurious or expensive.","The cut out sleeves and lace are a nice detail but the pattern and general feel of this dress just did not make it feel special.","Its a great little day time dress though."
"6.0","I loved the look of this dress, but the open back made it difficult to wear comfortably.","I would recommend being prepared with plenty of fashion tape, because one wrong move on the dance floor and that dress was slipping right off.","I think this might be better for a sit down event where you dont plan to move as much.","Nonetheless, it was a beautiful dress and I received many compliments on it!"
"6.0","There is beading on the neckline which I didnt realize and really didnt like, ended up not wearing"
"6.0","Im somewhere between a Small and Medium usually.","The small I didnt even try on because there is no way it was fitting.","The Medium was fine, but just ok for me.","The shirt is cut pretty low, making it a little risque for a conservative office.","The length is nice, but I felt like the top wrinkled more than it should.","All in all it stands out and is flattering for a date or dinner out with friends."
"6.0","I wanted to love this!","The color is fabulous, the length was right...but I put it on and it made me look like I had the longest crotch in the world.","I showed my husband, who said I looked like an 80s mom about to hand out juice boxes, which was certainly not the look I was going for.","I guess I just dont have the body type for this jumpsuit; I think women of all sizes can wear this, but it definitely accentuates a curvy belly."
"6.0","Wore this for my birthday mimosa crawl, its cute and very trendy so i would only wear it once.","its a little loose fitting and way lower cut than you think itll be.","It can be a little clunky esp if youre not a petite person, was cute for the one occasion."
"6.0","I love the color and the lace on this dress.","However, the fabric doesn t really have any give or weight to help it lay nicely.","When I was standing straight up it looked great.","Lean forward or sit down and it bunched up around the waist making it look like I had a belly or even a baby bump.","That was mortifying and bothered me a lot.","Im not the skinniest person so I definitely dont want to wear a dress that makes me look bigger."
"6.0","The fit was off for me - i should have went one size up because the top seemed really loose while the bottom was almost too small.","I think the 42 would have laid properly...","BUT the material is GORGEOUS and I just love the way it looks in general when not on my body,"
"6.0","The item ran small in the bust and did not fit."
"6.0","This dress is cute and well-made, but runs very large.","Elizabeth & James items usually fit me perfectly in an XS or 0, but the waist on this one was pretty gigantic.","I was able to wear it cinched with an obi belt, but this did make it a bit rumply in the midsection.","Id suggest ordering one size down if you are not an XS already."
"6.0","I ordered a Medium even though I am usually a 4 because I read reviews on this brand elsewhere and it apparently ran small.","The M fit like an 8 (as it should).","The dress was way too big to tell how it looked but it looks like a gorgeous dress on the hangar.","I wish I ordered the Small, I would have loved to have worn it!!","!"
"6.0","6 was snug in the legs/butt but 8 was loose up top.","Went with the 8, but ended up fidgeting with the top of the dress a lot."
"6.0","I did not wear the dress.","My advice would be to order your size and the next size up.","Fashion tape for the neckline would have been needed to keep the upper bodice from showing my strapless bra.","It is a beautiful dress.","The color is gorgeous.","I just felt awkward about the neckline, but others may like it better than me."
"6.0","This dress is absolutely precious BUT for someone like me who is 51 with longer legs, a short torso, and proportionally sized chest, this dress was not ideal for my body type.","Wish it would have fit better but just had to try it!","!"
"6.0","The fit was a little weird.","I have an athletic build.","It was tight through the hips/butt, so the fabric getting caught there almost made it look like I have a pooch at my tummy because it didnt fall straight down.","BUT the 8 was WAY too big, so I just dealt with the 6 and got tons of compliments.","The cape is really elegant and added just enough of a statement.","The red is a beautiful red, not orangey and looked good even on my winter skin color.","I think in the future, I will steer clear of renting this brand because its just not made right for my build off the rack."
"6.0","The dress was beautiful.","But my breast are a 40DD.","i could not get the dress zipped up!","Too bad!"
"6.0","Im petite, but have an athletic build.","This probably does run true to size, but I typically order up a size when in doubt.","The shirt was a little loose on me.","The tails (I dont know what to call them) are pretty long and sort of weigh you down.","I ended up tying them in front and to the side.","I wore it out to dinner.","I definitely didnt love it, but it was passable for an evening out."
"6.0","I wore this dress for my anniversary and it was great!","I originally got it because it looked like the same cut as Slate & Willows very similar dress the Madeline Sheath.","For others who think the same thing, the Madeline Sheath dress is a better dress due to the material.","This dress isnt the same material, the material is instead more of a tight body fitting spandex rayon material that hugs your body.","It wasnt too unflattering because of the pattern on the dress and didnt call too much attention to spots you dont want people noticing.","The drop open back is still stunning and a show stopper, however because I have wide hips and because of the material, the bottom kept riding up.","If have to constantly pull it down when walking to and from places.","Still had a great time wearing the dress though.","The pattern is amazing and the back is gorgeous."
"6.0","Rented this for NYE in Manhattan for a Black Tie gathering.","I loved the neckline, which showed off my athletic shoulders.","Dress was a bit heavy overall, but lined well.","I would rent from Erin Featherston again, love her looks!"
"6.0","I rented this dress for an after holiday party.","It was incredibly short, and Im 52!","I have a booty and I could not even bend over with completely exposing myself so I had to wear a black pencil skirt underneath.","Everyone loved the dress with the open back, but I would never wear it without the pencil skirt underneath.","This dress is great for a special occasion or holiday.","I paired it with red heels and silver jewelry.","Not my favorite dress but always great customer service by RTR."
"6.0","I find Theory to run small so I sized up and it looked really big on me.","Style is meant to be over sized but I recommend sizing down and it will still fit.","Will eventually rent again in the smaller size."
"6.0","Ended up wearing a different dress.","Also, if you have any pudge in the middle it might give you a little bit of a maternity look :/Beautiful design for the petite!"
"6.0","Very pretty dress.","Wool material - too hot for summer/night out.","Shows too much cleavage if you have bigger breasts."
"6.0","Wore it with dark jeans.","Color is great.","Sweater is stiffer than expected but still easy to wear.","Fits large and sleeves are long (I have very long arms) and can be folded up if needed."
"6.0","Pros:  Sparkly and pretty from afarCons:  The material is scratchy and not ideal for a date.","It is very rough to the touch (which I guess is to be expected when sparkle is involved).","Not my personal style.","HOWEVER, with that said, I would rent it for New Years Eve possibly or a girls weekend.","Other:  It is a pretty dress, just didnt fall on my body correctly.","The color is more black and gold in person (On my computer it appears an olive and gold)."
"6.0","This dress is gorgeous but the shoulder straps are way too long and not adjustable so it would have sagged and shown a lot of cleavage on me (I am 55 and ordered the XSR).","It would probably work if you are taller or have wider shoulders."
"6.0","I originally ordered the small but last minute it was out of stock and was shipped the medium.","It was definitely a little too big but other than that, it was really fun wearing.","People loved it and ti really stood out as it reflected light from every direction!","It was my first time ordering from RTR and everything worked out fine.","Very simple and easy!"
"6.0","The material is nice.","The sweater has a cool vibe.","I felt like it made me look a little frumpy in the boob area the way the front wraps and meets.","I liked it but happy I could rent it and not own it."
"6.0","This dress was a backup dress sent to me.","The material is nice and thick and the color is a bright cobalt blue.","I didnt think that the pattern was necessarily very flattering on my body, however.","Ended up wearing my first choice anyways."
"6.0","I liked the dress but it was very heavy.","It did not flatter my figure the way I had hoped."
"6.0","The waist was oversized - it just fell way below my hips."
"6.0","Wore this to work even though it was a little small for me (I usually wear a 2).","It was a bit too short in the front and felt like I had to suck in my stomach all day"
"6.0","Gorgeous color beautiful fabric... would love to have worn!"
"6.0","Fit extremely well / true to size except the sleeves were slightly long and bell-shaped so had to be careful while eating.","Otherwise this was a very cute pick for my friends wedding goodbye brunch."
"6.0","I should have listened to the reviews.","You need to have either no bust at all in order to have a very long and elegant neck line, or have enough of a bust to give you cleavage to fill the neck line.","Anything in between doesnt fill the cups properly, which creates this effect of looking really wide.","Its a shame, because the color was beautiful and the length was perfect.","I ended up not wearing this dress."
"6.0"," The dress is cute and pretty casual.","Perfect for a bbq or garden party.","However,  i warn you, get the size up!","I am generally between a size 0 and 2, there was no way this dress would even zipper on the 0, and if was a tight fit in the 2.","I was planning on wearing the dress for my birthday dinner and for drinks after.","But,  after a steak dinner,  the dress was feeling waaaaay too tight,  and I had to change!"
"6.0","Pretty long and weighted down.","Love the cute sleeves.","Didnt end up wearing."
"6.0","Im 54 and the 4R came to my ankle.","The 2R was my only option for a backup and it was a little shorter.","But I liked the full length pant vs the cropped look on the model.","The neckline was little low cut but not too bad.","It gave it a little sex appeal in an otherwise conservative piece, but I pinned it anyway to minimize the cleavage since I was going to a baptism."
"6.0","This dress was very constricting and tight all over with no stretch to it at all.","I did not wear it."
"6.0","The color was great and the dress fit like a gem but the wiring in the bust was sticking out, making it uncomfortable to wear throughout the night."
"6.0","This was my backup dress and I wound up not wearing it.","It was fine and I would have worn it if it was my only option, but it just didnt really stand out as special on me for some reason.","It also fell a couple inches longer on me than I wouldve liked."
"6.0","Fits true to size (size 4).","Im 52, and this dress hits below the knees (a bit too long).","Pros: Loved the laser cut-outs, it makes this dress so original.","The fabric doesnt wrinkle easily either.","Cons: You would need a special bra for this or really good tape/pasties."
"6.0","Rented this for a food and wine event.","I was surprised and how easy it was to move around in and how well it fit.","With the sequins, I was expecting it to be stiff, but it wasnt at all and is really flattering on an hourglass figure.","However, it was very scratchy, so I probably wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","Unfortunately this dress is for all the tall ladies.","I am 54 and even in 4 inch heels there was just no way to make this work even with fashion hem tape.","This was a sad return for me."
"6.0","This top is beautiful because of the floral pattern and movement of the ruffles.","However, it does not lay straight down on the waist area like the pictures show on the site.","The bottom of the top flares out significantly.","This top is definitely bump friendly for anyone that may be preggers.","If you prefer a slim appearance this is not the top for you."
"6.0","I rented this through Unlimited, and picked the large size because thats usually what I wear in knit pencil skirts like this.","However, I think it runs very large - I could have easily sized down to a M, and I normally wear a size 8-10.","It was also a little longer than I expected; Im 52, and if I wore it on my waist then it came down to my mid-calf - I would have had to pull it up to my bust just to have the length right, which threw the fit off.","The material is also a thicker knit than I expected - I think this will be good for colder weather, maybe with boots, but for a summer skirt its just too heavy.","Taller women will have better luck with this piece."
"6.0","Being only 51,  my cleavage starts pretty soon.","For my comfort level, I dont show cleavage.","This showed just a bit of cleavage so I couldnt pull it off and decided not to wear it.","Otherwise, if youre okay with some cleavage, this is a nice sexy top."
"6.0","The color and neckline are amazing but it was insanely too small.","I typically wear a 0-2 but I would probably try a 4 in this if I ordered it again.","I couldnt even get close to zipping it and the bottom was so tight there was no way you could walk normal or sit down."
"6.0","This is a lovely dress.","The color is beautiful and the sequins fun.","I have an hourglass figure and on me the ruching draped across my thin waist in a way that made it look like I was hiding a pregnancy.","On someone with something to hide in that section it would probably work very well as it is a stretchy material."
"6.0","I got this for a White Party with my Unlimited Subscription but could not wear it because the slip is super small.","It was both tight and short.","The dress itself for great and the material was thick and lovely.","I could have possibly went and bought a slip to wear underneath but just didnt have time."
"6.0","The dress actually fit ok, I think my overall issue was with the length.","I am 56 and it barely hit my ankles so that just made it ill-fitting.","Material is great though, very breathable, especially nice in the summer time!","I would say though that the dress is definitely made for a curvy body, and someone that is full chested."
"6.0","Luckily, the fabric is very forgiving.","Im usually a size 8.","I ordered the Large and it was still a big tight in places.","I wore it anyway b/c the pattern and fabric hid the trouble spots nicely.","Im actually a 32DDD and it fit nicely in the chest.","The hips/butt area were too tight.","Overall, I did like the dress, but wont rent again b/c of the size issues."
"6.0","I ordered this as my back-up dress.","It is beautiful--the color is amazing and the fabric is lovely.","The long was REALLY long--too long to wear.","I am 59 and had 3 inch heels and the skirt dragged on the ground.","I felt lucky the first dress I chose fit well as I could not have worn this.","There was a woman at the event I attended (a much younger woman than I!)","who was wearing this dress in red.","She looked amazing."
"6.0","The arms were a little tight but still fit well.","I ordered the 0 and 2 and went with the 0 because the waist and butt area is bigger and I wanted it to be a little more fitted.","The fabric feels a little weird - almost like a thick lab coat.","Everyone was very complementary  of the dress but the feel of it was not my favorite.","Good for a colder weather party."
"6.0","The dress was the perfect option for my January engagement party!","My only issue with it was that the sleeves were a bit too big - it would have needed some alterations to fit snugly on my arms and look the way it did on the model.","Otherwise, I loved it and got a ton of compliments!"
"6.0","fit ok- boxy as expected, little itchy on parts but most lined with comfortable sweatshirt like material, thick"
"6.0","I rented for my engagement photos, but decided against wearing it.","There was TOO much side boob action."
"6.0","Fabric is in good conditions combination of pastel colors perfect for spring events.","Runs large and long so I recommend a size smaller"
"6.0","Really makes you look heavy.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"6.0","Pros: It is well tailored and the cut and fit are exquisite.","It looks good on,Cons: It is not very comfortable.","Although the dress fit perfectly everywhere else, it was really tight in the chest and I could not get the dress on or off without someone zipping me up/down, which made it inconvenient.","Although the dress is described as maroon it is more like a brownish-purple color."
"6.0","The color is different the the picture; darker and not as vibrant.","It is also heavy.","With that said I received lots of compliments."
"6.0","Runs quite large and was very heavy.","Maybe would suit someone tall."
"6.0","I like the concept.","The skirt underneath was shorter than I liked for sitting in a meeting at work.","The waist was just a nudge tight.","Not a problem, except that where the skirt and the waistband met, the skirt hiked up a bit and just looked frumpy on me.","Id go a size up to avoid this problem.","Otherwise, I think its a great looking skirt."
"6.0","I was so disappointed.","This dress is absolutely stunning.","Unfortunately it was way too tight.","I have a muscular toned athletic body shape, I could not even get the sleeves past my elbows.","I usually wear a size 4 or size 6.","I thought a medium would be the proper size for me.","However I should have went with an large"
"6.0","Ran really big.","Like loose everywhere.","I wish I had sized down.","The fabric has no stretch so I was worried about it being too small but this was definitely too big."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful, elegant, and very easy to wear.","Unfortunately, it runs very large.","I ordered the 0, and while the dress was wearable, it was quite loose through the waist and hips.","I would have preferred to pin the dress in at the middle to give a more well-defined waistline.","Another word of note: this dress has an uneven hemline (with the back of the dress falling a few inches longer than the front).","This meant that the back hem of the dress fell well below my knees (Im 5 2).","Ultimately, I chose to wear my backup dress to the event."
"6.0","This was sent to me from RTR after my item became unavailable.","It just wasnt for me as I was on a romantic getaway with my husband.","This was probably more suitable for a brunch or something casual with the girls or even for work….but not for a romantic dinner in my opinion."
"6.0","The overall fit was fine, but it was way too long.","I am 56 and it drug on the floor even though I wore very high heels.","It negatively impacted my evening as everyone had to steer clear of me so as not to step on the dress.","Dancing was almost impossible."
"6.0","Love love the back I the dress!","!"
"6.0","Pro: Loved the detail at the bottom.","Wore with a black blazer over.","The neckline felt awkward with a blazer but didnt look it.","Also felt like my bra straps were sagging all day but it is the way the dress is cut on the sleeves with ric rac detail.","Lastly, the black on the ric rac looks a little faded and right in the center was creased were it folded up."
"6.0","The small would have been fine, but the zipper doesnt work well so I had to wear the medium.","The middle detailing on the dress was tight as well."
"6.0","Nice dress but I didnt have much luck with sizing.","The the material doesnt give at all.","Im a slim women and I had to get two sizes up from what I usually wear.","Pattern very unique.Very heavy material so this dress is perfect for fall/winter events."
"6.0","This dress is a little stretchy with a silky lining.","It fit perfectly in the hips but was a little big in the waist and way too big in the bust for me so I was worried about it falling down.","Still wearable but I wouldnt recommend unless your bust and hip measurements are close together."
"6.0","Sizing ran a bit small, so my postpartum chest was too big for both sizes I rented.","I felt like it accentuated my stomach area, which was disappointing.","Nice dress, but I thought the angles would help define a waist."
"6.0","I dont have large arms and the sleeves hit where it felt like your bra straps were slipping.","Tight in the bust and huge in the waist.","Not attractive on me, I think would be beautiful on taller body with smaller chest (the dress would fall in a more flattering fashion)."
"6.0","Warning- if youre tall or have a long torso the fit in the middle will be very tight.","I was pretty uncomfortable all night...not because it was the wrong size it was just that the middle is so short so it pulled on my shoulders all night.","However I didnt have time to look for another option so I put up with it.","I got the Long size because I thought it might help with this but that just adds length to the leg.","Also, beware of cleavage."
"6.0","Very pretty romper.","It is a little bit more snug than I thought it would be.","I ordered a Medium and the Large probably would have been too big but the Medium was a tad bit too small."
"6.0","This is a gorgeous dress and I LOVE that its a stretchy material.","It definitely makes for a more comfortable dress.","And the material is super thick and high quality.","The 2 cons I had about it is that I have larger hips, I would consider my body to be hourglass, and where the dress hem starts to flare out, it made my hips look HUGE and not in a good way.","It just didnt sit right and wasnt a great look.","The other part was the length, this would definitely be better for taller women.","Im 54 and it was an awkward shin length.","Not tea length but not to my knees.","I didnt end up wearing the dress, but with the right body type, it would be a great fit!"
"6.0","I got this dress in a 6 regular which was just hitting the floor, so if I wore heels it looked to short.","I got the 6L to see if it would be just the right length but even with heels its still really long and Im 56.","Im going to go with the 6R and wear flats.","This would be perfect for someone 57 or taller with heels"
"6.0","I should have ordered the small, not medium, then I would have been happier with the fit.","I felt like mom in this jacket when paired with all black underneath.","Would be cutest over a flirty dress."
"6.0","Wore this to a Sunday evening  wedding that was semi-formal.","I have a larger bust and am curvy so felt it was a little constricting.","I have definitely rented more flattering dresses.","No compliments on this dress, which is a first, always have gotten compliments on my other choices.","Its a classy, well made dress, just not great for my shape...."
"6.0","I did not end up wearing this dress but it fit very well.","The amount of fabric on top and in the bottom was proportionate to my frame.","The top fabric is hard to see in the picture on the website; it actually has green metallic throughout the top of the lace."
"6.0","I normally wear a 6, but I have a larger bust (34DD) and this style dress did not fit on the top.","I had to wear the 8R, which fit on top but was quite large in the hip area.","Also, it was pretty short and I had to get a shorter heel.","Even though the bust fit comfortably, the top kept rolling down where it looked like elastic was in place.","It was a beautiful dress, but just not a good fit for topheavy/smaller framed bodies."
"6.0","The dress is nice but doesnt fit a  petite frame well especially in the top.","The shoulders were clearly to big but I wore it to the wedding anyways.","This was my first time renting from RTR and have tried to rent from them afterwards and find it hard to find dresses that fit my frame."
"6.0","Overall gorgeous dress, a little short but I received so many compliments on this dress even a month after the event.","I guess you could say it was a memorable dress!"
"6.0","A memorable piece with good quality and structure.","Received many compliments.","Runs a little big through the torso.","I loved that it was fully lined and a heavier material.","Perfect for winter office wear.","Hard to wear frequently because its very unique and bold, but I really enjoyed it."
"6.0","I got this dress today.","I ordered 0R (my normal size) and 2R (just incase) but I cant use neither one of them.","They are extremely long.","When I researched a dress, I choose petite size since Im 51.","This dress pop-up so I ordered it.","Boy, I should have ordered something else.","Im already wearing 4 inches heels and this dress is still long.","I love RTR but this dress was a big waste of money"
"6.0","The dress is really cute!","However, I did not get to wear it.","The top was too large, the middle was too tight and the zipper was really hard to zip up."
"6.0","I was planning on wearing this to a baby shower but sadly couldnt get it zipped up.","It was tighter then I had expected it would be for sure.","I was super bummed but that invisible zipper-like many can be- was stuck and wouldnt budge.","I sent it back without getting to wear it..."
"6.0","The skirt is well made and very pretty, but I just had a hard time pairing it with the right top for work.","It is silk, so I chose a red silk top, but then felt like maybe I looked too bold with the color combinations.","Overall, I just dont think the look was for me personally."
"6.0","This was my original style for a black tie wedding I attended.","The sleeves were WAY too tight on my arms - it felt like they were going to cut off my circulation.","Granted, I do work out and have good bicep muscles but even then, I feel like the dress was too tight in the sleeves to begin with.","I had very little arm mobility in this dress.","This dress may have possibly worked in a size up but unfortunately, RTR was unable to ship my back-up size to me so I cannot say for sure.","Im bigger in the bust area so the V was definitely very pronounced in the size I had.","Again, I think a size up might have looked more like the dress does on the model.","I was disappointed in how this dress looked on me.","However, the slit in the back, the shape of the dress in the waist down, and the length were flattering."
"6.0","I never wore this dress, besides to try it on because it was too big.","I dont think I will ever reorder it though because it is a bit more conservative than my style.","The fabric is very stiff and the silhouette not very form fitting.","Its a beautiful color and has a very forgiving fit."
"6.0","Shirt was just meh.","It fit okay, but was not particularly flattering.","I wore it on a weekend and then to a staff retreat.","The fabric is cool and comfortable for the summer.","But the shirt does not stay off the shoulders.","It kept looking like a boatneck instead.","Yes, it makes you look pregnant but it is so comfortable so I wore it anyway."
"6.0","I couldnt button the waist and rarely have the issue!","Plus the bust is much larger and the skirt portion needs to be pinned as well.","Looked great pinned together!"
"6.0","I rented this blazer for work-wear, but find that it may be more suitable for casual wear.","It matches well with things, but the sleeves are short and so appropriate for Spring / Summer.","It is more of a staple item rather than a fashion statement item."
"6.0","The dress was more pinkish than gold...it was hard to find accessories to match at the last minute."
"6.0","Overall fit comfortable.","Its not long, so I have a longer torso which didnt make it as flowy on me.","The back is really cute.","Overall better for shorter girls."
"6.0","I got this through Unlimited as a potential dress for a wedding.","Im not sure if the 6 would have been better but the 4 was tight in all the wrong places so I ended up sending it back.","The pink was really pretty and the dress was really well made."
"6.0","I rented this dress as my first option along with a different dress as my back up option.","I ended up wearing my back up option and loved it!","This dress is very pretty but the coloring is off a bit from what appears in this picture and it is way more low cut.","This dress also gathers a bit around the waist/bust area giving a fuller fill and making you look a bit bigger."
"6.0","Bust area was way to large, I am pear shaped small bust area.","you cant tell in this picture that is was to big in the chest.","but had to take at least one picture."
"6.0","This dress is really comfortable.","I wanted it to work but it just didnt go with my body type.","I felt very wide in it.","The structure it good, it is a beautiful color and if you get it, size down!","Its that wetsuit kind of material that is very forgiving.","I got a 12 and a 10, but I felt that it didnt accentuate my waist.","I think perhaps a-line is just not a great style for my body type, not the dresss fault!"
"6.0","The dress is a beautiful print and design and flows really well.","The shoulder straps were a little long, but not unbearably so.","The biggest problem was the length.","Im 54 and even with 4 inch wedges, I was still tripping over the bottom of the dress.","Its a shame I didnt get to wear it because its a very flattering maxi.","That being said, I wouldnt recommend renting the regular length unless you are 55 wearing tall heels."
"6.0","Rented as a backup option only the small size was available.","I own a couple Clover Canyon dresses and tops in small, so I thought this would be a no-brainer.","My mistake... as I slipped this on I forgot to account for my holiday cookie and wine habit, which is usually corrected by a trusty pair of Spanx.","Please note this neoprene dress can not be worn with Spanx or any shaping undies...","Seriously, any line is absolutely visible, and Im pretty sure my bellybutton was also on display... Oh the horror.","Thanks holiday cookies and that third glass of merlot (yeah, I remember you).","I really appreciate it."
"6.0","The color of this dress is gorgeous !","I found the fit true to size But....","The material is very thin and sort of clingy - no way to wear spanx   So if that works for you than its a great choice, but if you feel more comfortable with shape wear, I say - keep shopping"
"6.0","I am 58 and this dress was long on me.","Very heavy and material irritated my skin, so I wore a diff dress.","Alot of ppl who i showed it to while wearing it thought it was beautiful and that i shouldve worn it."
"6.0","It looked so pretty in the photo but not so much on me.","As I am tall it was a little too short for a December gathering."
"6.0","I had been eyeing this dress for the longest time, and when the opportunity came I rented it for a family wedding.","The overall fit was ok, but there were some pain points:-the color is a more of a chartreuse than a deep yellow-the sleeves were baggy and the hem was not straight like its pictured.","Its more like the natural hem of the lace, which makes it look a little old lady-not flattering for the flat chested (lots of room)Overall, its average, but probably wouldnt rent again."
"6.0","Loved this dress!","It fit my petite figure perfectly and was a great choice for engagement photos.","Only problem were the straps that go over the shoulders.","They were way too long and not very proportionate to the size of the dress.","I had to safety pin them in the back and couldnt take any photos showing my backside.","Id recommend for photos but I definitely wouldnt be able to wear it to a party."
"6.0","Gorgeous dress with a fun neckline but if you have a large chest, good luck zipping it up!"
"6.0","I should start off with saying that I loved this dress.","However, I have DDs so it was a little tricky to get everything to stay in place.","I wore a sticky bra which did the trick but at the end of the night my shoulders were sore from the strings having to be so tight.","The only other con I have to say is the lining on the hem in the slip is plastic and there has been some sort of unfavorable treatment to it so the plastic has worn and causes the slip to flip up.","I took an iron, steamer and heavy books to it to try to keep it flat.","It worked for a little while but eventually went back to the flip.","The dress itself is stunning and I received so many compliments.","Luckily, only myself knew of the cons so I cant complain!","I would recommend this dress if you have time to take an iron, steamer and heavy items to the slip."
"6.0","I rented the 2, and a 4 as a back-up.","Putting the dress on was a little difficult because the fabric has absolutely no give.","The zig-zag part is tapered in on the dress; so its a little difficult to get around your shoulders putting on - but Im also a little broad.","The 2 fit like a glove - but the bodice looked weird when I sat down, so I opted for the 4.","The main difference to me between the two sizes was the length of the straps - they were a little longer on the 4,  which helps if you have a long torso like me.","I loved the dress, and it definitely amped up the LBD with the patterned design!","The only downside would be the proportions.","The zig-zag part didnt hit me where it does on the model - it hit me at my waist instead of my hips.","The picture isnt the greatest - but its the only one that had enough light to show the pattern!"
"6.0","I rented this as a back up dress and did not wear it.","The fabric is thin, and this gives it an everyday casual feel.","Also was not available in my size so the tight fabric was even less forgiving."
"6.0","I usually wear a size 4 and was expecting this to fit as it does on the model.","It was skin tight!","Definitely order up a size - at least one size!"
"6.0","Definitely recommend the long size as I am only 53 and this wasnt too long with heels.","Pretty dress, just not suited for my skin tone."
"6.0","The fit was good, the dress was too short for my liking but worked out fine!","The large fit my body but was a little snug on my chest."
"6.0","Really comfortable, but wrinkled very easily.","Pockets stuck out and made hips look bigger than they are."
"6.0","This was my second choice and I did not end up wearing it.","The dress has a side zip under the arm to enhance the snug fit.","This dress hugged my curves and looked fabulous.","It just wasnt my favorite in comparison to the other dress I rented."
"6.0","It was quite uncomfortable due to the embellishment on top but very pretty!"
"6.0","I did not end up wearing this I think it would be better on someone taller I am 52 and it flared too much at the hips and looked silly It is a beautiful dress though and other than that I would have worn it in a heart beat!"
"6.0","This was sent as a replacement dress when the original dress I ordered was damaged.","There were not too many options in stock that would fit my 6-month baby bump so I was not super excited to receive this dress.","The 10R fit comfortable (usually a 6/8 pre-pregnancy) but made me feel frumpy.","The horizontal stripes across my belly were not the most flattering aspect.","I would size down and maybe avoid if pregnant."
"6.0","I liked the dress but found the material a little heavy.","The dress a shorter than I usually wear but appropriate for work.","I got lots of compliments."
"6.0","I selected a 4R and 2L as my backup size after reading reviews from women with height and weight similar to mine.","I had been expecting a dress that was great for an hourglass shape as advertised.","I would strongly disagree with that assessment - and probably why the fit issue (I am fine-boned but have boobs and a butt).","The waist is not nipped-in at all on this dress - and it runs HUGE!","I probably would have been happier in the 0.","The material is fine, but I thought it was rather wrinkly and nothing spectacular.","The lining is heavy and smooth which I think generates all the favorable comments.","Hope this helps someone else!"
"6.0","I got this dress for my rehearsal dinner, and unfortunately it was waaaay too short to wear around my now-husbands family.","Would be absolutely perfect and gorgeous for a bachelorette though!","(which in retrospect is what a lot of girls wore this dress for!","I shouldve paid better attention!)","But, the great thing is the customer service dept sent out another dress and that one was perfect."
"6.0","Had to use a safety pin to keep it covered around my chest"
"6.0","Like many other reviewers mentioned, this dress has sort of a strange fit.","It is not very structured and falls off the shoulders.","However, the pattern is beautiful."
"6.0","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and was really excited about it--I loved the colors and that it was a little bit nontraditional.","The fit was really strange though.","The fabric has no give, so it was pretty tight around my hips and very loose on top.","Granted, my hips are definitely much bigger than my bust, but I had the same problem in the 2, which was HUGE up top.","Additionally, the loops kept showing through the arms, and because I could not wear a bra there was nothing to keep them in place.","If you rent this dress, definitely have fashion tape on hand--I wish I had!"
"6.0","Unfortunately I was unable to wear this dress.","This dress was a very beautiful gown, but it was too small on top.","I am definitely broader on top and this dress wouldnt meet to zip.","The bottom was full and would have hidden any hip or stomach issues.","Loved the pockets!","The length with heels would have fit just fine for me at 53.","I am bummed this dress didnt work."
"6.0","I loved the way it worked as a wrap around, and I loved the boho look.","However, I felt frumpy in it...even though I could wrap it, it never felt like it fit right -- definitely didnt do my curves any justice."
"6.0","Cute dress but not as great looking as the models photo.","I usually wear a 4/S and the small was very big.","The chest/shoulder area seemed oversized and unflattering.","Additionally the arm holes were gaping.","Bummed because I needed something like this for a work event next week and now I wont have the time to send this back and then get a new one in time via my Unlimited plan (which is an awesome investment btw.)"
"6.0","The dress was cute and summery - I love the long sleeves.","However, Im too tall for this dress (511) - the waist starts too high and then flares out, which was unflattering.","I thought it made me look bigger than I am.","The pattern was cute and I got compliments on the dress at work, but I wont rent it again - I thought it was slightly more of a sheath in the picture."
"6.0","Thought this dress was well made and lace was pretty but the hips were way too narrow for a pear shaped person.","Usually a 2/4 in Shoshanna fits me perfectly but this dress is very narrow.","As others commented the shoulders especially are quite tight.","Very elegant dress but not for me."
"6.0","Kind of tight, I wore a normal bra as recommended and it kept coming out of the dress."
"6.0","The dress was beautiful in person, from the waist down, the fit was wonderful.","However, it was extremely small in the chest.","I ususally wear a size 8 an ordered a 10 because I have large breast and the  zipper could not zip at all in the chest area and I did not want to force it.","However the Renthterunway staff was exteremely helpful when I called and immediately sent two other options overnight, which should arrive today and I hope theyf it!","While this dress is beautiful if your cup size is more than a D, then this dress is probably not for you."
"6.0","I had seen this dress pop up on our runway and thought it looked great on many.","I was a bit surprised by just how short it was.","The sleeves were cute and looked great on, but the back was really open - I ended up wearing a sweater for most of the night because I felt it a lot of skin showing otherwise.","Looks good in pics, but was not my favorite dress to wear out."
"6.0","I did not wear this jacket as the measurements were not as described.","I based my rental on the length that was listed and it was far shorter.","Its a cool jacket and maybe I should have known based on the reviewer pictures that the length was mis-stated.","I would say that the item does feel a bit small, its meant to go over something very thin/fitted.","The arms are short as well.","I am not a professional seamstress, but these are the measurements I took on XS:Shoulder to bottom hem - 19 (not 26 as listed)Pit to pit (across chest) - 16Pit to sleeve - 16."
"6.0","Very short crotch, but very flattering and structured if this works for your body type."
"6.0","fit well flattering to waistline"
"6.0","Overall, this was a great Vegas party dress and the color was a perfect shade of rose gold.","The pleating made me feel like my hips looked a little bigger than usual, and I had to pin the center closed as it was a bit too boobalicious, but the big drawback was the sequins under the arms.","I was so uncomfortable all night, and was red raw by the time I took the dress off.","The skin is STILL dry and flakey where it rubbed against the bodice, and I wore it a week ago.","Cute as it was, this dress has ensured that I never wear another fully sequined dress again in my life."
"6.0","I really enjoyed wearing this dress, although it isnt as flattering as some of the pieces Ive gotten from RTR.","It was nice sweater-like (but lightweight) fabric and moved easily.","Nice everyday dress, but nothing too special."
"6.0","I had to return both sizes I rented.","The bust area and the waist were too large in the size 4, but I doubt I could fit in a 2.","Im a 34B, so I was really surprised and disappointed.","It just looked loose and unflattering."
"6.0","Beautiful print and polished silhouette, but the material is woefully thin and unlined.","I realized only after I got to the office that the skirt of the dress is see-through.","Also, the pleating needed significant ironing.","As others mentioned, the pleats were dry-cleaned down and should be up.","Wouldnt rent again."
"6.0","Size S is too big for me."
"6.0","The color of this dress was pretty true to the picture and gorgeous!","The overall fit of the dress was ok except for in the arms.","The shoulders were so tight that it was impossible to move much at all.","The fabric in the skirt and the rest of the dress is stretchy - I wish they would have put that same fabric int he sleeves and the shoulders.","I will not be renting this dress again due to the fit in the arms."
"6.0","This dress looks much cuter online than in person.","The skirt of the dress is extremely poofy...so it looks strange on someone with a short frame.","It would be good for someone tall and lean - but not someone petite.","Also, the dress doesnt have lining and the fabric felt uncomfortable against the skin.","I returned without wearing"
"6.0","This dress runs a little big - its definitely bunchier than it looks on the model pictured, and the fabric is a bit different than pictured too.","But overall it was a nice dress for a fall wedding.","I received a  ton of compliments on it."
"6.0","Theres not much body to this sweater so it was just ok.","I really liked the surprise flashiness of the sequin sleeves compared to the casual sweater material...but I left a trail of gold sequins everywhere I went."
"6.0","The dress was probably 4 inches too long for me even with 3-4inch heels.","It was also way too big in the chest and on the shoulders.","It fit my friend really well, and the dress was a beautiful material and was really flattering on her.","It is fitted but flows at the bottom."
"6.0","Very tight around the waist but loose in the bust - not ideal for athletic body types!","The dress held its shape well however, and the issues with fit werent visible.","I had to wear flats or the regular would have been too short.","Nice silhouette and fabric, although it got very warm on the dance floor."
"6.0","Ran a bit snug.","Extremely complimentary to a not perfect shape."
"6.0","Rented this as part of my unlimited membership.","I really wanted to like this blazer, but the angle of the front made it difficult to pair.","Looked great when I did find opportunities to wear, but wouldnt rent again unless I had something specific in mind."
"6.0","It runs VERY large so I would order two sizes down from your typical size"
"6.0","I usually wear a 2 but wore a 4 in this dress, it was really tight - especially the sleeves and chest.","But then the waist wasnt as fitted which was a little odd.","The lace fabric chaffed a bit in the tights spots and was itchy, and because of the lace sleeves it was pretty cold.","I ended up wearing a cape over it all night to keep warm so I didnt get to show it off much.","A pretty color and dress, though."
"6.0","I wore this event to my office holiday party and after party.","It was perfect I paired with a black blazer and booties for classy day/work look.","Then for the after party I took off the blazer and the lace back detail killed.","I got compliments all night about how great I looked in the dress.","The only negative is that I had to fold down the high neck.","It fits more like a turtleneck, and my hair got caught in the zipper, so an up-do is ideal for this dress."
"6.0","Really cute shirt, I ordered a size 8 thinking it would be tight around my bust but it was really baggy all over so I would order down."
"6.0","The pink in the stripes is very hot pink.","It looked little girlish to me.","I did not wear it.","Other than that the material was great!"
"6.0","The bra area it a bit fitted, so I would recommend not wearing a push up bra."
"6.0","Nice fit skirt super cute"
"6.0","The dress is definitely unique - there was no one else at the wedding that was wearing anything like it.","The fit/material, however, isnt the best.","There is little to no give and the material is very thick - I felt like I was wearing a curtain.","At first, the 0 was way too small-feeling and I was going to go with the 2.","But the 2 was loose in random places and was not flattering at all.","Eventually, I ended up putting on the 0 for awhile before having to leave to loosen it up, and ended up going with that."
"6.0","This Theory dress came with tags still on, which is always fun!","The fabric was soft, but did wrinkle more than expected throughout the day.","My biggest issue was the length, which may have been my own judgement issue.","I wish it would have been 2 inches longer to be work appropriate, as I am not sure where else you would really wear this type of dress?","I could have possibly worn a 2, but knowing it may have then been even shorter, I stayed with the 4."
"6.0","Cute dress, but lining runs a little short (I am 511).","Worn to Easter brunch."
"6.0","I took a risk renting this and regretted it instantly, especially since I had nothing else to wear.","It ran very large, so I wish I had ordered the XS.","It was far too long on my torso, and the shorts were so short.","I was worried all day about showing my butt if I leaned over.","Im sure this would look great on someone who isnt petite with a large bust and long legs.","I suppose its made for tall, slim girls..."
"6.0","However, the fit was completely off.","As a petite young woman, I found this dress to be rather large and honestly WAY too long.","Ideally, I wanted to wear this dress for my birthday but I was unable to wear it and then I was super upset about that clearly.","Overall, I absolutely love RTR but this dress was subpar.","Rent a Herve Leger instead!",":)"
"6.0","this shirt was shorter in the body than expected.","It also had a bit of a boxy ft in the body."
"6.0","This dress has a great high-low cut, beautiful color, and has sturdy ribbing (did not have to wear a bra...Im a 36B) BUT holy hell was this thing heavy and thick.","I dont feel like the reviews or descriptions adequately conveyed this.","I rented this for an outdoor summer wedding and was VERY hot in it.","It was the thickness of a heavy curtain and I felt the weight of it all night.","I would love this dress if it was in a lighter fabric.","Lastly, I would suggest it for a spring wedding or an exclusively indoor summer wedding (somewhere with plenty of AC or a balmy temp setting)."
"6.0","Unless you are tall this sweater will take over your body.","It is too long and too wide for any one of my size."
"6.0","Somewhat of an odd fit; would better fit someone with a longer torso.","Tight around the chest wall and then cut fairly low in the back, so it was hard to adjust to fit better.","Also was quite short in the back, such that it nearly rode up to my butt when sitting.","Caveat that I am pregnant right now but the bump is still pretty small, and a couple of nights later I wore a size 2 in another dress (that fits TTS based on reviews)  Also-- this was a replacement dress when my original dress was not able to ship last minute, so I did not necessarily read up on the fit ahead of time as much as I normally would!"
"6.0","It just looked a little less classy than I wanted it to.","Might try a size up and see."
"6.0","Really pretty dress, but not the right one for me.","I have a small frame, and the dress was too big in the bust area, but nothing extra padding couldnt fix.","I wore 3 inch heels, and it was still on the floor.","Didnt wear this in fear of being stepped on/tripping over it.","Overall it was a gorgeous dress, sad it didnt fit right on me.","The 0P probably would have been perfect, but wasnt available for my event."
"6.0","I rented this dress last minute for my best friends wedding rehearsal dinner.","RTR only had one size available: 4.","Sadly, my back-up size: 6 wasnt available.","Based on the reviews, I decided to order it.","Sadly, I couldnt wear it to the event.","Although the dress fit like a glove, the lining below the lace kept riding up around my hips in one specific area.","It just didnt look good.","Plus, whenever I would sit down, the neckline would pull against my throat.","Obviously very uncomfortable.","Its a bummer because its such a cute dress.","Thankfully, I brought a back-up option that I owned and I was able to wear that.","A waste of money for the rental, but oh well."
"6.0","I ended up not wearing the dress.","It fit me a little snug.","It was a very beautiful dress and the process of ordering was very smooth.","I will definitely order from RTR again."
"6.0","I have an hourglass figure and Im very busty (bigger than the max 38D the website limits me to).","I usually like a bit of cleavage in my dresses.","This dress is beautiful and fit perfectly but not enough cleavage - I felt kind of dumpy.","I went with another dress instead."
"6.0","It fit how I assume the dress was made to fit..","There was additional room in the stomach area (which was kinda nice since I had a baby a year ago and still have some extra fat hanging around).","The length hit my knees and the dress had a conservative neckline as to not show any cleavage.","Overall, I did not love the dress.","I felt a little conservative and mom like.","(I did wear it with tights - but also like 5 inch heels.)"
"6.0","Love the print and material.","Unfortunately, the top was big; seemed like it had too much material in the chest area; it wasn’t flattering.","I wore my second pick for the wedding I attended."
"6.0","Too sparkly for photographs but fits very true to size."
"6.0","This was my backup dress and the appearance of the dress was nice, not amazing because the fabric had some snags, but was above my ankles"
"6.0","The fit is cute!","The jacket has a lot of shine!","The silver is VERY silver and VERY shiny - not what I expecting as I wanted to wear it during the day for work.","Maybe a better fit for a night out."
"6.0","It was a probably my own fault for not checking the length of this skirt before renting it, however it defiantly not work appropriate... or comfortable to wear.","I am tall (59) and slender and my booty is on the bigger size.","I work at a desk all day and I had to ask a colleague for a sweater to lay over my lap because it was SO short when I sat down.","Even when walking to work I felt a lot of baggage in the back in between my waist and bum.","It was pretty and I received compliments.","So if your body is anywhere around my dimensions I would measure carefully before renting.","Also- this skirt sits high waist and does not have ANY room or stretch so I highly recommend measuring and probably sizing up!!","Again- my own fault for not being more careful!","RTR is always great with shipping speed, the quality of items, and they give great detail.","I just wasnt paying close enough attention on this rental.","I will not be renting this one again.","For work related or non.","Just wasnt the right fit for me.","I will add pictures soon!"
"6.0","I wore this to a work event - needed a red dress to wear to it.","The lace was very pretty and in great shape.","Only found one random string that I had to cut off.","Runs a little small.","The con about this dress is the zipper.","It really takes some elbow grease to get it up, often requiring another person to get the job done.","Other than that, I was generally happy with this rental."
"6.0","I loved this dress on and it was amazingly sophisticated and interesting.","I received it in the mail to try on as a potential option for a wedding.","I did not choose it to wear as the issue was that it was a bit tight on the arms and a little snug in the middle.","I am not always a 0 in designers so that could be why, but from other designers from this site I am a 0.","I did not try the 2 but would keep this dress in mind for another event."
"6.0","I usually wear a 2, so put this one on and headed out to the wedding and unfortunately, didnt realize until I sat down in the car that although the dress fit, it didnt give/stretch at all and I couldnt really take a full breath the whole night, so that was kind of a bummer!","Might wanna make sure you can do that before you head out!"
"6.0","Its a gorgeous dress, but its heavy.","It was way too loose on top, and too tight on the bottom!"
"6.0","I wanted to like this dress and it had so much potential when I took it out of the garment bag.","I already have a short torso so it was surprising to have the waist of the dress fall above my natural waist line.","Because of that, the flounce of the dress was over exaggerated."
"6.0","This dress is very long.","Unless you are taller than 58 or want to wear sky high heels, I wouldnt recommend it.","With 2 heels I was tripping over the Regular length."
"6.0","This is a really pretty top, has nice fabric, and is low maintenance.","I wore it to work with skinny jeans and pumps and received compliments on it.","I wouldnt rent it if it wasnt part of Unlimited, but it was a good rental for Unlimited.","I ordered the medium because the small wasnt available, but could easily have worn the small too.","Nevertheless, the medium worked fine and looked great!"
"6.0","Got this for my try at home fit pack.","Dress material is really like a wet suit.","The dress might have been too tight, but it was riding up a lot when I was walking/moving around.","Didnt end up wearing it.","I thought the white seam at the front was much more obvious in person and overall I didnt love the dress.","I wouldnt order it again."
"6.0","Bright color w stretchy fabric"
"6.0","This dress fit okay, but it did not flatter my curves.","The fabric is gorgeous but very heavy and a bit itchy, with irritating bones inset through the bust.","Im 55 and about 125 with a fairly slender figure and I thought the mermaid shape would be flattering, but it actually made me look rather short and stout."
"6.0","Beautiful dress but this particular one seemed a little tattered.","Im not quite sure what happened but the bust area on both were stretched out and even though I sized down I kept pulling to up.","The boning on the side also jabbed into my skin."
"6.0","Very elegant, not too short, great for more conservative events.","Dress is very unforgiving in the abdomen/stomach area, need to wear Spanx unless you are thin."
"6.0","The dress was not bad but it had no definition.","The shoulders were a little narrow for me, and they bunched up as a result, so I dont think the dress was too big for me.","As a plus, the material is stretchy and its easy to wear.","It just wasnt interesting enough for me."
"6.0","I thought the dress was a beautiful bright color and well made.","The only downfall to this dress is that it is tight in the bust area.","When I put it on I didnt think it would fit but once you zip it, it was much more comfortable since the dress has some stretch to it.","I thought it had a nice length to it, I am 54 and it hit right in the middle of my  knee so with wedges, it was perfect.","This dress is perfect for someone with a small torso."
"6.0","This is a little heavier in person than it looks in the pictures (which is a plus for people in Florida in the Winter).","I shouldve sized up...when i sat down the slit opened up more than i wouldve liked.","Overall its cute, but i wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","I rented this for a graduation.","I generally am a true size 8 and got both size 6 and size 8.","The 8 was so big in the waist and hips.","The 6 was tight in the neck  and was a tight zip.","I ended up wearing the 6 because the 8 was so big it looked ridiculous but it was a little uncomfortable.","Its a pretty dress, but I wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","It was not the right fit for me.","Pretty dress though."
"6.0","Beware--If you have long legs or are tall, this dress will NOT look right on you.","Its a beautiful pattern but made me look very inappropriate for a formal event (Im 511 and have very long legs--34 inch inseam on pants)."
"6.0","This coat is lovely and I was very sad to send it back right away, but it was overwhelming on my frame.","I think it would be beautiful on someone tall and very slim.","On a shorter hourglass frame, it looked frumpy."
"6.0","It was a little too puffy in the hip area - didmt end up falling quite the way I was hoping for so I did not end up wearing it."
"6.0","I rented this and another dress  for my boyfriends office holiday party and ended up going with the other dress.","This piece is beautiful.","It has a great weight to it, which would have made it great for staying relatively warm on a cold evening.","I would not, however, recommend this dress for the petite ladies out there.","The sleeves are a bit overwhelming on a smaller frame.","And the pockets are a great addition but they make the shape of the dress toward the hips particularly wide, which I did not find flattering.","Perhaps if I were taller!"
"6.0","The long was just a hair too long and using fashion tape in the hem.","(It made the fabric buckle).","Also, Im small chested and this would be better on a woman with a more ample chest.","Overall, draped nicely, no itch underneath the arms like I had read in other reviews.","The only frustration was the zipper, which was hard to close."
"6.0","It ran a little baggy in the stomach area.","It also kept riding up as I walked."
"6.0","Very pretty (if heavy) yellow jacquard fabric, with full skirt lined with stiff tulle.","Liked the pockets (though theyre placed toward the front rather than sides).","The neckline was a little funny on me-- a very deep U-shape in front (as well as a fairly low back), so it showed a bit more cleavage than I wouldve liked but not in as pretty or flattering a way because the U shape of the front was deep and narrow."
"6.0","I was not a big fan of the fabric.","I knew it was thick from other reviews, but it was almost like a foam.","The edges of the hem were lifted a little bit from the cleaning/packing of the dress, and if I had time I would have tried to steam it to get them to sit down.","Overall it was a good dress, but I dont think I would rent it again."
"6.0","This Dress was cute but kinda of boxy....."
"6.0","I didnt wear this dress because trying it on I managed to split the lace at the top!","It was brand new - thank goodness for the insurance.","Be careful with this one...it was pretty though :) If I ordered it again I would get the Petite instead and a size up."
"6.0","The dress was a little tight, but the material had enough stretch to be comfy.","It lasted through a big dinner and then dancing at bars without being uncomfortable at all!"
"6.0","The dress and color were beautiful.","My only complaint was that I wished the waist was more fitted.","There seemed to be a lot of extra fabric in that area and my waist isnt overly thin.","Because of that, I didnt feel like the dress was very slimming.","Also, the arm hole for the side with a strap was pretty tight in my arm pit, so I probably wouldnt have been able to fit in a smaller size.","I was happy with the way I looked that night, but its not a dress I would buy due to the fit.","The whole experience with RTR was a very positive one and I will definitely be renting again."
"6.0"," I have mixed feelings about this look.","Its a little long in the crotch… So from the back its really not very flattering at all.","The fabric is very heavy which makes it look expensive  however it almost reads a little bridal… I could easily see a wedding gown being made from the same fabric.","I think it would be great for a wedding shower, rehearsal dinner…or wedding exit outfit.","It also smashed my boobs a little.","And my husband said it looked like a spacesuit.","So in the end I didnt wear it."
"6.0","This dress was ok.","I didnt end up wearing it, but it would have been alright in a pinch.","Wasnt in love with it though.","The original dress I planned on wearing never showed up, so RTR graciously let me pick another one and sent it overnight!"
"6.0","I wanted to love this dress.","The color and the lace were beautiful, but the dress was obscenely short.","I am not that tall, but the dress was mid-thigh on me.","I felt that it was inappropriately short for the wedding I was going to.","I am so sad it did not work out"
"6.0","This dress fit well, but it didnt end up being formal enough for the event I was attending so I wore the other one I rented instead.","Its cute, but the way the lace lays, it makes it look not as formal as Id have liked."
"6.0","If you have a longer torso, this will run a bit short on you.","I have tried many rompers from RTR and have not had any issues, except with this one.","I was still able to wear it, but it was just not as comfortable as other rompers.","Also, the color in some pics appeared to be much brighter and more vibrant colors, but the color is actually very true to the image on the model.","It is a cute romper and I would recommend for everyday."
"6.0","It was much longer than it appears on the site.","I probably wouldnt have worn it if my mother didnt do a hell of a pin job.","Too long for short girls."
"6.0","Cute and sporty, but a little long for me.","Loved how light and breathable the fabric was tho!"
"6.0","So, the dress I tried on in store was much looser in the bust than the dress I received.","Overall, the fit was true to size, but I ended up having to remove my bra because it was just so tight in the bust.","Additionally, the straps were too long, and I had to pin them.","Someone at RTR said they would make a note and have them fixed for me, but that was not the case.","In the end, the dress was beautiful, but just okay because of a few factors."
"6.0","I got plenty of compliments on the dress.","Complete strangers stopped me said how much they loved it.","the dress is slimming.","It was however too big in the stomach, back and butt.","I am 59 and definitely needed the long with heels.","The 8 would have been even prettier"
"6.0","The size was too small resulting in me not being able to wear it.","A friend of mine was able to fit into it."
"6.0","It ran kind of big, but was forgiving and flattering."
"6.0","First of all, as always the Rent the Runway customer service was great.","The dress came on time and was in perfect condition.","Unfortunately, though, this was my least favorite rental Ive had from RTR.","The dress is very mature, and while I can see it being lovely on someone 50+, it wasnt great for someone my age.","Also, despite wearing 4 inch heels I still had to pick it up and carry the train whenever I walked, which was annoying.","I have a very small bust, so perhaps thats why this dress felt like it ran large.","Im in between a 2 and a 4 for a dress size these days, and the 2 had room to spare.","Plus, the dress was heavier on the bottom, so with the neckline I had to keep hoisting it up.","Overall, it was fine, but its a pretty boring dress, not fun or interesting at all."
"6.0","I was very excited for this one, but it just didnt work out for me.","The material isnt as heavy as other beaded/sequin dresses and because of this it wasnt as flattering.","I also found the shoulders to be ill-fitting making me look far more broad than normal."
"6.0","Too long"
"6.0","I stared at the photo on the website for what seemed like hours, but couldnt figure out how to drape this.","Also, I ordered a M (my reg size) and it was huge.","All in all, a miss for me."
"6.0","The dress looked great; however, it scratched under my arms and left red marks from the irritation.","I received so many compliments on the dress that the irritation was a small price to pay!"
"6.0","it looks like a large sack on me.","looks a lot better on my gf, who is actually the same height as me, but has a different body type.","she is thinner and has a more athletic body, smaller bust.","that being said, it is extremely comfortable because it is very large.","it look acceptable if it is worn with high booties, but otherwise it just looks silly on me."
"6.0","I felt like the shoulders ran small and the fabric was thicker (more like a quilt) than what I originally expected."
"6.0","I was a bit disappointed.","Ive never been disappointed with any of the rentals via RTR except... for this one.","The color is more reddish than what is shown in the picture.","I thought it would be a glitzy silver dress, but the red shine was a bit too much for me and I didnt find the dress to be attractive at all.","Ended up not wearing it.","RTRs service was great, however, this time around again, but a wrong choice of dress.","Learned to be more careful with whats seen in the pictures... make sure to google dresses for other images before renting."
"6.0","I loved the pattern of this dress and the unique open back, but the fit was so awkward!","It seemed too loose on the top half of my body, but incredibly tight through the waist/hips and then loose again at the bottom.","The slip of this dress is asymmetrical, which ends up making it super short on one side where it didnt even fully cover my bottom.","I was pulling it down constantly, and felt uncomfortable in it all day.","Maybe if I had sized up it would have been better, but then I think other areas would be way too loose.","Very disappointing, because it could have been such a beautiful dress if the fit was right."
"6.0","The cut of this dress and the pictures gave the impression of a structured cotton dress, but it is actually a very stretch dress.","I rented this dress to wear to a day-time event and, at least for someone of my height, it was really more appropriate for a night out with friends.","I didnt end up wearing the dress, for this reason."
"6.0","This romper would be perfect for everyday, casual wear.","I did not get to wear it because it was too short in the stride.","I am not tall by any means and this romper did not have enough room between the crotch and waist.","May work well on shorter women or those with a shorter torso."
"6.0","This top is cropped and depending on which way the ruffles are ironed, it shows the underneath white lining."
"6.0","Super cute dress but was too small thru the rib cage.","Also the material appears matte online but has a metallic shimmer to it in reality.","Would be perfect for a daytime party."
"6.0","I tried this dress on with the at-home try-on program.","The six was too small to fit my massive rib cage.","A pity--its a cute dress."
"6.0","I wanted to love this jacket but ended up not even wearing it.","The body of the jacket fit as to be expected but the sleeves were very long and wide.","There are zippers on the cuffs that weigh down the fabric and make it impossible to roll the sleeves for a tighter fit."
"6.0","The color of the dress is gorgeous, and I was really excited about it!","Unfortunately, it runs way, way large -- Im not sure an XS would have fit me, and normally a small works perfectly."
"6.0","Cons: Sequins tend to make you look a little wider in the waist unless the dress is specifically design to skim the waist.","This one is not.","Pros: Overall, the dress is a nice length and youre sure to stand out.","Ruching definitely hides any tummy issues!"
"6.0","I usually wear a 6 and ended up wearing the 6 (even though the notes said to go a size up).","This was mainly because I wanted a little room given its a pretty form-fitting dress and not that forgiving (without spanx).","It also was showing wear and tear on the lace, which makes me think its a popular dress.","Not sure if I would rent again, but did receive nice compliments!"
"6.0","The sequins had ripped up my arms pretty badly by the end of the night, but otherwise it was a comfortable and flattering dress that received many compliments."
"6.0","I didnt love the dress on me.","It was a bit big in the chest but fit comfortably everywhere else.","The material is a lot thicker than I expected it to be - it kind of felt like a full coverage bathing suit."
"6.0","Dont bend over, careful sitting down, and watch out that you dont drag your sleeve in the salad.","I loved the embroidery, but it was just off on the proportions enough that it felt a bit like a costume."
"6.0","I tried it on and it was very nice.","but not age appropriate for me (32).","Very heavy and didnt move well, especially not for a night of dancing!","Perfect dress for a winter event Id think (not for a FL July wedding)."
"6.0","I liked the comfort of the dress; however the dress was too long for my height which probably attributed to the dress making me look boxy and probably combined with the pattern of the dress.","I ended up keeping my jacket on it all day during work as I didnt feel that confident in the dress on its own...although I did enjoy wearing it for its color and comfort - if that make sense.","The 3 stars is primarily due to the dress not complimenting me very well on its own."
"6.0","I rented this for a Xmas party for work.","The dress was pretty but ran small.","I usually wear a 4 but wore a 6 in this dress and it was still on the tight side.","There was a large hole in the lace of the sleeve that was really noticeable...had to get creative to hide that since I couldnt wear the other size dress.","As others have stated it is short..I worn opaque tights under mine.","If you will be doing a lot of sitting, make sure you are prepared with something for on your lap.","Luckily I had a napkin for dinner to cover how high it rode up.","The shipping procedure was great!"
"6.0","The dress came with the tags on so that was a plus!, i am very tiny and slender.","This dress was a 0 and it still hung on me.","maybe a 00 wouldve fit me better.","The material is perfect and it flows, not itchy or too thick, great for work and its very neat looking dress"
"6.0","Sleeves were way too long, had to roll them up and they kept falling.","Everything else fit great, but the sleeves were a major issue."
"6.0","I have a large bust so the dress was gorgeous, but it didnt fit.","The backup size wasnt available so I was hoping that this would do the trick, but it didnt.","I wear a 36DD so although it was my dress size, it didnt fit my bust."
"6.0","Ive worn several other Clover Canyon neoprene dresses in size S and they usually fit very well.","This one was a little too form-fitting.","I wore it, but with a blazer over it so it wouldnt look too vavoomy!"
"6.0","I was a little disappointed with the fit of this dress--0 was too small in the hips, 2 too big on top.","A friend helped me use safety pins to tighten the back a little bit.","Once we had it all adjusted, the dress looked great!","Super classy and elegant."
"6.0","I have had my eye on this dress ever since I signed up for RTR!","However, I was a little disappointment in the way it fit me.","The shoulder pads were much larger on me than they looked on the model and the dress felt very short.","I was uncomfortable most of the night because it kept riding up.","When I sat down it was just way too short.","The dress is made with a thicker material that you wont need spanx."
"6.0","Loved the dress but was unable to wear it, I normally wear a size 4 but should have gone down to a 2.","Since the dress was new to the site and had not been reviewed I was unsure what to order as a backup size.","I did rent another dress as well that worked out perfectly but was really hoping to wear this instead."
"6.0","Rented this dress for a work holiday party.","Super cute, fun dress.","Received a lot of compliments but my arms were super irritated at the end of the night.","I rented sequence dresses before but this is the first time I had irritation.","The front is very low cut so if you are lucky enough to be larger chested than me (90% of women fall into this category ) it might be a little too sexy for a work party"
"6.0","This is a very flattering dress, so long as youre not moving.","I was constantly pulling the dress to the right, as the left shoulder strap kept pulling it to the left, exposing my adhesive bra.","There is also no split in the skirt, making steps somewhat of a concentrated task.","With that said, I still received a ton of compliments.","I dont think anyone noticed my struggles...lol"
"6.0","I have a long torso and thought that this was a little short-waisted on me."
"6.0","The material was a bit thick and the legs were too long for my 54 size."
"6.0","I didnt wear this unfortunately, the sleeves were way too long"
"6.0","not made for busty girls because of the cut outs.","My bra was sticking out so i couldnt wear it and had to return."
"6.0","I was super excited about this, but it ended up being too small in the hips.","In addition, the torso was a little too short for me.","I think going 1 size up would solve it."
"6.0","The 12 was too big in the ribs / bust, and the 10 was too small in the hips.","The dress is very soft and would be an awesome party dress!"
"6.0","I rented this dress along with another style for my bosss wedding this past weekend.","The first dress I tried on was much too big for me to wear and upon examining this gown I noticed unraveling along the waist at the seam and down the peplum skirt.","I was beyond upset that they would send me a dress in this condition.","I knew they would not be able to get another out to me in time so I turned to my amazing mother/excellent seamstress and she was able to fix it.","I ended up wearing the dress (after it was beautifully sewn up) and received many compliments.","RTR apologized and sent me a refund and a credit, all in all just happy we were able to resolve everything!"
"6.0","Cute pattern and details but just too big and boxy in the fit.","Wanted to love it but it was meh.","Heavier than I expected but not too warm as I feared."
"6.0","A bit boxy.","I usually size down for Erin Fetherston and didnt in this dress because of other reviews but wished I had."
"6.0","This romper is absolutely stunning but I am 58 and it was too short.",":( I havent tried the Medium yet because the Small fit perfectly everywhere else-- even the sleeves were the perfect length.","This would be perfect for someone who isnt quite as tall!"
"6.0","I ended up not wearing this to my event because I wasnt crazy about the fit.","This dress was 2 sizes up from what I normally wear (I usually wear an 18 and this was a 22) and it still created some problem areas around the tummy area.","The length was fine, but the material is unforgiving so make sure you wear Spanx or some other type of shapewear on this form-fitting gown!"
"6.0","The print is very pretty, but it ended up being too conservative for what I wanted.","The skirt has a really heavy lining that didnt feel right for an outdoor summer party, and the fabric honestly was not as luxe as I was expecting for a dress of this price.","The silhouette is flattering, but definitely not at all sexy.","Overall, not my favorite, but again, gorgeous print!"
"6.0","My first time using RTR and I cant believe how easy this was.","This is a gorgeous dress, as its simple but has a small bit of flair.","Unfortunately, the hanger straps were dancing around every time I moved, and it made for a very uncomfortable experience.","I was constantly wondering if the straps were showing, and 9 times out of 10, they were.","Next time I will use the fashion tape included in the rental, but I didnt even realize there was any until I had already returned the dress!","I also only ordered the size 2 because I knew a 4 would be too big, and the dress does not come in a 0.","The dress is fairly long, as it comes right above the knee.","However, this could also have been the case for me simply because the dress was too large.","I paired this with the Kate Spade Heavenly Cluster neckace, and it was a perfect match."
"6.0","Snug through hips.","No give in the fabric!","Not great for a well-endowed bust!","Beautiful gown, but sadly disappointed.","Maybe next time."
"6.0","Color was great.","Much more purple and brighter in person.","The top part of the dress was perfect, and a little big compared to the bottom.","Wish the dress overall wasnt fitted and had some flair to it.","Even though the dress was a thick material you could see EVERYTHING through it.","If your self conscious about your stomach area this dress wouldnt be for you."
"6.0","The dress is a great fit, especially if you are curvy and worry about rentals fitting your hips.","I was honestly a little disappointed in the quality of the dress.","Ive rented several dresses from RTR, and they have always been in new, pristine condition.","Its time to retire this one - it looks and feels worn, and the lining was longer than the dress.","Also - I am 55 and ordered the regular length according to size & fit notes, and it was ankle length.","I needed a floor length gown, and with heels, this one was at my ankles.","I wished that I had ordered the long."
"6.0","This shirt is overall pretty tight mostly due to the material.","The way the arm/neckline are it cuts in a bit and wasnt that flattering.","Its also a bit short if you have a long torso.","The neckline looks so good on the model but I think the way that the material is it doesnt really fall the way it does in the picture.","I didnt end up wearing it."
"6.0","I liked this top but did not love it.","The material was not as silky as I had hoped.","Seemed pretty non special."
"6.0","This dress was a great length and fit my midsection like a dream- but was loose and baggy almost floppy around the collar, not a dress for a small busted person"
"6.0","I rented this for my bridal shower but didnt end up wearing it.","The dress technically fit, but was weirdly proportioned.","The whole top ran small for me -- shoulders, sleeves, and the length of the torso.","The natural waist fit well, but then the lower stomach area and entire bottom was almost baggy and much longer than in the picture (and Im 58, not short).","The fabric has no give at all, so theres no wiggle room.","Im usually a 6, but can go up to an 8, and both sizes seemed to fit exactly the same way.","They technically fit my body, but super uncomfortably restricting on the top half.","Ill rent a different dress again tho, love RTR!"
"6.0","Pretty, but a little fuller in the bottom than it appears in the pictures.","I am usually a solid size 2 - the 2 was tight, the 4 was big."
"6.0","This dress is really fun to wear!","It is VERY stretchy and clingy.","It hugged me a little much in the areas I tend to try to disguise so I paired it with some spanx tights.","Great party dress!"
"6.0","I didnt actually get to wear the dress, unfortunately, due to the snowstorm this weekend.","The body of the dress fit true-to-size (consistently size 6 with Rent the Runway selections), although the lace cap sleeves were way too big and therefore draped funny around the back of my neck and shoulders.","Overall I liked the dress, but didnt love it like I did my previous two RTR rentals."
"6.0","I found the dress to be a little large at the top.","The way the dress flares out at the waist where the pockets hit was not the most flattering look for me."
"6.0","Great color, but this was not for me.","The ruffles seemed to be much larger in person.","The overall fit was also very large."
"6.0","The jumpsuit was beautiful and elegant.","Looking at the pictures, I thought it would be cotton more so than satin but I didnt mind.","The overall fit was a little loose for me but I felt the size 2 would have been too small.","The best part for me was not wearing a bra!","There were two things that made it a tad annoying.","1) Im 52 so, unfortunately, the pants length was too long.","Even when I wore heels, it was still too long.","2) The zipper was very difficult to zip up once youre in it.","Overall, the jumpsuit was ok but I probably would not order this again."
"6.0","this is a well made, super fun and summery dress.","unfortunately, it didnt work out.","typically, wrap dresses fit my figure nicely (even at 5 ft 3 in) however,  this was simply too long.","there was way too much fabric.","it swallowed me.","i imagine it will look amazing on tall broad shouldered women."
"6.0","Great cut and very unique.","I didnt like the gold brass buttons sewn up and down the front."
"6.0","The color of this dress is most definitely TAN, like camel-colored, as opposed to the more pinkish tone shown on the model.","That was a little disappointing since I have blonde hair and had gotten a spray tan for this event, so I was afraid Id look monochromatic - cue the last minute hunt for accessories to brighten up the look.","The snaps on this dress are absolutely worthless, but I knew this prior to renting from other reviews; I pinned the dress in the front to avoid any mishaps.","Also, the dress was folded in half when I received it, so there was a deep wrinkle across the skirt.","I dont know if Id rent this dress again, but I did get a lot of compliments on it."
"6.0","The print on this skirt is adorable and a great look for summer.","The fabric is very thick, which I expected, but it meant that the shape was stiff especially when sitting.","Love the pockets though one had a hole in it.","Probably wouldnt rent again but it was fine to wear once."
"6.0","Arms too tight.","Awesome top, but just didnt fit my body right."
"6.0","I received many compliments on this dress.","I am 55 (A cup, 125#) and I did not find it to be too short, even with heels on.","Due to the terrible zipper, the size small dress was impossible to zip beyond the halfway point.","Even with assistance from others.","Bad design.","Frustrating.","The zipper on the medium sized dress was also problematic, but I could zip it up most of the way and then yank it over my head.","It was the only way.","Because I am an A cup and I had to wear the larger (looser) dress, I had to get some stick-on bra cups to enhance the area.","Overall, things worked out.","I am torn on recommending the dress because it was so frustrating to zip.","However, if you can get it on it is so flattering.","Positives about the dress are that it looks stunning in person, it hangs nicely - the fabric is luxe.","It is a great cut if you need to camouflage your belly.","I felt pretty in it.","Based on all of the combined feedback, I think RTR should do some quality control because the zippers so problematic."
"6.0","Im 54 and it was pretty long and loose.","Usually wear a 0 but it felt like one or two sizes too big"
"6.0","This dress is gorgeous and definitely stands out.","I received tons of compliments.","It photographs beautifully as well.","With that being said, I only give it three stars because there are quite a few negatives to the fit and cut of this dress.","It is VERY tight and has NO ROOM for give around the ribs and high waist.","The straps dont stay up.","Its almost as if they should have been placed lower on the backside of this dress.","I used tape on the upper part of the strap and the neckline.","I normally wear a size 6.","I wore a 10R and felt like the dress was going to pop every time I breathed in, sat down, or bent over.","The clasp actually broke before I even left the house.","If you are even somewhat unsure of the size, read the reviews very carefully and size up at least one size.","I would even recommend going up two sizes, if possible.","If you are very small or very large chested, beware.","I wear a 36D and had a Janet Jackson moment, despite having double sided tape on the neckline.","If you are small chested, you will probably have trouble filling out the front of the dress."
"6.0","This dress was perfect for a summer BBQ on the beach.","Its easy to wear and comfortable and at 50 the length was actually nice - more like a midi.","Only thing is its not very flattering but would still recommend for an easy everyday dress to throw on!"
"6.0","The top was far too big to be wearable, and Im not sure going a size down would have fit my hips.","It was unfortunate - its a beautiful dress on."
"6.0","I rented this for a party, but ended up wearing my back up dress instead.","The dress was super short.","If the fabric stayed in place, I would have worn it, but every time I moved, the dress moved up higher.","It would probably look better on someone who is a bit shorter."
"6.0","Pants are like I said nice.","Comfortable but not special.","I did wear them and the fit was nice.","Not the material I expected more polyester feeling.","Nice place pink w/ charcoal lines.","Relaxed and comfortable enough to run around in on the weekend!"
"6.0","This dress is much shorter than the pictures suggest - the model must be 52.","Im 57, and dont mind a short skirt, but it felt pretty short for work for me.","This is compounded by the stretchy nature of the fabric, so it crept up when I was sitting.","The leatherette trim made this dress more interesting.","The styling was good and work-appropriate."
"6.0","This dress was gorgeous and I received so many compliments on it.","Definitely a classic show-stopper if you ask me.","The sleeves do have zippers- that was a little weird but no one could tell when I kept them zipped.","The size 2 actually fit really well; however, I was concerned with the length in the front.","With all the swing dancing at the wedding, I went with the 4 to add a bit more length in front."
"6.0","While the upper portion of the dress fit well, the pockets (which I thought would be a great feature) actually added an awkward bulge to the dress around my hips.","The pockets were not smooth to streamline the fit, and made the dress quite unflattering (this was true even in the bigger size, which was swimming on me).","This issue is not so visible on the model because she has one hand IN the pocket and the second covering her hip, but if you scroll through the user photos you will notice the awkward pockets on a significant number of ladies.","When I noticed this in the user photos initially, I thought it had something to do with the shape of the women themselves.","Hindsight is 20/20!","Personally, I have no hips, and have never had a challenge with a dress looking bulky around that area - if anything, I struggle to fill out a dress in my hips/waist.","My friends all agreed the dress was overall not a flattering look, and I wish I had looked closer at the user photos before committing to the dress!","I would not rent again."
"6.0","BUT!","This dress was very tight around the rib cage and had a lot of fabric up at the top.","I had to pin up the shoulders to make this dress work and the pin hole in the center seemed bigger on me than in the photos and I felt like I was exposing too much side boob.","This dress would have been a total winner if I owned it and could get it altered appropriately."
"6.0","Unique and very sparkly.","I wont rent again but it was fun  to wear and I received a few compliments."
"6.0","This dress runs very large- the other reviews were right!","I usually wear a 6 or 8 and I wore a 4 in this dress.","The dress was way too low cut for my body shape and in reality is much more low cut than it shows in the picture.","I am small on top, and this dress barely covered me."
"6.0","I wore this dress for my sisters bachelorette party.","The fit was pretty spot on, form fitting without being too tight.","I was glad to see that the arms actually fit (a little tight, but wearable).","I was nervous about the long sleeves since I have pretty muscular arms and that can be a problem sometimes.","It was sparkly without being over the top and it was also pretty comfortable.","However, I cant say I loved this dress, as there were a few issues.","It was not the most flattering dress on me.","I think this was due to the combination of the wide neckline and my big shoulders/traps.","If you have a more muscular upper body this might not be the best dress for you.","The wide neck also was slightly annoying since I wanted the support of a real bra, I had to keep checking to make sure my straps were tucked in.","As other reviews mentioned, the length was a little awkward--kind of long.","Im pretty short (5 2.5) so maybe itd work better on a taller person.","Also, I had issues throughout the night with the dress shifting to one side.","There is only ruching on one side of the dress and it kept pulling toward that side, so I was constantly turning it back to center.","Overall, the dress fit the occasion and I got a lot of compliments, but I was a little disappointed and wish I would have picked a different one instead."
"6.0","I rented this dress to wear in California on the beach.","The material feels amazing on and I like the attention to detail.","This dress is flowy I could have gone down another size if I needed to.","If you button all of the buttons, the fit of the dress looks strange so I left a few undone.","Compliments: 1Would I rent again?",": NoHow to style it: with a dress this long, I think some type of heel would look best"
"6.0","Wore this on New Years Eve to dinner with my sweetie.","It was pretty but I wouldnt rent it again.","It wasnt *that* special, it was just nice."
"6.0","I rented this dress for a very special dinner party and the material and color were absolutely beautiful but the dress in my size wasnt available so i got it one size bigger just in case it ran small and it actually ended up really big and heavy on me :("
"6.0","Im usually a 00 and the small fit well.","The fabric was very thick but for some reason this dress was a little tricky with panty lines - it was nearly impossible to find an undergarment that could be worn with no line.","Another word of warning - the cut outs go down very low, Im pretty flat so they may have come down lower on me than they would on someone who would fill in the dress a bit more up top.","I had to find a camisole to wear under the dress to make it decent.","I loved the length and the sleeves and received a few compliments on this dress but I probably would not rent again."
"6.0","I wore this dress in June to celebrate my birthday night out, looking for something fun and easy to dance in.","This dress was definitely fun, with the black and gold sequins and the intricate design.","However, the reason I only gave it 3 stars is because for me, the silhouette was not as flattering as I would have hoped.","For a shift, I would have preferred it to be little slimmer, especially near the hemline and a little shorter.","Also, the material with the sequins (especially around the arms and the neckline) irritated my skin a little bit, so I was not entirely keen on that.","Overall, a fun dress to go out in, probably more appropriate for New Years Eve, but I dont know if I would rent this again."
"6.0","The fit was just awkward for me.","I felt like the waist fit at a weird spot on my hips that made me look wider.","If I pulled it up more to my natural waist, it was too short on bottom and too much fabric on top.","I didnt end up wearing, sent it back right away.","Might work better on someone less curvy."
"6.0","This dress runs VERY small.","Glad I ordered the size up for my backup size.","In my backup size, there was a hole in the lace and someone had hemmed the dress up way too short for me so unfortunately I couldnt wear this dress for my event.","I had to wear my backup style I chose, which ended up being great and when I called RTR, they were very nice and apologetic and refunded me for the original dress not being able to be worn."
"6.0","This was my second option and I only rented the 4R, so I may have at least ordered the 2R just to see the fit next time.","It was true to size, but a little long.","I am 5ft.","4in and wore 3-4in black heels.","I really liked this dress, but it just did not compare to the other rental so I went with that.","I thought the tan lining underneath just did not look right...had it been black, I probably would have gone with this one!"
"6.0","This two piece dress/shirt is cute and could be worn three ways theoretically which is nice.","The print and colors are nice, but none of the cuts are flattering.","I liked it, but I wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","I wasnt able to wear this dress because it was not flattering on me, BUT it is a pretty dress.","Id say youd need to be a little on the curvy side to fill it out properly.","I am pretty straight up and down and athletically built, so the 4 was a little too small and the 6 just hung.","I thought about belting it, but decided to simply order another dress.","RTR was beyond helpful with this and I still dont have a negative thing to say!","Excellent service!"
"6.0","I wore this dress on my birthday to work and then out to dinner.","It was good for a day, but I wouldnt rent it again because the fit is abut awkward.","It was really tight around my hips/butt, but a little too loose at the chest and the high neckline was uncomfortable when I sat down.","I loved the colour, but the awkward fit is why I gave it three stars."
"6.0","This dress wasnt the original dress I rented, the dress I originally rented was too large.","So when I called customer service this was the dress we agreed upon to replace the other.","Sadly I did not end up wearing this dress either.","I did not feel comfortable with the way the dress fit, mainly in my chest region.","Customer service sent me the 8&10 because this dress tends to run large, normally I am a 12 and the 10 fit perfectly.","The V is cut deeper than I am comfortable with so fashion tape was used to close that up a bit.","But still I felt like my chest was the focal point in this and it emphasized the chest is a manner that made me feel uncomfortable.","Overall it is a beautiful dress, the color was a beautiful blush and it was a comfortable fit.","For me though, it just didnt work."
"6.0","The fit was odd for my height- the waist seemed too high for my 6 foot tall frame and the capped sleeves were very short and restrictive to upward arm movements.","Despite that it was roomy in the waist and hips so the fit was overall not flattering."
"6.0","Lovely dress and fabric, but all the gathering in the waist with the thicknesses made me look thicker in the waist than I am.","I didnt end up wearing it, even though it runs true to size.","The design didnt flatter my figure."
"6.0","I worn it with a belt to make it more fitting.","Like but dont love."
"6.0","This dress was fine for a casual daytime dress, but I found that it ran large and overall just wasnt that flattering."
"6.0","It didnt fit - I had to return without wearing.","I had a 6 week old so my body was not its normal self but I wear a 4 or 6 in dresses and the 6 didnt even zip.","I should have tried the 8 but I didnt love the dress as it was.","The colors were great but the skirt was too full for my liking and it desperately needed a steam/iron.","The fabric wasnt very forgiving.","It was so pretty though... too bad!"
"6.0","Everyone kept giving me wonderful comments on the dress.","I was super comfortable in it all day.","Definitely didnt want to return it!"
"6.0","This dress didnt wow me.","I was going to a bridal shower and I didnt have anything to wear so I decided to rent a cheap RTR dress.","I wanted to go with something that was true to size (Im usually a size 6 but winter weight has me at an 8) and looked like it would look good without getting a back-up.","This dress did the trick.","I was actually complimented by the bride on my dress so Im happy I got a good option.","I guess I just wasnt blown away by it.","Its safe and very comfortable so if thats what youre looking for, go for it!"
"6.0","This dress fit a little snug, just as the other reviews mentioned.","RTR was out of a 10 so I ordered the 8 and it was too small to wear.","Also the sequins under the armpit are really uncomfortable."
"6.0","It is comfortable but not very flattering."
"6.0","Loved the look of the dress on the model, however its very tight in the tummy area and exposes any flaws...spanx are a must!","It also fit oddly on the shoulders so I never ended up wearing the dress to my friends wedding."
"6.0","Summery, cute print.","To casual for work, but cute for a weekend."
"6.0","I just felt like it aged me.","Id either have to be a lot younger and cooler or older and suitable for this.","I think if it was black and did not have the border on the neckline it would have suited me well.","I will try out some other jumpsuits and see what I find."
"6.0","My dresses arrived late -almost too late for my event.","I called and spoke with Whitney in Customer Service and she very happily rectified the situation in a professional manner.","That said, I did not end up wearing either of the sizes ordered because our event was cancelled, however, I consider that to be a blessing in disguise.","I found the rouching to be very unflattering around my midsection and the size 8R wasnt in top condition by any means.","There was visible boning poking out of the bodice and the sequins near the zipper enclosure seem were too close to the skin so it would rub my back CONSTANTLY .","My skin was very very irritated (even with Bandaid Friction Block) and my skin had several scratches for the remainder of the night, on the brink of bleeding -this is a result of wearing the dress gently for 10-20 minutes while trying it on.","The dress itself was beautiful and was in clean condition, I assume is the case with all garments ordered from RTR.","I would rent from RTR again and hope for a better experience."
"6.0","Great dress for work.","Chic, professional and a great color!"
"6.0","I wore this to my sister-in-laws bridal shower.","It was a nice daytime dress but not something I would probably rent again.","This is definitely a dress made for someone with no curves.","Not so flattering for an hourglass figure.","I was a little surprised that though it looks free flowing it was still fairly fitted at the hips.","The picture online makes it look like it is a loose fit, but it was definitely a little snug.","Sizing up is a good idea."
"6.0","The dress was unfortunately too long and I had to hold it up the entire night.","Other than that it was a nice dress."
"6.0","This top runs so large that I couldnt even wear it.","Like, it wasnt even close.","3 stars for the quality."
"6.0","Man, this dress is pretty.","Not as form-fitting as Id like (pretty stretchy--even the 0 is a hair roomy on me), but overall, its fine.","Still, what is with this bunching in the front?","Maybe its because of my size--Im pretty petite with a shorter torso and longer legs--but this just seems like such a structural faux pas to me.","I mean, I can live with it, especially since these days, returning a dress to RTR is less intuitive than ever, but if youre at all self-conscious about your pooch, especially if youre a shorty like me, skip this dress.","From the front and back, youll love it.","But from the side...just not forgiving at all."
"6.0","This dress was beautiful for the event and I received a lot of compliments.","My only complaints were it was a little shorter than I would have liked and it was a little tight and not true to size.","The 8L would have been perfect if it wasnt damaged.","3 days before the event I was told that it couldnt arrive.","I choose nude strap sandals and the color is rose gold."
"6.0","The dress is beautiful!","I was sooooo excited about this dress!","The only drawback for me is that the arms were tiny!","I do Cross fit and Olympic lifting, so I was really sad when there was no way the sleeves would go over my arms.","Just a heads up, if you like to lift, this dress is probably not the best fit.","Oh well!"
"6.0","Dress ran a little big.","The fitting in the body was a little loose.","I have long legs and normally need longer sizes but this dress was swimming on me.","I recommend the regular unless you are VERY tall and going down a size from you normal selection."
"6.0","As advertised this is a trapeze dress, so if you were hoping to define your waist get a belt.","The waist was also below my true waist so I didnt think it complimented my body very well.","That being said, it is a pretty color and would be fun for dancing."
"6.0","I wore this to a casual NYE get together.","I was also 12 weeks pregnant, so it was stretchy enough to hug my new curves even though I didnt have a belly yet.","I was deciding between the 42 and 44.","I would have loved the 44 as it had just a smidgen more breathing room, but it was significantly longer than the 42.","If I was going to a work event, I would have worn the 44.","But for a party, I went with the 42 and wore sheer black tights.","(Im 56 and the 42 fell just below my butt, and the 44 fell almost to my knees.)","Overall a very pretty dress but I wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","Rented for prom for daughter but would work for loads of other formal events - classic dress.","Daughter did not end up wearing it though, because she felt it was not going to be comfortable to move in for the evening.","Form fitting as the picture indicates so movement is indeed limited!!","She ended up wearing a BCBG dress a friend had that was super comfortable and equally as glamorous.","This dress though is great for someone who wants to feel sleek and smooth curves a bit.","My daughter is very slim so was not an issue for her but worth mentioning."
"6.0","cute dress for summer but does run big.","also like the other reviewers mentioned it does show a lot of side boob without the right undergarment.","also true of what other pear shaped reviews mentioned of can be unflattering at some angles depending on how you move.","i wore it with some strappy sandals and a light drapey black cardigan to go with the boho vibe.","cute weekend look for the spring/summer and fun rental as the back floated when i walked.","wouldnt buy, but cute for a rental for a casual saturday look."
"6.0","I loved the color on the dress but the top was much thinner than I thought it would be.","The material was very stretchy but the beads felt like they were going to unravel at any moment.","Luckily they didnt and I had a great night!","It was a good length for tall girls but the waist was a little high.","But it still worked."
"6.0","This is a gorgeous dress.","Truly.","The fabric is stunning and shifts colors depending on the light from gold to dark green.","The halter top is flattering as well.","The length is great, too, but the fabric itself is not forgiving for those of us that are curvy.","I wear a 36C bra and it was tight around the ribcage (as most designer dresses are) and in the waist area despite a shaping garment.","I might have sized up but I didnt get a backup size for this dress.","In any case, it was nice to get a free upgrade to this dress."
"6.0","Gorgeous dress - wish I could have worn it.","Length would have been perfect.","Note to the pregnant ladies out there:  bump friendly is a limited term.","This dress is probably bump friendly up to about 28 weeks or so.","It is not super-friendly to late-term bumps.","I was 36 weeks and was disappointed that the zipper would not close.","The fabric has very little give.","That said, RTR has excellent customer service, and I was pleased with the response I received when I called about neither dress fitting.","Would definitely use RTR again (just not when Im so pregnant!",")."
"6.0","I wore this to Easter we went to church and then brunch.","I thought the color was amazing however I wore the smallest size and it was to bagy.","I also felt like it was a little short."
"6.0","This is a beautiful dress.","However, I ordered a 2 and a 0.","Only the 2 came.","I needed the 0 and the 2 was too big for my frame.","Its very elegant, classic and lovely.","However, I feel it would fit a larger busted woman or a more curvy woman better.","It was simply too much dress for me."
"6.0","Goofy photo from my husbands party, but shows most of the dress.","I got compliments and I liked the sequins but I wasnt a fan of the cut.","I have a short-ish waist and I prefer sheath to empire and this was close but more empire than I wanted.","I wore a 4 which fit fine in the top but the skirt portion just wasnt cut well for me and not particularly flattering I didnt think.","It is less fitted in the skirt and sort of flares out at the waist in a non-beneficial way.","The length was fine about mid-thigh and age appropriate.","The sequins were scratchy on the arms a bit but nothing that was a deal breaker.","You need a helper to zip it up for sure as one functional note.","Overall it was fine but I wouldnt wear it again which makes me SO glad it was just a rented dress."
"6.0","This dress did not hit me correctly.","Not the best dress if you are tall"
"6.0","This is a beautiful coat with a cool vibe but it runs large and that combined with boxy style just didnt work for me.","I sent it back without wearing because I was drowning in it."
"6.0","I ordered both the small and medium..","The difference between the small and medium were pretty significant it makes me question if I received an extra small instead of a small.","I ended up wearing the medium.","The sleeves were really long, I had to tuck them under.","Overall, the dress was just okay.","I probably wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","Ran super small.","No stretch.","wasnt a fan of the cut"
"6.0","Its a beautiful dress but I would not rent this style again as this style is not for me.","This was a back up dress as the one I wanted wasnt available.","Normally, I steer away from wrap dresses as I have a small bust (34A/B), broad shoulders, and my torso is longer, meaning my natural waist and where the waist on the dress are, never fit.","Sure enough, neither of the sizes fit me very well.","The size 4 was way too small in the shoulders as the material does not have any stretch, the arms fit well though.","I wore the size 6 and it was OK in the shoulders, big on the arms but I could not raise my arms beyond enough to bring my fork to my mouth.","The bust was way too big, I had to pin it twice and the waist hit me entirely in the wrong spot.","My torso ended up looking lumpy.","In the end, I decided to go with it, as I didnt have any other options and figured the venue I was at would be dark so it wouldnt be that big of a deal."
"6.0","This dress was fine, but not delightful as so many of the other dresses have been in terms of fit and flattering.","i think it might work better on a different shape, i am petite and curvy."
"6.0","I felt like I was swimming in this dress.","It was shapeless and unflattering.","I tried to use the side belts, but it only made the dress gape at the buttons."
"6.0","low cut but it didnt bother me"
"6.0","This dress was a beautiful, bright color and I loved it.","The only thing that was an issue was in the chest area.","A regular bra didnt work with it, and I felt like it made my boobs look strange when I wore it with a sticky bra.","Loved the color but the fit wasnt very flattering on me."
"6.0","This dress was cuter on than on the hanger.","Initially I was like woah... it looks like grandmas Christmas ornaments.","Im usually a 4 and I went with the 2 which was a perfect fit except everywhere but the shoulders (expected I have broad muscular arms).","I felt the dress aged me a bit given the design and conservative cut.","I would save this for a family gathering or party instead of a holiday party in the city.","Waist is itchy, beware!","Not the most comfortable dress since the fabric is very heavily embroidered and thick.","Pros: No wrinkles, unique stand-out design, conservative but short enough to not age you too much."
"6.0","I rented this dress for my fiances annual work formal.","I was excited for this dress but ended up not wearing it due to some construction issues.","Pros: color!","; overall shape -the bell sleeves are very on trend; great length.","Cons:  the one very big con is that the front top of the dress constantly rolls down, not falls down but rolls down, and this messes with the whole shape and look of the dress.","This is a fitted dress so the bottom layer is tight and rides up.","The top layer is not connected to the bottom and does not ride up in the same way; it falls more normally.","These 2 factors cause the top layer to keep moving down while the bottom layer moves up, creating that rolled down issue at the neckline.","Overall, this dress is great in theory but the execution is poor.","I am sad to say that I would not recommend this dress."
"6.0","The material didnt seem to be as shiny as it looks in the pictures, which is neither positive or negative.","My only issue was that the wires were sticking out of the bottom and poking me!","This is probably only true of the particular garment I was sent, not all dresses, but might be worth checking with the store before you order it.","Otherwise, it really is a gorgeous dress!"
"6.0","The dress was very pretty w/ a nice floral detail.","However, docking two stars because the top/shoulders fit very strange.","There was too much fabric to tie it as seen in the model photo because it bunched up very weird but when left untied, again too much fabric so it kept slipping off my shoulders and became a hassle all night.","Would probably work better for someone with a fuller bust who can fill out the fabric more or be prepared to use fashion tape to keep the shoulders in place."
"6.0","I rented this as my back-up dress, and would say it just felt ok on.","This dress looked fine, and I probably would have worn if my first choice didnt work out so well (The Rachel Roy Good Karma Sheath), but this actually made my bottom half look bigger, which I wasnt expecting with the looser fit.","I actually asked two men for their opinion and they gave the, Its okay/didnt seem that impressed response.","Dressed up with heels and jewelry, though, and it could have worked."
"6.0","The dress is short, which would be fine, but because the shoulders are also very tight, I couldnt move my arms.","Should have gone with a size six.","The fabric is somewhat worn and pilled."
"6.0","Pros: comfortable and you can wear a regular bra.","Cons: a little longer than I wanted and scratchy under the arms.","If you can get past those things this is a fabulous dress and worth the rental!"
"6.0","Wasnt too crazy about this dress but got multiple compliments.","Very low cut in the front and a little short on my 6 frame.","Was loose in some areas and tight in others making it not as flattering as expected on my athletic body type."
"6.0","I wore these pants with a black tank.","They are high-waisted and pretty comfortable but know the material wrinkles very easily.","I have a small waist and the waistband JUST fit.","Also, there is A LOT of material in the pleating, including on the sides at the hips; PLUS there are pockets, so if youre trying to hide your hips, this is probably not the way to go (also, they were a bit hot).","They were cute and fun, but probably wont get again because I felt that I looked too wide."
"6.0","This dress is really pretty but as a 54 hourglass figure, it didnt fit me well at all.","It was perfect at the waist but the top was huge and way too long.","Much better suited for someone who is taller or who at least has a longer torso."
"6.0","I loved the material of this dress - very cozy.","However, the proportions seemed off and it wasnt the most flattering.","I guess I have a shorter torso because the waist was dropped.","That left extra material in the natural waist section - enough that I could have rolled it if I wanted to.","I was constantly checking the waist and readjusting all night to make sure it didnt look bad.","I wouldnt rent again."
"6.0","Worn to Roaring 20s-themed university formal.","I got lots of compliments on this dress, but overall wouldnt rent again.","The fabric on the dress looked a bit worn, though Im sure most folks couldnt notice that.","The waist of the dress is tight and cinched in an unflattering way (covered in photo by strategic hand placement).","However, I have a pretty straight figure.","For folks with a more natural hourglass figure, it may be more flattering.","I was able to wear it without a bra, which was great given the neckline.","Worn with nude heels, pearl jewelry, silver 1920s-style headpiece, silver-toned eye make-up, and red lipstick."
"6.0","I was unable to wear this dress - when zipped the bust was entirely too tight, waist and hips had ample room, there is zero stretch in the material.","34DD is way to large, best guess is anything beyond a B maybe C is not going to work.","Shame, the rest of the dress looked amazing."
"6.0","Im a pear shape and I went up a size for this dress to a 6R.","While I could get this dress on and it looked good - it was difficult to walk and it was IMPOSSIBLE to sit with this dress on because the underslip was so tight on my hips and seat.","Because of the skirt that covers the underskirt, no one could tell but I decided I couldnt wear this because I would be so uncomfortable in this dress.","I am a 32B and if I had gone up to an 8 the chest would have been extremely large in the top (the 6 was more loose than I like already).","I would not recommend this dress for a pear shape."
"6.0","This is a great dress, wonderful materials and a fun flare at the bottom.","It fit well, but it needs to be dressed up a bit.","Id recommend renting alongside some fun jewelry or high heels to set the tone."
"6.0","This was my back-up dress.","I never wear long dresses as im quite short but thought i would give this one a shot.The dress itself is really nice, was very itchy on the chest and back area though.","The length was perfect.","This dress made me look quite wide at the top and was a little large so had to keep pulling it up."
"6.0","Im 6 foot and i bought this dress in long and it was almost TOO long for me flat footed!","Overall the dress was beautiful but the zipper was a war in it self.","I think I stressed more about the problems of the dress rather than actually enjoying it!"
"6.0","I normally wear a size four or six in petites, but I ordered the equivalent of a size two in this dress, and I was swimming in it.","Not only was it too long, but the shoulders were too wide, and the body of the dress was a lot baggier than I wanted it to be."
"6.0","Not the sexiest romper, but comfortable and fun for vacation."
"6.0","This dress is so beautiful!","The pattern is even more beautiful in person.","It is very fitted in through the waist and leg but bigger on top and in the arms.","I am a 32A and it was too loose on top and also through the arms.","Its also a little difficult to walk in because there is no slit.","I did not end up wearing it to my event but I loved getting to see it in person, its a gorgeous dress."
"6.0","I loved it, but it was a little large and loose fitting.","True to size for a medium though!","I would have loved to have ordered a size small but it was unavailable at the time."
"6.0","This dress is the ideal color for a Christmas event and it really catches the eye.","The fit was perfect and it was reasonably comfortable for a lace dress.","I gave it 3 stars mostly because the lace looked worn, especially around the top and collar.","You also definitely will need another person around to hook the top back hooks.","I worn this to a formal dinner with black pumps and black pashmina.","Didnt need any bra, but Im small.","As always, RTR service is the best."
"6.0","The bust fits weird, its very baggy"
"6.0","I wore this dress for NYE and thought it was great!","The straps kept slipping down so I ended up tucking them into the dress and going strapless."
"6.0","Ran a bit large for Herve- I was able to zip it up by myself which I never can for Herve smalls, and the bust was very loose.","Not the nicest pattern either."
"6.0","I rented this to wear on air for work.","Color is a beautiful rich red but the neckline and bow ended up looking a little clunky and made me a look a little bigger than I am.","Also, spanx are a must and even then, every bra strap or lady lump may be visible.","I think this is best for leaner, smaller busted women."
"6.0","pros- beautiful color, dresscon- too small"
"6.0","I rented this dress for New Years Eve.","I didnt want a long gown, but by the time I started looking on the site most everything I liked better was already rented.","I decided I would go with this one as it was one of only a few left with sequins and it would likely be warmer on what was forecast to be a horribly frigid NYE.","It was pretty comfortable, however lifting my arms up was pretty much not an option.","It fit well, but was too short to be as slimming as Id hoped.","I ended up wearing kitten heels with it to make it less noticeable, which was nice in the end because I was able to stand and dance for longer periods of time.","I only got one compliment from a girl in the line for the restroom.","Overall, it was okay."
"6.0","While I loved the styling and full bolero feeling, I wasnt prepared for the fact that there is a black on black floral design on the main body of the piece.","It felt a little too much like upholstery fabric for my taste & style.","Could be great for other people.","My recommendation would be to really zoom in it to make sure that is what youre after...."
"6.0","I just thought this was okay- wasnt super flattering like all of the other dresses I have worn by this designer... the colors are fun though."
"6.0","This was my 2nd choice dress.","I got so many complements at the wedding but just wish it was a little more form fitting.","I felt like the 0 was too small and the 2 was just a little too big.","I also ended up wearing a shoe with a kitten heel because it was a little too short as well (didnt have time to return it for a long but would highly recommend a long if youre taller than me).","Over all the dress was pretty I just was not overall happy with the cut."
"6.0","I wore this for about a week but once temperatures got into the low 50s I found myself shivering in this coat and sent it back.","Its cute, but its just not that warm.","However, the collar is nice and if you flip it up, its good for blocking the wind.","I got the small which was a bit boxy, but I dont think an XS would work because it would have been too short in the arms.","Also, the zipper was kind of a pain, so this wasnt my favorite coat."
"6.0","The dress was cute, however, as others have commented the material is not forgiving.","I would recommend go up a size."
"6.0","This sweatshirt is cute.","Can be worn for work or play.","It stretched out throughout the day which is why I gave it three stars.","Im not sure I would rent again but if I did Id size down."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful, but unfortunately did not fit great.","As others noted, the straps were too long and hung in the back.","Im 52 and it was also longer in length than I would have wanted for a cocktail dress.","The plus side was that from the front it looked very nice (aside from the modest length), so the pictures look nice!"
"6.0","Beautiful dress!","I am usually a 4p.","I ordered a 4p.","It is very flattering.","I would have felt more comfortable in a 6R.","The petite was too short.","For those reasons I did not wear it.","If you are over 5ft and want to wear heels then I recommend a regular length."
"6.0","This dress fit perfectly in all the right places, but it was WAY to short!","I ended up wearing the backup that RTR sent me and Im so glad they did!","Im 56, 125 lbs and the dress was up to the tops of my ankles with 3 heels on."
"6.0","The dress was very full from the silky lining underneath which was nice, but makes you look heavier on the bottom half.","I didnt like the way the lace looked in real life either.","Decided not to wear it."
"6.0","Beautiful dress but too long for me.","I usually wear an 8 but had to wear the 10 for the waist (I have an athletic build.","Dress is best suited for someone much taller than 52"
"6.0","This dress runs a little tight in the waist but is otherwise true to size.","I didnt end up wearing to a fall wedding because it looked to summery.","I would recommend it for a warm weather event."
"6.0"," This dress runs extremely small.","I typically can wear a two and six fit me.","It is super fitted, well constructed a beautiful color.","I actually did not end up wearing it to the wedding however as it was 95° and the stress was much too thick and hot to wear to something like that."
"6.0","The dress fit perfectly and color was gorgeous.","I loved the higher neckline.","I ended up not wearing it however because the armholes were cut to show more of the front part of my shoulder than I wanted to show at this event.","The cut was similar to a tank top on the sides.","Just a little too casual for this event."
"6.0","The dress is cut higher in back than it is in the front, making the rear view extremely work-inappropriate for anyone 56 or taller.","Tried it on and sent it back right away."
"6.0","The dress is a beautiful color and a great fabric, but the fit was really unusual.","I often have difficult with some clothes since I have a 27inch back but larger boobs so I dont usually comment on fit, but this dress was so off that I imagine well-proportioned people will still have issues.","Im usually a 4/6 and I got this in a 4 and it HUNG off my top half.","The straps were way too long that there was serious gaping around my armpits from the excess fabric.","To make the dress flattering, I considered pinning back the straps, but to do so sufficiently...","I literally had fistfuls of fabric in both hands, I mean seriously who is this designed for?","6ft7 women with ridiculously long torsos??","Plus the skirt section cuts a bit too high, so its above your hips, giving a bit of an unflattering form.","Really hoped I could have worn this since the color was so great.","It also was way too long on me, came down to my knees.","I know 53 is small but come on...","So I definitely would not recommend this for petite ladies!"
"6.0","felt way too big"
"6.0","It was a bit disappointing.","I went up in size because I wanted the oversized jacket (it is funky in the shoulder area) - look.","I guess if I gave it more time/another try, I could think of different ways to make use of it.","I dont consider this an everyday sort of piece.","Good for cooler weather; think early to mid fall and mid spring."
"6.0","This dress was a little loose.","It was a really pretty color but Id size down."
"6.0","This top is super cute and flattering when looking at it head-on.","However, for someone with a large chest, its a bit tricky.","So much side boob!","If you can find the right cami or bra, it would be fine, but with the open back, I didnt have anything that would really work."
"6.0","just an okay fit- i didnt find this particularly flattering.","nothing bad, just nothing amazing"
"6.0","I couldnt get this dress out of my head when I saw it - so unique and pretty.","As others have said, it is more sequiny than it looked in the picture.","I didnt realize all the black was sequins.","That didnt really matter though.","I got the 4 and the 6, and I think I am just in between sizes.","The 4 was more figure flattering, but a bit too short.","I would have worn the 4 if I decided to wear tights but it was a nice day - I needed the extra length of the 6 to go without tights.","Overall, it was okay, but not my favorite shape.","Oh - and the sequins did not scratch my arms!","No issue with that."
"6.0","arms ran very small"
"6.0","Cute romper.","A little tight in the hips and thighs but its a nice print and a good length that I felt comfortable in.","I didnt wear it off the shoulder and it worked really well."
"6.0","Loved the dress, but didnt end up wearing bc of the length.","I am only 52 and it was short on me.","If it had been winter I would def worn it with tights and boots."
"6.0","I only liked and didnt love this dress.","My husband said I looked fantastic, but I thought the waist hit just a little bit higher than my natural waist, which kept the fit from being just right.","Overall a very comfy dress to wear.","The pockets meant I didnt have to drag a clutch with me to the wedding.","Im long waisted, so someone with a shorter torso probably wouldnt have a problem with where the waist of the dress hit."
"6.0","Im short and I was worried about the length of the dress but really THAT wasnt the problem.","Its the torso part, its a bit loose for me.","Probably would have fit better if I was taller or maybe this dress just doesnt compliment petite body type."
"6.0","The color is gorgeous and the dress is very well made.","However, I was looking for something to cover up my post-baby tummy and my larger than normal chest.","It wasnt super flattering on a very large chest, I should have chosen something with a higher waist.","Because of where the waist falls, it tends to add all over bulk because theres so much draping on the top.","If youre more proportional this dress would probably work better, but if youre carrying all of your weight up top this isnt a good fit.","Also - the shapewear I bought showed as the shoulders are more inset than I realized - not a huge problem, but since the dress was a little bit big [I should have chosen the next smaller size] I just went without the shapewear!"
"6.0","Really pretty dress and loved the metallic detail in the pattern, but because I am slim, the size that fit the majority of my body was way too tight near my neck and chest.","I wore a different dress instead."
"6.0","Small; hard to get into and has shoulder pads!"
"6.0","I loved the color of this dress!","However, it did not fit me very well.","It was a little bit loose up top but the sheath underneath was very tight through the hips.","If I had gone up a size to fit the hips, the top would have been huge on me.","I made it work but wish I had read the other reviews before I ordered because this seems like a common problem for this dress with a pear body type."
"6.0","I love DVF and this romper is pretty but I am 59 with heels and this was still super long.","Also even with a safety pin it was hard to keep closed in the front.","Work it to a work party and while pretty, I was happy to return it."
"6.0","Beautiful dress, but fit weird in the stomach and but area.","Id go a size up from what you normally wear."
"6.0","This didnt fit very well for my 54 body.","It bunched up on my waist area because its meant to be for people with longer upper bodies.","If the upper part was adjustable then perhaps it would have fit me, but it didnt.","Id only recommend this if you have a long upper body or tall."
"6.0","I was pretty disappointed with this dress.","The top half fit perfectly, but the bottom was loose and bunched up awkwardly because the fabric is supposed to be tight.","Also, the zipper sticks out, which wasnt really an issue but I definitely expected better quality for what it cost."
"6.0","The skirt fits a bit smaller than the rest of the dress.","The pockets are also set too far back to be useful.","It was nice, but felt a little uncomfortable on."
"6.0","Super low cut - I had to layer over a shirt or I couldnt have worn it out of the house."
"6.0","This laces design is beautiful; however, it is very stiff and I can tell it would have definitely itched by the end of the night.","I did not like the fit at all on me as it made my shoulders and arms look huge.","Returned without wearing.","."
"6.0","Great dress but wasnt for me.","I tried on and sent back.","I am broad shouldered and felt that the arms were too tight and I didnt care for the the feel of the high and tight collar on my neck.","Also, the dress seems to ride up some."
"6.0","Loved the bright cheerful color and the deep pockets.","A bit high-waisted for me as I have a long torso.","To the knee on me 5ft 7.","Very work appropriate."
"6.0","Fit was incredible and the dress was beautiful but I was burning up!","It was a lot thicker than I expected, so an outside shower in August was not exactly the best place for it!","Looked great though:)"
"6.0","Very low in the back/side.","Can not wear with a bra."
"6.0","A lot heavier than I would have thought.","Would be good for a winter white, but too thick for a summer party in my opinion.","The details are pretty and the fit was perfect.","Just not what I expected."
"6.0","I personally thought this coat was trendy, sporty and fun.","Ive been tons of cropped velvet/fur coats in stores and on my Insta feed.","My husbands reaction was you look like a hampster!","Note, he doesnt follow fashion but I still care about his opinion.","Needless to say, I didnt wear this around him!"
"6.0","I loved this dress, and the size 10 fit perfectly with my size 10 bottom, but the top...","I couldnt wear it.","Im small on top and I could have fit my entire arm inside the top of the dress.","You need big boobs to pull this off, or you need to size down (which I couldnt do, thanks to my butt).","This dress would be perfect for a fashionable curvy girl."
"6.0","Not for pear bodies!","Was constantly pulling up the top (small bust) and about to burst the bottom (big booty).","I thought it looked okay head on in the mirror but later saw photos where I looked like a Kardashian and not in a good way..."
"6.0","This dress fit great and is very flattering.","I did receive several compliments, HOWEVER, the cut outs at the bottom caused some problems.","First of all, it is impossible to wear pantyhose with this dress (which I must wear in my office).","The cut outs snagged an ran my hose with each step.","When I got off work, I removed the hose to run errands and the cut outs scratched up my legs.","Very uncomfortable!"
"6.0","Odd stitching on the dress that cant be seen in the picture.","Loved that it had pockets, but it also has pockets on the chest...cant really notice them, but interesting.","Did not end up wearing as was too tight in the waist area.","and no give in the fabric If you have larger breasts, would not recommend as the fabric gaps on the side."
"6.0","So there are a few reasons this dress didnt work out for me.","First off, the fabric is really weird--it almost feels like waterproof material like something that you would make a poncho or raincoat out of.","As a result despite the skirt having structural details its actually pretty flimsy and floppy.","Second, the 42 was just large enough that there was no shape to the dress so I looked a bit like a parachute (esp with the fabric) but fit just well enough that a smaller size would be a no go.","Another reason I wouldnt size down is because the actual hole for your head is so small and uncomfortable, I had to pretzel manuever myself out of it"
"6.0","there is just not a lot of shape going on here.","I am 59 about 130 lbs and pretty straight and narrow.","Just looked like a box on me.","With the right curves this could be gorgeous.","i would rent a size down maybe to help with this problem"
"6.0","i loved the color and fit however, i had to continually pull up the tube top because it would not stay up."
"6.0","I loved the color and simple elegance of the dress, but I couldnt wear it due to how low cut the dress is.","For my 34D bust, there was no way to use doubled sided tape to make this dress appropriate for the black tie event I was attending.","The v cut was open to the bottom of my natural bra line, and  tape on the lightweight fabric of this dress just doesnt work well.","I couldnt close the gap and make it possible to  prevent gaping and revealing way too much.","This was my first Rent the Runway.","I was very pleased with how simple they make it.","Dress arrived on time, still with tags, and was simple to return.","Ill be back but will try to be wiser with my choices."
"6.0","Not worth the money."
"6.0","Its a little loose up top around the waist, which I felt added bulk to my top half.","The pleating does not go all the way around.","I couldnt tell if that was the design, or if it had been worn too much and the pleats have fallen.","The length was great and I could have worn 2-3 heels and been fine in it."
"6.0","This dress was adorable, but not the most comfortable.","I am 58 and I wore a 6, and it was extremely difficult to sit down.","Luckily I was on the side of the table facing the wall and no one could see anything.","It is extremely neon pink, which I didnt mind, but prepare to be surprised.","The material is forgiving, but the arms can be a bit tight.","I received a ton of compliments!"
"6.0","It fit but it felt like a straight jacket.","Its a lot of thick material and just feels like too much.","Runs pretty true to size.","Definitely more off white/beige than it appears"
"6.0","The sleeves are very long, which make it a little awkward.","It also starts to choke you by the end of the way, particularly when you are sitting down and the dress pulls at your neck."
"6.0","I love this, but it was too tight across my hips to wear.","I ordered my normal size because the reviews said it was roomy in the hips."
"6.0","top is a little on the shorter side and im not tall at all"
"6.0","I typically wear a 10 and get a 12 for backup.","This dress runs very, very small.","I could barely get the 12 on and would have needed a 14.","My roommate you is a size 6 tried on the 10 and it fit her perfectly.","Luckily, I ordered another dress and it worked out great."
"6.0","I wish I could say I had a better photo to share of the dress, but both its color and style are absolutely stunning!","The fuller skirt creates the illusion of hips that I dont necessarily need, so I would recommend it more for straighter body types.","As other reviewers have mentioned, its length comes up a bit high, but at 58, I didnt feel that it was uncomfortable throughout the day.","Although I dont believe I would rent the dress again, it was perfect for the occasion!"
"6.0","didnt wear it too small"
"6.0","This dress is impossible to zip up by yourself (my big bust may have contributed to that problem though).","Once I got it zipped it fit pretty good.","The regular was a bit long.","I had to wear 4 heals and being as graceful as I am, thats a bit scary.","Also, there was a nasty body odor smell on both dresses I received.","Had to drown it in my perfume (sorry RTR).","But after all that, I still wore it and had a blast at our New Years Eve Ball!"
"6.0","I really loved this dress.","It was perfect for a September wedding in North Carolina mountains as it was warm enough for a chillier evening, but cool enough for the mid-afternoon outdoor ceremony.","The color was perfect and it DID fit me well.","However, Im pear shaped, with larger hips and a thinner upper body (think Kim K. or J-Lo).","With the fullness of the lower half of the dress, I felt it made me a feel a little frumpy since I wore flats with it (it was an outdoor wedding, didnt want to sink into the grass in heels).","Its a beautiful dress, but if youre self-conscious about a bigger booty/hips, Id recommend something different.","Thats the only reason I give it three stars.","Great dress, just not my favorite look for my body type."
"6.0","Size up.","I wear between a 2 and 4 and the size 4 was tight.","This is a dress that has no give and is hard to move in.","Dont wear it for a dancing event.","It was okay- nothing special.","I wouldnt rent it again."
"6.0","Very pretty dress - will fit differently on everyone.","I was very happy in the end, but also could have found a more flattering dress on the site.","Was also VERY long!"
"6.0","The fabric is very soft but also stretchy and thin making it super clingy.","The top is loose which worked, but the bottom is very tight and shows everything.","Good style if you want to show off, but not for me."
"6.0","Really stood out in pictures.","The place I picked out for my bday was dark.","So I wanted a white dress.","I sized up frighten by the reviews about how tight it was.","I ordered a 6, 8.","(normally Im a 4, 6) I wouldnt of minded trying a 4.","The black band under the boobs is where its tight, so going up a size, the waist got longer, and in an 8 maybe even tighter, as it hit me on a bigger spot my tum tum.","I wore the 6 but even so, the top looked a little big (im more of a 4 on top).","Im not sure if the 4 would of fit my middle but wish I would of given in a try.","The dress it self is adorable.","There is a little milly signature on it, but it is showing some wear, I tried steamed it a bit, which made the skirt look fluff up a bit.","Overall it was perfect for my bday.","But Im glad I can return it, since the pattern is so bold...people would remember if I wore it again.","Great rental.","I wore silver jewelry, and wore both black flats and later heels.","I thought both looked nice."
"6.0","I was so excited to get this piece but wasnt able to wear it because it was too big up top.","The top kept falling and the opening was right at my cleavage not above, so it showed nearly everything.","I didnt end up trying a size smaller, so I cant comment on whether the issue would be fixed with a more snug size.","The back is beautiful and the way the fabric lays just below the shoulders is really nice."
"6.0","Im 52, wore 3 inch heals and the dress still rested on the floor.","Had to hold it up while walking and stairs were a challenge.","It was a beautiful dress, just not good for someone my height."
"6.0","Fun and glitzy, but too short like most Badgley Mischka items, Ive found.","Im 55 and this just touched the top of my feet.","Its not tapered enough to look right that short.","My friend whos much shorter than me wore it instead and it looked cute on her!"
"6.0","The fabric is pretty stretchy which allows a great fit.","I didnt love the fabric.","The quality was less than I expected.","I had a primary dress that I ended up wearing, but this would have worked if I needed it to."
"6.0","I wanted so badly to love this dress like everyone else does!","The fit was true to size at my waist and hips, but I really struggled with the neckline of this dress.","Im simultaneously high-waisted and small-chested, so there was simply too much fabric above my waist.","I wasnt able to find a way around this issue even though this dress is adjustable, theoretically fitting anyone.","Coupled with the dresss plunging neckline, this situation drove me to wear a scarf over the dress in case of a wardrobe malfunction.","But you dont have the high waist + small chest phenomenon going on, then definitely rent this dress -- its beautifully made and it seems to fit everyone else out there."
"6.0","I love the collar and the lace detailing of the fabric, however, the dress is a bit tight especially in the bust/ chest area, making it hard to zip up in the back.","Otherwise, this is a nice piece for everyday, though it is a bit short for my work (about 4-5 inches above my knees)."
"6.0","The sleeves are very long.","Not a great option for a dinner, youll be fighting to keep the ties out of your plate!","Super soft and adorable print."
"6.0","Beautiful dress.","Arrived in excellent condition.","Wore the same designer on Easter.","However with this type of dress if you have a large bust you must go up a size."
"6.0","I was ready to love this dress - it was my first RTR rental, and I was so psyched to wear it to all 3 weekend events (bday party, bridal shower, formal auction event) thanks to its versatility.","The fabric is very comfortable, silky smooth, and breathable.","Be prepared to tug at the bottom of it, as it comes up all the time.","The sleeves kept coming off, too.","I loved the open back, and enjoyed the compliments - I received many, but it was too much work, I couldnt relax from all the fixing."
"6.0","The sequins are much more obvious than shown in the photograph, I wasnt a big fan of it, but the back was breath-taking."
"6.0","This dress was really nice, would have loved to have worn it to work... if the fit was right.","I think because of my height the pockets ended up sitting in too low which resulted in two flares of the dress in lieu of the one."
"6.0","I didnt love this dress but it was completely my fault.","I didnt realize it was polka dots and Im not a polka dot gal!"
"6.0","I wore this for a night out on the town with a friend.","It was quite roomy, but it was a little big.","I typically fluctuate from a small to medium depending on the fabric, so I recommend erring on the smaller side.","I love rompers, and this one was long enough where I my thighs didnt rub together, which was nice for a change.","I liked the mesh material because in a club, where youre dancing and its hot, there was always a nice breeze, but there was never a time where I felt exposed.","I only gave it 3 stars because: 1.","It was so big that I had make shift safety pin the top because the girls were just hanging out all over the place, since it was not stitched until you reach the waist.","2.","It had very much a business type feel to it with shoulder pads, and seemed a little too formal for a night on the town.","Maybe Ill have a better experience getting a smaller size, but I wouldnt leap to rent this one again."
"6.0","I wanted something fun, yet conservative for the two events I was attending.","The pattern and sleeves are unique and the material is high quality.","But I am glad that it was cooler weather so I could get by with wearing tights because this dress is short and tight.","I am 5 10 and wear a size 10 with some wiggle room.","I could not even get the medium on my hips and the large was a bit snug.","Also, I do not recommend this dress if you will be doing a lot of sitting because it rides up a lot."
"6.0","A very tight dress, material does not stretch in the torso area, its a low A-line fit, loved it but totally ordered a M & L, just in case."
"6.0","Im a true pear shape.","I read another review from the same body type and she wrote that it was not flattering on her either.","Too tight in the arms/ bust and way too loose in the bottom which is rare to happen to me!","Usually its the other way around.","Wanted it to work but it was just not flattering at all."
"6.0","I will start off with the positive.","The A-line fit and flare of the bodice was flattering.","The asymetrical cut of the hem was beautiful.","I ended up not wearing either of the dresses (size 2 and 4) because the arm holes were a little awkward - not very flattering at all.","Material was substantial and you could absolutely wear a standard bra with the dress."
"6.0","Pros: beautiful color, sexy back, perfect style for a wedding.","Cons: the zipper was sticky and hard to zip up, which only made the issue that it was tight in the waist more problematic.","In the end, I still really enjoyed wearing the dress and was glad I ordered it, but probably wont again.","Also, I used a backless bra for this."
"6.0","I LOVED this dress, however the midsection was tight and the zipper had a difficult time going over this part of the dress.","I ended up not wearing it because I didnt want to break the zipper!"
"6.0","This dress was over-nighted to me by the ever gracious RTR team when my first choice didnt work out.","The dress is lovely...but LONG.","Oh so long.","I am 54, and this dress went down to my calves.","I wanted a fun party dress, and this would have been more appropriate for a formal social event.","I just couldnt wear this one either.","Beautiful material though!","This dress is a rich navy color, even though it looks black in the pictures.","There some seams on the outside that help contour the dress, much like boning.","It is a beautiful choice if you are looking for something on the conservative side."
"6.0","unfortunately, this dress was way too small.","I couldnt bend over in it, and I ended up wearing a different RTR dress."
"6.0","I couldnt wear even though it was so pretty on.","I could not get it on or off by myself and the arms are so restrictive it gave me anxiety-not comfy at all.","SO sad I couldnt wear it."
"6.0","Way too large in the chest.","I think it had somehow been stretched out even though it is sequins."
"6.0","fits well.","Looks better on the picture.","Very average dress, I ended up not wearing it."
"6.0","This looked much prettier online when I was adding to my Unlimited queue.","My shape is athletic and I have some muscles in shoulders, lats and this was tight across the back (size 4).","Nice length, though.","Wrinkles from original mailing didnt seem to fall out.","Not worth wearing more than once."
"6.0","The dress was so pretty, but not very functional.","I felt like I was constantly tugging it down and adjusting the shoulders.","I am 55 and it was really short on me.","I used fashion tape to keep the shoulders/back on.","I wouldnt recommend it for a wedding if you planned on dancing.","It would probably work for an event where you stood or sat the entire time."
"6.0","not for petite people.","The waist was super high and the crotch super low.","Im usually a medium but it ended up swallowing me.","Needless to say, I had to return.","Also, its a very soft material, almost like corduroy."
"6.0","Got lots of compliments, but didnt feel like the dress was that flattering becasue of the heavy fabric.","Im also very busty and it was appropriate, could have shown more cleavage."
"6.0","This dress was cute enough for walking around the neighborhood, but felt pretty large.","Its great for a hot day when you dont want anything touching you, but I wouldnt wear regularly."
"6.0","The dress was beautiful, however, the bust was very low and too loose for me (34B).","This dress is ideal for someone with a small waist and large bust."
"6.0","Not flattering on a hippy girl..."
"6.0","This is a sub brand under Kate Spade and maybe that is why it ran much smaller than other Kate Spades dresses I have worn in the past.","It was cute but I  needed a large."
"6.0","I rented this for Easter, fully intending to wear the 8, however that was too big up top.","So, I went with the 6 because it didnt gap in the back, but it was tight in the waist.","What can I say?","I have a large waist after having a baby.","This is my life now...","The dress is cute, but not super forgiving in the waist.","It also did this thing where it would bunch up in the middle when I sat down.","While I was standing, it was a dream though.","Thats why I gave it 3 stars."
"6.0","This dress was cute, but it was an awkward length for my height.","Not spectacular."
"6.0","beautiful dress, it has a small train, makes you feel like you are going to the Oscars, however it was not for my body type"
"6.0","This dress was really pretty.","It was my first option for a black tie wedding but ended up wearing my second option instead.","Although it is overall true to size, for me in the stomach and hip area it ran sort of big which made me look a little square and I wanted something more form -fitting.","I do have slightly broader shoulders than hips.","It looks totally great on camera but up close the lace on top may look a little bit worn.","It is a very lovely shade of blue (dark oxford blue) and is super comfortable for sitting and dancing.","I am 56 so the 6L worn with 3 inch heels makes it long enough to cover your heels and graze the floor."
"6.0","I really liked this dress in pictures--mixed materials, fun print, etc.","but was underwhelmed in person.","The top was incredibly large (even with a 38D bust) and my bra kept showing all evening under my arms and at the neckline as the top slid around.","Fashion tape may have helped but I received this as a last minute back up and didnt anticipate the issue.","Skirt was really fund for twirling dancing but I couldnt raise my arms."
"6.0","the dress is colorful, very appropriate for spring.","the fabric is stretchy and very forgiving.","the only things are the sleeve caps are very roomy, and the lining bunches up as I sat down and got up so I had to constantly check myself in the mirror."
"6.0","Im usually a 4 or 6, the 6 wasnt available so I tried the 4, but even if it was, I think this would have been too short for my bridal shower.","Cute dress, but runs small and not necessarily appropriate for a more formal bridal shower."
"6.0","The fabric creases easily and the crinkles are pretty obvious in photos.","I had this dress pressed right before the event I attended, but once I sat down to put my shoes on and got back up, this dress was creased all over again, and the creases lasted through the evening."
"6.0","I was not a big fan of this dress and didnt end up wearing it.","It has a lot of pretty detail but runs short and tight.","Another issue I had was the lining, which is a grey heathered sweatshirt material.","It added a thickness to the dress.","My husband said it looked like a sorority party dress which wasnt what I was going for but it could be a cute dress for the right person/ occasion."
"6.0","Would be great for work but I would recommend going a size down."
"6.0","My sister ended up wearing it as it was too small for me.","Nice material and the swing of the bottom was a really nice touch.","No complaints other than I couldnt wear it!"
"6.0","The fit of this dress is way off.","The waist looks fitted in the photos but the XS was at least two sizes too big for me.","I wanted to love this dress and ended up wearing it with a belt but it definitely would look better if it just fit like it was supposed to.","The bust was also roomy, which is not a problem I usually have with clothes in this size."
"6.0","It fits nicely.","The fabric is a bit shiny.","It is fine."
"6.0","I usually wear a 2 or a 4, and the 2 fit like a glove.","I didnt end up wearing the dress, it was a backup order.","I would caution anyone ordering it with a larger bust, the chest was pretty snug on me and I have a smaller chest.","The one thing I wasnt thrilled with was that the dress is more purple than the picture presents.","The picture to me looks like a dark purple, with the sequins blending in.","The dress itself wasnt a darker purple, and the sequins were on the larger side and did stand out."
"6.0","I really liked this shirt and was looking forward to wearing it.","It didnt have a great fit for me.","I would definitely need to wear a bra and it wasnt comfortable so I ended up returning it right away."
"6.0","Its quite a bulky dress and overwhelmed my small frame.","The heavy sequin-encrusting, I think, is a love-it-or-hate-it thing.","I am very petite, with a narrow, straight-ish figure (T-shirt shoulder about 13) and proportionally thick arms and this dress made me look a bit chunky on top rather than flatteringly buxom.","The ribbing made the neckline a little too high for this size.","Neither my husband nor I liked the scratchiness of the sequins.","It was also a pain to zip up.","I had to go with the other dress in the end.","I think this might be a proportion issue as I can see from the pictures that the ladies with broader and taller frames than mine looked beautiful and glamorous in this dress."
"6.0","I am usually between a O and a 2 but this dress runs large.","I am short so maybe it would work for a taller person.","There was a lot of extra room in the shoulder/neck area.","Otherwise, Stretchy and comfortable.","Had to wear a cami under to be appropriate for work."
"6.0","I am 6 months postpartum and struggled finding a dress that would fit my mid section and my chest.","Im currently nursing so I still am rather large on top yet small on the bottom which makes dress finding a task.","This dress did great with that.","I did find the straps to be loose so I had to use tape to ensure my top half was covered and the zipper is a pain (had to have help to get in and out) but overall I liked the dress and would get again if a sparkly dresses was needed."
"6.0","This dress seemed to have ran 2 sizes too small.","I ordered a 14, and I am typically 12-14 in normal clothes, or XL, but as I order more dresses on this site I am realizing I am almost always a 14 or X; But this 14 was super tiny.","I think there was a 3-4 inch gap in the zipper, and it was smooshing my boobs down.","Now, it is REALLY pretty, but just not for my body type."
"6.0","it sort of irritated my arms w scratches but it was cute"
"6.0","The dress runs really small, Im almost always the smalls in any size and frequently even the smalls is usually a little loose on me, especially at the waist.","This dress was not the case.","I recommend only for tall and very stick, straight skinny figures."
"6.0","I rented this for a special birthday party.","Because I had read others descriptions of the tight sleeves, I rented a 6 as my backup size.","They were right!","The sleeves were ridiculously tight, and I do not have large arms.","The 6 felt a little better in that area , but the rest of the dress was too big, and made me appear bigger.","The 4 fit perfectly, but it was so uncomfortable in and under the arms that I wound up wearing a dress of my own instead.","Too bad; its a gorgeous dress and beautifully made, but so constricting up top!","I couldnt even come close to zipping it up by myself."
"6.0","I get that it is supposed to have a cozy, large fit, however, I would suggest sizing down 2 sizes.","It is comfortable and soft.","Not itchy.","Note that the yellow stitching on the end is more of a gold/marigold color than a bright yellow."
"6.0","I didnt wear this because it was too low cut for everyday wear.","Might be ok for a date though."
"6.0","The fit was just ok.","The bodice part was pretty long-if this dress came in a petite size it would have fit much better.","The torso portion was too long so it flared at an awkward part of my hips.","however, it wasnt too noticeable because of the pattern.","Otherwise, this is a very pretty dress and the material was great."
"6.0","Dress was still very pretty.","Perfect for fall/winter event."
"6.0","I rented this for everyday work, hoping to pair it with boots or flats as the season changes.","The fabric was VERY thin so it was not appropriate to wear until summer.","Maybe Ill give it another shot in July..."
"6.0","This top is gorgeous.","I ended up not being able to wear it because it was tight that I couldnt get it over my C cup bust.","I would recommend sizing up for any gals with a C cup or larger."
"6.0","I rented this for a NYE wedding and it was a beautiful color and in great condition, but it was too small and wouldnt zip past my hips."
"6.0","Pros: Beautiful in pictures!","The shape of the dress was mostly flattering.","I am 59 and the extra length was perfect.","I ended up wearing flats, but could have definitely worn heels if I wanted.","Cons: Not great for smaller chested women - there was a lot of pinning that went into getting the chest to fit for all of the bridesmaids.","The zipper is basically impossible to zip up with such a heavy fabric - the dress needs a larger zipper to accommodate that.","The sequins fabric was REALLY itchy on the exposed skin (arms rubbed against it).","Also, keep in mind that the dress is really warm to wear - the sequin fabric does not allow for much airflow!","Overall, the dress was really pretty and ok to wear for short period of time.","The beautiful pictures and many compliments were worth it.","I wore a size 10L, but I wish I would have ordered the 8L.","The 10 was a little too big."
"6.0","this is a fabulous dress and I got comments on it all night!","the one downside is that as a small girl that back didnt stay, so there were some gaps.","id you are looking for great front photos tho, this dress will stand out from the crowd!"
"6.0","I think the dress is better suited for those with a bust.","Waist on down fit true to size.","Had I had a 2 it bit of fit a bit better."
"6.0","The fit was too big through out.","I am pretty true to size but the M was too big and the S fit great besides being way too short in the back.","I was bummed because its such a cute dress but I was not ok with my butt hanging out the back."
"6.0","This jacked is really, really oversized.","I wore it a bunch of times and am still keeping it for a while but when I catch a glimpse of myself wearing it, its 50:50 McHammer and cute.","I think its a style that photographs well and is really cool in concept, but in reality its just a LOT of fabric and that adds bulk.","Might be better for layering over sweaters..."
"6.0","Cute sweater.","Very heavy and cozy.","Im not a huge fan of the look on.","I have a very long torso and so this sweater was quite short for me.","Good quality, but definitely not worth the money (in my personal opinion)."
"6.0","this looked great on other people in the reviews, but i found it to be too short and with gapping cap sleeves.","its a lovely dress, but not right for me"
"6.0","The dress was adorable!","Ruffles were flattering and straps are adjustable.","Unfortunately, it ran pretty snug in the hips and would ride up when walking."
"6.0","The fit was probably ok but the dress I received was damaged so it was hard to tell.","I was unable to wear this to my event but the RTR group helped me to find an amazing replacement dress."
"6.0","Nice casual dress, great quality - the silk dress felt great to wear.","I knew it wasnt long, but was hoping it would be long enough for a no-big-meeting kind of day at the office - but nope, it was way to short to wear, at least for my work.","The style was just okay on me, not very figure flattering.","Nice to try a different style, but I dont anticipate renting this one again."
"6.0","This dress is absolutely gorgeous.","Another dress I rented was returned in a poor state, so RTR sent this to me as another option.","The dress was super comfy and the fit is really great, but the fabric was just a little too wild for me.","If the print appeals to you, it is a great dress."
"6.0","I rented this dress for professional headshots based on other reviews of women who rented for professional events.","It was overall a good choice - the fit was good (true size 6), the print was interesting, and it was very high-quality.","It wasnt really a showstopper, so I wouldnt rent for a social occasion, but it was good for my purposes."
"6.0","This pants were super comfy and fun to wear, but I have a big butt and the pattern is not that flattering.","I think this looks better on taller women.","Its a versatile piece.","You can wear it with sneakers and a tshirt or dress it up with heels and a blouse.","Great for the office."
"6.0","FIT : I wish it fit a bit tighter all around but the top half was definitely designed for the top heavy.","Unless you got a super bra; I wouldnt recommend this.","PRO : I really like the design of the dress; color and the lace detail."
"6.0","Was so excited when I got these because it is really cute, however it was extremely.","It covered as much as my swim suit bottoms thats how short it was.","But if you are short, I say go for it!"
"6.0","This was a beautiful dress.","It wasnt my first choice but was recommended by a very helpful associate and overnighted to me due to my original order being delayed by a storm.","Im not sure how it would have looked once I got it on but I couldnt get it past my shoulders.","Thankfully I had another dress to wear for the event."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this romper only because it looked very different than it does in pictures.","The colors were much more muted and wasnt as vibrant as I was hoping it would be."
"6.0","The photograph is so deceiving and is not oversized at all.","I ordered this in a small but the tag actually says XS/S.","The arms and shoulders run VERY small.","Had to send back but will likely request in a larger size.","The one I received also had black stains back the back center seam."
"6.0","I had gotten this for work but it was too dressy.","Also fit me awkwardly - I think you need a very long torso for it to fit right.","Its also very snug through the stomach area."
"6.0","Its a cute dress.","I wore the XS and it was still too big.","The fit is a little off, but I loved the colors."
"6.0","The color is very pretty.","As for the fit, once I zipped myself up, I felt like I had little room to breathe.","Definitely rent a size (or two) up.","I am normally a 0-2, so I rented a 2.","I wish I ordered a 4 or a 6.","Overall though, it is a pretty dress."
"6.0","nice fabric, arm holes are huge.","I woe it once.","I wont order this one again."
"6.0","I rented this for my bridal shower but was unable to wear it because its a bit too revealing for a C cup and up.","It really was a bummer because it is a beautiful dress!","Highly recommend if youve got a smaller chest."
"6.0","The six was a bit big and overall, not too flattering for me."
"6.0","it fit fine"
"6.0","This dress was beautiful but I found it was a bit too glitzy for a black tie wedding (for me).","I ended up going with the other option."
"6.0","This dress had amazing fabric and the details on the sleevea looked an ddelt really well made.","However this dress fitting my top and waist perfectly but was so tight around my legs there was no option of movement.","The dress looked great standing still but there was no way I could walk, sit, bend over or dance in it."
"6.0","Took a gamble on a dress that had zero reviews... and lost!","The dress itself is beautiful!","Just be aware that it does run pretty large.","I ordered a medium (I generally wear a 4 or 6) and probably should have gotten a small... maybe extra small if available!"
"6.0","It was a pretty dress, yet I didnt think it had a wow factor as much as in the photo of the RTR website.","I wore it and it was good.","This was not a dress that I would be excited to rent again, but I would wear it again.","I usually wear a 0, but couldve worn a 00.","It was a bit big on the bust because I dont have much and the stomach area was big and made me look like I had a belly which I dont have."
"6.0","I wore this with a black moto jacket and loved the overall look.","The dress speaks for itself so you dont have to do too much with your hair or accessories which is nice :) I didnt expect it to fit perfectly so its okay that it didnt.","The fabric was very light and comfortable.","I do feel like it wasnt the most flattering.","I am very curvy and I feel like it made me look bigger on top.","I loved the print and overall was happy with my first RTR experience!"
"6.0","The dress was nice.","Fabric was cotton and what I expected.","It just didnt look good on me.","You need to have a straight body to look good in this.","The dress being all black made it look so dark as well.","I returned right away and didnt wear it.","Customer service was great about the return."
"6.0","Ended up wearing the 4 as it fit better in most spots than the 6."
"6.0","Did not wear dress.","Dress was nice but too short from behind.","Wear white or nude boy-shorts underneath dress."
"6.0","I bought it as a backup style.","It was too tight to zip up and even if I was able to zip it up, it wouldve been tight elsewhere too and uncomfortable.","Order a size up.","53 & 36B"
"6.0","The straps were a little long and it required dress tape for the bust area - but it fit well and was comfortable"
"6.0","Universally flattering - if youre nervous about your dress, this is an excellent first choice or back-up.","Thats why I got it - it looked good in almost every single real person photo on here, no matter the shape/size.","Its stretchy (easy to move in), highlights/creates curves, and hides any flaws.","I ultimately wore a different dress (I tend to love minimalist looks - more my style) but would recommend this as an easy choice for anyone."
"8.0","I wanted to wear this out for dinner on a weekend, but it was just too see through and thin (the weather ended up being colder than i expected).","The cut also looked a little funny and made me look bulky on top.","But the fabric was really pretty!"
"8.0","So, my first choice (which I plan to rent another time) was not available and the AWESOME customer service rep Ariell helped me with reserving this one, plus helped me pick the perfect earrings (petite peacock pearl).","I wore an heirloom pearl necklace from my mother, but that was for nostalgia and didnt really fit the dress.","The stays in the bodice kept the dress up for 3 hours of dancing :) and made me sit up straight!","Ha!","The dress does run a bit on the smallish side.","I am an 8 normally, but with the rehearsal dinner the night before and a special lunch earlier in the day, I was not at my leanest...","So the 10L it was!","Also, I am 57 and had 3 heels and the dress dragged on the floor.","I stepped on it a lot and got stepped on by others near me, so if you go with the long, make sure you have the heels and/or the height for it.","That said, I would totally rent this one again.","I loved how it looked!!","PS The back up dress they sent was a beautiful option for another occasion.","I didnt realize they were going to send it, so I felt INUNDATED with choices and completely taken care of.","FAN FOR LIFE, RTR!"
"8.0","This was a fun sweater.","Do be aware that you may want to wear a cami under it - while the brown squares are solid (not knit), the blue is anything but solid knit; you definitely want to wear something under it, particularly if youre going to wear it to work.","Regarding fit, the torso was perfect in width and length.","The biceps were pretty tight and the arms were really long (I joke I have monkey arms, so if youre more petite, they may be too long for you).","I did like this sweater, but Im not sure who it was made for size-wise."
"8.0","Light, comfy.","The top seems wider when worn.","Wore to work and out shopping.","Everyday chic"
"8.0","I found the dress mostly true to size.","For a size 12, which I felt more comfortable in, the bust area was a bit tight.","I found a strapless minimizer bra that fit well and did not leave me tugging and pulling.","For the chestier ladies I wouldhighly recommend it with this dress.","I did get compliments and felt the sparkle for a  Saturday night formal wedding."
"8.0","Statement coat that hits the fur trend head on.","Noticeable but not outrageous.","Outside of my comfort zone but I loved it--the faux fur is very nice quality and soft, and the print is well done.","Only cons are that the closures are weak and pop open when you walk even though the coat is not tight and it runs a bit big--I wear a 10 and this fit easily over large sweaters with room to spare.","Works well with skinny jeans or black leggings and tall black boots."
"8.0","I used this dress for my baby shower.","I wanted a size 8 but it wasnt available and it probably would have made it 5 stars for me.","The sheath was a little shorter than I expected but I made it work.","The dress wouldnt zip but i wore it unzipped and everyone thought the the dress was supposed to do be open until I said something.","Overall great rental and I felt glamorous."
"8.0","The dress was beautiful and stunning.","I had a baby a few months ago and still look like I was 6 months pregnant.","The dress ran a little small in  belly area.","Overall it was great fit.","It gave a new meaning to the LBD.","I ordered a large but went with the xl due to the belly area."
"8.0","Would definitely rent this dress again!","There was a small hole in the lace that had been patched up that was a bit noticeable, but it fit great and got lots of compliments!"
"8.0","Loved this dress, and received a lot of compliments because it stands out beautifully.","I had a hard time though with the fit!","I have wider hips so my typical size 2 was a bit snug in the hips (borderline uncomfortable and too tight) but it fit well elsewhere.","I had also ordered one size up, but when I tried on the 4, it did not give me a lot of extra room in the hips (fit a little better in the hips, but still tight) and was significantly longer and too big on top and in the waist.","I wore spank with the 2 and made it through the night in the dress and was able to dance, but not a dress Id rent again or suggest to someone with wider hips."
"8.0","I wanted to be wowed by this dress, but wasnt.","Dont get me wrong it was definitely unique and beautiful, but it was not one of those dresses you put on and feel like a million dollars.","I ordered a small and medium as a backup.","The medium was very stretched out, it was obvious that it had been worn a lot.","The small was not as stretched out, but had visible signs of wear, it fit well, but rode up.","I received several compliments on the dress, so overall it was not a total loss, but I would have felt better in a dress that I didnt have to tug down all night."
"8.0","Loved the color, the fit and it perfectly hides any imperfections you may have.","Ordered a size 10 but ended up wearing the back up 12 because it had to stretch in the breast area.","I wouldve given it 5 stars if i didnt have to run out the house half dresses until i was able to find a neighbor outside who was kind enough to zip up the back for me.","I wish designers would take back zippers into consideration when someone has to get dress alone.","Would rent it again and again."
"8.0","I am usually a size 4 or 6 and ended up wearing the 8.","I am 53 1/2  and i felt the dress was a little short in the front so I had to wear smaller heels.","I wish I would have gotten the longer version.","Nevertheless it was stunning."
"8.0","I rented this dress for a holiday opera.","I received compliments about the shape and color.","The fabric is stable in structure.","I am normally a 2 but I ordered a 4 and am glad that I did.","Slightly tight in the hips and thighs."
"8.0","Dress is a great color but nothing overly special about it.","Comfortable work dress."
"8.0","The fit across the chest was forgiving and felt great.","The dress was a little tight but that is the way it is supposed to be.","Loved the details of the lace in the sleeves!"
"8.0","I got sizes 4&6 and wore the 6.","The color is gorgeous-unique and rich.","Exposed zipper in the back is a trend I dont love.","Otherwise, super cute!"
"8.0","Looked great.","May be a littly baggy for someone who does not have hips"
"8.0","This dress fits great.","I normally wear a medium, but only the large was available.","It hung well and wasnt too big on me.","It was easy to dance in.","The color is very much as pictured -- a pale pink/rose."
"8.0","The 8L fit like a glove.","There is a built-in bra so you do not have to worry about straps showing.","I needed the 8L with flats (usually Regular sizes work when I wear flats but this ran short).","The only con is that it was a little tight for dancing but overall was a great dress."
"8.0","If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would.","Overall, I adored it.","The sequins were itchy under my arms, but had I worn a cardigan it wouldnt have been a problem.","It was shorter in the back than I would have preferred (but Im so tall this is almost always a problem when I wear cocktail dresses).","Other than that, I felt like a million bucks in it and it really accentuated my bust.","This is not the dress to wear if youre trying to minimize your assets."
"8.0","The dress quality and fabric was amazing!","I have an athletic build and it ran a bit big on the size 8.","Length was great.","I cant wait for my next rental and event!"
"8.0","I love this Kate Spade dress.......Kate Spade dresses typically run tight in the chest area for me, though.","The bow is cute, definitely work appropriate, but I felt like the dress has seen better days."
"8.0","So, Im a little on the short side, but also at a higher weight than Im comfortable at.","The neckline is super gorgeous, but at this weight, with the length of the dress, I was not happy with the way my legs looked.","That being said, once I drop some pounds, I will rent it again, because it was beautiful.","If you like your legs, rent it...you will NOT be disappointed!"
"8.0","Small fit better in my chest but was too tight on my hips.","Medium fit perfect with a little gaping at my outer bust/armpit area.","Got many compliments, color was great!"
"8.0","The dress is beautiful!","I am only 53 and I found it was a little too long for my liking--but the cut was great!","My bust is 34D and the dress is thick enough to not have to wear a bra.","I wished that I would have ordered a size down (4) even though I normally wear a 8 or 10."
"8.0","I love this dress i ordered it in black for a wedding back in the summer loved it so much rented it for a previous wedding.","The dress runs big i am usually a 2-4 depending on designer and i wore a 0 in this, very flattering to body if you have bigger bust you may be spilling out the top.. but if you got it flaunt it!","i am a 34 D and was able to squeeze in it.","def.","would recommend."
"8.0","Such a classy dress.","Great first experience with RTR!"
"8.0","I really love this dress, perfect if youre having a bad body day.","It was really comfortable and the fabric is really nice.","It definitely runs big and is obviously suppose to be a sheath but I will reserve a Small next time."
"8.0","The dress is a bright red, not subdued by any means - more fire engine and less candy apple.","It also runs small - I sized up two sizes, which I have found necessary with this brand.","The fabric is thick but has some give to it, although the dress isnt very forgiving.","It hugs your curves and looks good doing it.","The slit is a perfect addition to a more conservative top, but it makes it so the red is classy, and not trashy.","I would consider renting again."
"8.0","I rented this to wear out in Miami--and it worked beautifully!","I wore this sparkler with a strapless bra and felt super comfortable (and still chic) all night.","The only downfall about this dress was the itchiness of the sequins under your arms.","This dress wont make you feel teeny tiny because of the blousiness of the dress, but it is still perfect for a night out!"
"8.0","I wore other Herve dressed in Medium and they fit fine.","NOT this one.","It certainly runs very very fitted with not much wiggle room like the others.","Not for a curvy girl."
"8.0","Like all Free People this coat runs on the larger side.","I am normally a Medium in most tops but ordered the small.","I could not zip the jacket up but it fit perfect everywhere else.","I left it open and it still looked good.","I got so many compliments on the jacket.","Well made and great quality."
"8.0","This was a great decision and dress to wear.","I wanted  to be the dressiest person at our dinner and I was for sure.","It was tighter and shorter than I would have normally chosen but Im glad I went with it."
"8.0","I would absolutely rent this dress again.","It was a little short when sitting but it was perfect while standing up!","I received tons of compliments throughout the night.","Its so feminine and the lace was beautiful or a summer night."
"8.0","I order a size up in this dress and Im glad I did.","The waist was a little loose on me, but I have wide shoulders so I needed the 4.","The color is not overwhelming.","The bow details are so sweet.","I got so many compliments I ended up wearing this twice during my rental period (and almost considered buying!).","Did not disappoint."
"8.0","I ordered this in my first Unlimited package and was overall pretty happy.","I didnt notice the slit in the back when I ordered this, but ended up really liking it.","The jacket wasnt very flattering on me - the padding in the shoulders landed weirdly, and while I liked the slit, I think a more fitted jacket looks better on me."
"8.0","As an athlete with a wider back, it was tough to get the dress to zip because of the location of the fabric change.","But once it was on the dress fit like a glove and was actually very comfortable.","Fabric isnt too heavy and very silky soft.","This is my one chance a year to get fancy, and the dress definitely helped make the night a great one.","I felt like Madam President."
"8.0","great fall dress - work this to work and got tons of compliments.","really pretty colors."
"8.0","I loved this dress - I had actually rented a Slate & Willow dress for another occasion.","It was a great fit and looked incredible in person.","Very happy with this rental!"
"8.0","This is a very nice maxi dress, the length was ok on me in heels.","I loved the floral / stripes mix up here.","Fabric was very comfortable.","I will say that its not forgiving at all, meaning it does not conceal problem areas."
"8.0","Such a great dress!","I wore it for my birthday night out at a casino.","Was perfect for dinner and even better for the club we went to afterwards.","It looked great with a statement necklace and over the knee boots.","I ordered the small and medium as a backup.","I lift weights so my arms and shoulders run a bit bigger so I had to wear the medium.","The material is on the heavy side which I didnt mind because I felt secure and held in all night.","The dress is VERY short so I felt myself pulling it down quite often.","Overall I would definitely recommend!"
"8.0","I love the color of this dress, so obviously had to rent it!","unfortunately its not flattering on my body type.","im petite, but am large chested.","the bagginess of the slouch fit did not complement me well.","but its a beautiful dress and on the right body type would be extremely flattering!"
"8.0","Love this dress.","The color is gorgeous and fit very flattering.","It was amazing to dance in.","If you have a fuller bust, I would recommend ordering your true size.","I could have used a little more coverage on top, but it was still lovely."
"8.0","I wore this to the Operation Smile Gala in Los Angeles.","I was told that the 0R wouldnt be bad for someone thats 52 with heels.","I wore 3+ inch heels and it was LOONGG, so if youre short DEFINITELY go for the petite.","Despite the length issue, this dress got me a lot of attention and stood out in a sea of black dresses and dark suits.","LOVE the high neckline - I didnt feel choked at all like some women have complained about.","The clasp in the back stayed put.","All in all it was a GREAT dress with the only qualm being the length.","I was photographed a lot in it so I wont be renting this particular dress again, but another wonderful rental from RTR."
"8.0","none"
"8.0","Liked the dress, but very hard to walk/dance in.","Doesnt have a slit in the front or back which made it more tricky.","Loved the color and athletic look the dress had though."
"8.0","Dress was very comfortable, and the neckline was sexy but still appropriate for a work holiday party.","My only complaint is that it was a little big in the waist, so that it wasnt the most flattering.","But I still felt good in it.","I would size down."
"8.0","I got a lot of compliments from people in the wedding who said the dress was very unique!","The sequins make the dress feel very special.","Theres no need for extra jewelry because the dress does all of the work!","The shape was a nice fit as well too.","I did not feel constricted in it and felt comfortable all night."
"8.0","I rented this dress for NYE and ended up needed to work at my part-time job.","It fit like a glove!","Due to the amount of cleavage this dress showed, I had to wear a black cami underneath in order to wear it for work, but I got compliments throughout the evening from all of the guests on how great the dress looked!","A huge hit!"
"8.0","The sleeves on this dress are no joke!","Size up if you have not-skinny arms.","The 8 fit the rest of my body well, but could not get it past my elbows!","The 10 fit well - a little loose all over, but the arms were still tight.","No stretch here, so be cautious."
"8.0","I loved this dress on the site, but not so much on me."
"8.0","This top is more casual than it may appear (eyelet cotton on top), which makes it versatile - I wore it to brunch with shorts and to work with dress pants.","Im 59, 34DD, and the shirt was shorter on me than on the model, but it was still plenty long.","My only complaint is the bottom part of the eyelet layer.","I wish it had tapered in a bit.","It was form fitting over the chest, but the stiff white fabric combined with the somewhat shapeless eyelet caused it to jut out awkwardly at the bottom of the eyelet.","But otherwise, it was very cute!"
"8.0","I rented this dress for an outdoor family wedding in CA last summer and the cut-out in the back quickly became the only reason I didnt completely melt.","The fabric was thicker and stiffer than I had expected and although the size 4 I also got fit better overall, the neckline felt too tight.","I ended up wearing the size 6, which was very comfortable and got me lots of compliments, but I did worry about the back (and that perfect cut-out) being a bit looser that I would have liked.","In addition to the cut-out, this dress also has POCKETS = the best.","Id definitely rent this dress again."
"8.0","Dress was too big in the waist and less sheer than the stock photo.","Very elegant choice, just not right for my event.","I ended up wearing a different dress."
"8.0","The fit overall was great, the  bust area was a little large but with my strapless bra it help the fit.","Love the length Im 59and 168 the peplum really made the waist appear smaller.","I would definitely use RTR again.","I would have given five out five, but the bust area ran large.","If you are taller than 59 you should opt for an extra long length."
"8.0","The overall fit was pretty true to size.","They didnt have my exact size (4L) so I rented a 2L and a 6L.","The 2 was tight but fit, but was way too short for me at 59 (even with no shoes on).","The 6L was a tad big, so I put a skinny belt at my waist and it worked well.","The length of the 6 was perfect for me with 2 1/2 heels.","The only downside was that my bust didnt fill out the top of the dress very well.","Possibly better for a more busty woman!"
"8.0","Fit great and very comfortable.","Sleeves are slightly tight, but loved this dress!!!","!"
"8.0","I normally shy away from strapless/one-shoulder dresses, but once I put this dress on, I couldnt say no.","It runs quite large (even the 8R was a bit large on me in places), but overall, the fit was great.","I received so many compliments throughout the night and the fabric was perfect for a chilly fall evening.","Im 52 and wore 3.5 inch heels, though wish I had gone with 4+ inches, as I had to keep picking up the dress so I wouldnt trip."
"8.0","The waist fit of the dress was perfect, but the chest runs super large.","I actually had to safety pin the dress so that it fit in the chest."
"8.0","This was sent as a replacement - it fit, but was a tad small, I wish I had the 16R.","But, for a rental, one day wear, it was fine.","The somewhat flow skirt fit my hips just fine, the top was a bit tight.","Lots of people loved the dress, and it was fun to wear!","I would rent it again, depending on the event.","Would be a great dress for a simple wedding, anniversary, vow renewal, etc."
"8.0","This fit pretty true to size.","At a blue and silver wedding this was a refreshing change of pace."
"8.0","The fit was good.","The zipper was very hard to get over the seam in the back.","Overall it was comfortable to wear.","The fabric was not shiny like what I saw in the photo and the detailing on the nude area around the collarbone was actually gold flowers.","Which was odd since the image showed silver shoes and I had planned for everything to be silver.","Overall it was a great dress, very comfortable and I received a bunch of compliments."
"8.0","Was not a fan of the fabric."
"8.0","This coat is really nice!","Great style.","Clean and sophisticated lines.","Flattering lightweight warmth!","Received lots of compliments.","My only complaint is that the color is much more faded in person.","Instead of being a nice emerald green, the color was like a faded muted emerald.","Still nice just surprised.","Would recommend!"
"8.0","This was flattering for a party with work colleagues.","Very nice, cute, slightly sexy, but nothing overt.","The hemline is super cute.","Good safe choice."
"8.0","I rented both size 6 & 8 but ultimately wore the 6 because the straps were too long on the 8 & I thought they would fall down all nite.","Now that I look at the photos, the 8 would have looked better as the 6 was too short on the bottom & too tight in the bust.","Overall, loved the dress & I got lots of compliments."
"8.0","Fit well and is flattering.","Looked great with a short jacket and is long enough for tall ladies!"
"8.0","The length was perfect, not too long but still short enough to be conservatively sexy.","My only problem was the top was a little too narrow for my shoulders (Im athletically built), but the middle was too baggy and a little wide.","I ordered a M and a L, but wore the medium.","I just would have liked it to be more fitting around the middle.","Also, the middle is ruched which you cant really see in the pic"
"8.0","I did not end up wearing this dress because it was awkwardly tight on my chest but loose above that and left a weird gap in that area.","It is a beautiful dress but would be better on a smaller chested women."
"8.0","Was my back up so didnt wear.","I would rent again"
"8.0","It was a little smaller than expected but still comfortable to wear and really I couldnt believe that compliments.","Felt great wearing it."
"8.0","The shirt was absolutely beautiful.","Excellent quality.","It it a bit thick so better for fall and winter events.","I received so many compliments.","This shirt totally dresses up a pair of black pants.","You have to be careful of the sleeves when reaching or eating, as they are quite big and will get into something.","Love this shirt and would totally rent again.","The shirt does run a little big, so if you want it to fit to the contours of your body, go a size down."
"8.0","Runs a bit big on the bust, as a 34D size 6/8 the medium still gaped a little on me at the front of the armholes."
"8.0","Wore this to a wedding for a cousin-in-law and so many of my family members complimented me on the dress and asked me where Id gotten it!","The skirt was a little long  even though im 5/8 and it was a little heavy but overall nice."
"8.0","I was very excited to rent this dress but nervous because I did read a lot of reviews about the neck being tight, but a lot of people still raved about the dress.","I ended up wearing the small, as the medium was too big around my chest and stuck out on the sides.","However, the small was very tight around my neck.","I got used to it at first but as the night went on the tiny strap that are tight around neck started irritating my skin.","But sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad, because other than that I looooved the way the dressed looked and I got so many compliments all night.","So overall, Im happy with my rental and it was worth a little pain :)"
"8.0","I always get a 4 and 6.","I was swimming in the 6.","The 4 fit but was a little baggy through the hips which is weird because I have curves.","The material has stretch to it."
"8.0","This dress is beautiful in person.","However, its pretty unflattering even for a swing dress.","The arm holes are also small relative to the size I ordered."
"8.0","This dress was the perfect pick!","I was nervous to be showing so much skin, but it really was the perfect balance of conservative and sexy.","I ordered a size 2 and 4, unsure of the fit, and the 2 fit like a glove.","if you are small up top, like me, a bra is not necessary.","Since the dress fit just right, I also decided to forego using fashion tape in the back.","This dress itself is an attention grabber, so I would recommend keeping the accessories simple.","If you rent this dress, you will not be disappointed :)"
"8.0","Had to return this to get a size smaller (havent tried it smaller yet).","It fit very large.","The pant legs were also longer and wider than I anticipated.","Maybe the small will be better."
"8.0","This dress was very nice.","It did hug a little to closely to my stomach, even with Spanx I felt it drew attention to my mid-section too much for my liking.","The length was perfect.","I would have worn this but I went with the Slate & Willow tuxedo wrap gown instead."
"8.0","The dress runs true to size.","I went with a size up to have a loose versus fitted feel around the midsection.","Some of the sequins lost shape but that is typical of the style.","The lace at the bottom and top gives it a sexy but classy look.","Paired with Kate Spade glitter earrings.","#goldenbirthday"
"8.0","Very nice dress, was very comfortable.","Only con was it was a little itchy.","Not sure if its the beading or the cleaner, but it wasnt that bad!"
"8.0","I usually wear a 6 and the 6L was a good length, but too loose in the waist.","The look of the dress is to be shorter in the front then in the back.","Be aware because I didnt realize that until I got it.","I wasnt crazy about my shoes showing in the front and having a small train in the back."
"8.0","I have fairly large boobs and the top was way too big.","I tightened the straps so ended up being fine, but not very flatter on top.","Cant wear a bar so I wore sticky boobs but it was so hot and humid they kept falling off.","The fabric gathered slightly over the boobs so ended up being fine without a bra.","Long, so wore with wedges.","Pockets were awesome, but one pocket was sewn different than the other so I couldnt still both of my hands in — kind of bothered me, but I got over it.","I would rent again though."
"8.0","Runs very short.","I liked the fit for the 6 but definitely needed the length of the 8."
"8.0","The dress is extremely flattering at the waist, a beautiful rich color, and nice and light.","I could not wear it, however, because it did not fit properly in the bust.","Highly recommended for a smaller bust.","Length perfect for work."
"8.0","So I am six feet tall, and I knew, from looking at the pictures, that there was a good chance this would not be a dress on me.","I sized up to a L, just in case...and unfortunately, I was right.","This was barely a tunic, so I wore it with leggings, and one night with jeans.","And because I sized up to a L, it was a bit huge, and had tons of fabric that just enveloped me.","That being said, I still loved the top because its fun, and very on trend, and did wear it out.","But if you are even the slightest bit tall, just be aware that it will barely cover your butt, and plan your outfit accordingly.","It also, for whatever reason, picked up every spare bit of lint and cat hair in my apartment, and I almost walked out looking like a human lint roller.","I have a cat, and usually can easily get hair off of my clothes and dont feel like a walking advertisement for crazy cat ladies, but in this case random stray cat hairs just jumped at the chance to clint to the fabric, as did every random bit of lint in my apartment.","Be warned, and give yourself plenty of time to de-lint yourself before you walk out the door!"
"8.0","Great rental I would def recommend this dress, everyone complimented me on the rich pink color, and the style was great.","Im def renting again,also rented the turquoise earring with gold necklace."
"8.0","I ordered this as my back up dress but ended up wearing it to my formal event.","Its absolutely gorgeous!","Definitely a curve-hugger.","I wish the dress was longer - which is why Im only giving this dress 4 stars.","Im 59 and had to wear low heels (or no heels) for the dress to touch the ground.","The dress was snug on me, but I dont think I would have had the same look if I went up a size.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"8.0","OVERALL: This dress is fairly beautiful and safe.","This is one of those dresses that wont stand out in a crowd but wont make you out of place, overdress or underdress either.","It has just the right amount of style.","Youre right on the formal dress code.","In other words, this dress is beautiful but has no wow factor which was perfect when I wore it on a wedding.","It an ocassion where I dont need a dress to overshadow the bride but enough to shine among the guests, so this worked out perfectly!","FIT: I marked this dress True to Size but let me explain more.","I am a regular size 6 (115, 5ft) but this dress can show a little bit of bulge at the waist but not bad.","Be also prepared that this dress will show some cleavage.","I wore 8R at the night of the wedding.","I would guess that size 6 is best for 34-28-34 (Give or take 1-2 inches).","Size 8 if you are 36-30/32+-36 (Give or take 1 to 2 inches).","LENGTH: Im 5 tall and wore a 6-inch platform Still, theres about 4-5 inch extra to tape or hide.","My solution is that I own a very gorgeous obi gold belt that I could use on this dress to fix the hem.","If you have something similar, you can use that as a solution.","Taping wont work well with this dress because the material is heavy.","It wont keep.","For sure the tape will get lose while walking alone.","So dont rely on tape alone.","WOULD I RECOMMEND IT: Yes.","Despite all my honest comments.","However, this dress stood out more when I paired it with gorgeous princess champagne necklace and dangling earrings set.","I think thats what pulled the outcome of the dress much better.","Thats what I like about this dress.","Its easy to pair with accessories.","CUSTOMER SERVICE: This dress wasnt my first choice but RTR helped me all the way to get a dress rented.","Just for customer service alone, I would definitely rent, use and recommend their service again!"
"8.0","great fit, great length, i work scrappy nude/greyish heeled sandals with it and one bracelet.","the dress does not need accessories.","received tons of compliments all night, great color and fit!","!"
"8.0","Pros: Perfect for Christmas Party or NYE.","Cons: Sequins snag on hair, furniture, etc."
"8.0","The dress is gorgeous in person and the color will definitely make you stand out in a good way at a wedding or any formal function.","I received many compliments on the dress and color.","I would definitely rent Elizabeth and James again.","Their dresses fit very well and hug your body without it being too tight.","The only con is that since Im petite the dress did bunch up a bit in the middle region.","No one really noticed but other than that loved my rental!"
"8.0","This dress was so easy to wear!","It flows while you walk or dance and the colors were just as vibrant in person as in the picture!"
"8.0","Loved this dress!","The zipper was a tad tricky but otherwise it was comfortable and fit like a glove."
"8.0","I got a lot of complements on the dress - I had to wear a small (medium looked crazy big on me), which I think resulted in the dress being inappropriately short.","May be better for someone shorter, overall though it worked for my friends bridal shower."
"8.0","Super flattering fit, but a bit scrunched up at the waist (Ive got a bit of a belly pouch).","The bra straps showed a little, so I ended up wearing a racerback bra and fixed that.","The pockets are amazing, and the material is so wonderful - I sat outside in the 80 degree heat during the wedding ceremony, and didnt sweat at all."
"8.0","I originally ordered the size 4L and 6L in the same dress but the color green.","I am a size 4.","The 4 looked very big on me.","I called and they were able to overnight to me the same dress in this color in a size 2L.","The dress fit beautifully.","This was my first time using rent the runway.","I was very happy with the customer service.","I am also happy i opted to have the dress delivered two days early just in case I had any issues.","The reviews for the green dress said it ran small and the stylist suggestions said to order the backup one size bigger which is why I got the size 6 for backup.","Go with your instinct.","I had a feeling it would be big.","Also glad i went with the long.","The suggestion for my height was to order a regular.","That would have been too short to wear with heels.","Overall happy with the result."
"8.0","Was a little loose in the butt/waist area.","Ended up wearing the other dress but this would have also been great!","Loved the sexy shoulders.","Its true you really can go braless with this because of the ruffle that falls over the chest.","And I never do that!"
"8.0","The fit was great and this dress was perfect for a spring evening affair!","It was very flattering and very comfortable.","I spent the entire evening running around the event and did not fuss with my dress once!"
"8.0","I wore this dress as I was an honorary bridesmaid in a wedding.","It was a formal wedding so I wanted to wear a long dress.","I am 56 and was concerned the regular might be too short once I wore heels, but after reading reviews I decided to go with the regular.","Thank goodness I did.. this dress was VERY long!","I ended up tying the bottom of the dress in a knot so I could dance at the reception.","The neckline is very flattering and the dress is comfortable for being a long, chiffon dress.","I vary in sizes depending on the brand, so I ordered my size and the size up in case the strapless did not fit my bust.","The smaller size (10) ended up fitting a little big, so I recommend getting your size and the size under so you are not pulling it up all night..","Overall, gorgeous dress but if I could do it again I would size down a size and get the regular.","enjoy!"
"8.0","I got the 2 & a backup 4 - thank goodness I did.","The 2 wouldnt go past my upper thighs.","The 4 was also tight when I first put it on, but after wearing it for a while it got a bit roomier - there isnt much stretch though.","Many complained that the back strap seemed loose, but I thought it was perfect, it fit correctly and made the dress a little less hello!","in the back for a wedding."
"8.0","too large in waist/body, but cut small under arms"
"8.0","Wore this dress in the evening while on vacation in Punta Cana.","The fit was great.","I have a larger chest and am always hesitant with thin straps but this gave enough coverage.","I wore it with a NuBra to give it a little bit of support.","Overall it was great in the hot weather and very cute."
"8.0","Dress was true to size but the Long was a little long for someone who is 57.","That can be fixed with tall shoes!"
"8.0","It is a challenge for a larger bust with having no back.","I am a 34DD and had to use fashion tape and then it kept pulling on the tape so i was constantly fixing it when sitting.","Standing was not as much of a problem.","I think it has stretched over time.","The back is so beautiful and it is a great length when so many other dresses are so short and inappropriate.","The lace had to be ironed to lay correct in a bunch of places.","Overall i am still so pleased with how i looked and felt."
"8.0","Got this with my Unlimited Subscription.","The fabric was thin which I liked in this June heat.","I loved the extra fabric on the side; it gave the dress some interest.","I wore to work with black heels and received quite a few compliments."
"8.0","This is an easygoing summer dress with a cool silhouette and a comfortable fit"
"8.0","I was looking for something classy, sophisticated, and able to adapt to the unpredictable weather of early May in NYC.","This dress fit the bill perfectly.","The dress was a little loose in the side/tummy area, but other than that, it fit really well.","It is backless, but I went without a bra and was fine as the material is pretty thick.","This was a very high energy wedding with a lot of moving and dancing, and I didnt feel uncomfortable at all.","The ONLY issue I had was a small hole in the back of the dress.","In retrospect, I should have tried the dress on earlier and noticed it, but I was able to conceal the minor hole without a problem.","I would DEFINITELY rent this dress again."
"8.0","Was great except in the ribcage and underbust area (was very tight, I had to size up and was still squeezed in).","This was not designed with plus size women in mind, would recommend sizing up even 2 higher than normal to have a more comfortable fit."
"8.0","This dress is very cute in person and I got several compliments.","I didnt love the material, it felt a little cheap.","It wasnt an unflattering dress, but it also didnt do anything to make me look thinner.","Its pretty low cut so I wore with a bandeau.","Id rent again.","Its cute for daytime summer wear."
"8.0","Flattering, classy sparkly dress.","If anything, runs a little bit big.","Although its low-cut, it didnt show too much cleavage - perfect for a fancy work event.","Was a little bit long on me (Im 54) compared to the model.","Rouching material at the waist makes it very flattering.","Ive rented quite a few RTR dresses now, and although this wasnt my favorite, it was a very pretty dress."
"8.0","This dress is very fitted, but it is stretchy and the asymmetric hem is flattering and makes me less conscious that it is hugging my body to closely!","The shorter length in the skirt is a bit short for an office!"
"8.0","Not form fitting but that was what I liked about it.","Runs true to size."
"8.0","The maroon/burgundy color was great for a fall wedding.","The dress was comfortable to dance in all night.","I went with the S over the XS strangely because of the neck.","I felt like I was suffocating in the XS.","The length of the skirt hit me further down my shin than on the model, but it still looked nice."
"8.0","This dress is a beautiful magenta color!","I received so many compliments.","It does run a little small, so I suggest sizing up, especially if you a curvy shape (like myself).","I usually wear a size 4, but I rented the size 6 and it worked great."
"8.0","Beautiful dress.","I wore it with a standard flesh colored bra.","You can see it in pictures but it wasnt really noticeable in person.","The fit was great, but it was just a tad short when you sit.","There is no stretch to the fabric.","I did not have to wear spanx thankfully.","The peplum detail looks really nice and is long enough to hide your stomach.","It was a great dress and I got lots of complements.","The dress is more wine colored than maroon."
"8.0","While the fit was true to size it was a little longer than I expected.","Very cute though!"
"8.0","The fit was great.","Pros: the color and details are absolutely gorgeous.","Cons: If youre under 51 and youre looking for a above knee dress I dont recommend this dress.","Its still an amazing dress!!","!"
"8.0","Pros: very cool neckline, great quality fabric (strong and flexible), easy to sit down, good length, nice colorCons: less flattering on lower stomach (mine isnt very flat, and I didnt think it hid it well), a bit plain"
"8.0","I loved this dress.","Its very comfortable and I think it looks expensive.","It RUNS SHORT!","But Im 59, so this could just be the case for taller women.","(I was pushing it for work).","I wore with tan knee high leather boots.","The dress is a super dark navy like the picture, but I think appears to be more navy in person."
"8.0","This was a gorgeous dress!","It was very comfortable and easy to move in.","It runs a little large.","I usually wear an 8 and probably could have gone with a 6, but the 8 was fine.","I have a fairly short torso for my height, so the dress was very low cut on me.","All in all, great dress!"
"8.0","It was a little big and long for me (Im a petite 51).","So not as flat-erring as I would have liked.","I would definitely recommend for a taller girl.","Also, Im usually a 0 (and even then sometimes too big, as I have a smaller rib-cage/chest area), but they were out, so I got a size 2.","I think a size down would have helped a little.","Overall, it was still a cute dress though.","I liked the material (had a fishnet like pattern) that made the dress more fun and youthful."
"8.0","Dress is tight through the bust and mid section but very loose and comfy on the bottom.","The front slit is a little high when seated but the length overall is perfect.","I wore with a Gray/White rolled cuff blazer & gold jewelry -got tons of compliments at my work event."
"8.0","The dress fit nicely, the material was heavy in a good way.","It didnt feel cheap.","The silhouette was nice, it definitely hugged every curve and the waist area was accentuated by the crisscross and sheer details.","Its a simple but elegant style and Im glad I chose it!"
"8.0","Was a little concerned about the bust fitting - but the fit was perfect.","The dress was very comfortable and I could move easily.","The dress is meant to puddle on the ground, so practice walking while holding it - its very easy to trip on."
"8.0","Overall it fit pretty well, I wanted to wear the 2R, however, I could not get the zipper up and it was too short.","The 4 was the perfect length and fit worn with flat shoes and a strapless bra."
"8.0","It was poofier on the bottom than I was expecting but a very comfortable dress.","I dressed it down with flats for a casual wedding.","I loved the fabric of the skirt and it was different than my typical sheath dresses.","The top made me look very skinny with the tight red fabric and the black band around the waist.","I probably wouldnt rent again since its more of a one time dress, but for this occasion it was fantastic!"
"8.0","This dress has a lovely red color that is perfect for a wedding.","The neckline is so pretty and the cut is universally flattering.","My only complaint is that the skirt rode up a bit when I sat down.","I usually wear a 6 or an 8, and the size 6 fit better up top, so I chose it.","The skirt length was short, but fine when I was standing up, but when I sat down for the ceremony, it rose up a little bit higher than Id like.","Overall, though, a really beautiful dress."
"8.0","Great fit, beautiful color, very comfortable, careful if youre tall!","Very short."
"8.0","This fits nicely, but also be aware that it shows your curves (especially your booty).","The fabric is somewhat clingy, but nice.","Its also a little short.","Overall, I liked it.","But didnt feel incredibly comfortable wearing it."
"8.0","This dress was fun and comfortable for the beach wedding I attended, but it hugs the body in such a way that I felt most confident wearing spanx.","I wore the spanx that work kind of like a slip (open at the bottom not shorts) as the dress slit was too high for other styles.","I tucked the spanx straps into the top part of the dress, and everything worked fine.","I didnt even have to wear a bra, despite generally needing that support with other dresses.","I thought I would need the larger dress, but I wore my regular size, and it was fine.","The color was a little more of a mustard color than I thought."
"8.0","The drop waist made my hips look large so I was a little self conscious.","I got compliments on the dress though.","It was heavier so its definitely not a summer dress."
"8.0","Just like other reviews stated, the dress is short.","I ended up wearing leggings with it, which was perfect for a Christmas party."
"8.0","Loved the pattern of the fabric, loved the length, but as a few other people have mentioned the sleeves are snug, for me uncomfortably so."
"8.0","Im on the tall side so this ended up being more of a tunic than a dress on me, though thats not necessarily a bad thing.","Im broad and muscular so it was tight-ish in the arms, but still totally wearable.","I thought it was a cool comfy look for both work and a casual date night."
"8.0","got 2 of the same sizes, but thank god the 4 fit"
"8.0","It fit well, pretty true to size.","The only thing I was say about it is that you cant wear any under garments because it is very revealing of any material you might put under it.","It was great for dancing and I got compliments on it all  night!","The color was very vibrant and went well with my pale completion."
"8.0","I really loved how this dress looked.","I would only recommend renting if you have a steamer on hand.","The tulle on the skirt needed at least 20 minutes of steam to get out the wrinkles.","The finished product looked great."
"8.0","This is a very forgiving dress - the fabric has a lot of stretch.","The rouching on the side smoothed the look.","Neckline is a little low cut, but stayed in place over dinner.","Very sexy look."
"8.0","This is such a pretty shirt made of the perfect weight material.","Its cut definitely emphasizes curves without being (too) lascivious.","Because its been so cold in my town I ended up wearing this over a turtleneck bodycon dress with OTK boots and a wide belt which ruined the great natural drape a little.","I indicated that it ran large because it had a side zip, which I took to mean that it wasnt meant to be worn relaxed as I did.","Sizing down would flatter a true hourglass or add curves to a gamine figure.","I thought the length was long and the v-neck deep, but I could have just sized up accidentally.","Im 53, 125lb, 34D, 27 waist."
"8.0","Runs small.","Im usually a true 2R, but rented a 4R as backup due to all the reviews.","To be fair, the 2R zips, but it would have been a hassle getting in and out of the outfit all night.","I never understood how so many people wore jumpsuits/rompers out.","What happens when you have to pee?","Such a hassle.","In any case, this was my first jumpsuit ever.","I know.","Ill have to rent more since it went so well."
"8.0","Simply stunning dress, and I got many compliments.","Im petite, but the dress wasnt too long.","However, the front bodice was a bit big and the threads looked like they had stretched out from others with larger chests.","The front sagged a bit unless I pulled down on the waist to keep the bodice smooth.","I wasnt able to wear a padded bra underneath because the back is cut low.","Overall, though, I felt beautiful in the dress."
"8.0","love the classic look of this dress, with the sassy cutout in the middle.","it was perfect to wear to my boyfriends law school formal!"
"8.0","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and got lots of compliments.","I wasnt over the moon about it because the bottom flares out quite a bit and made me look a bit off-balanced; however its great for hiding bigger lower bodies.","The upper lace part of the dress was very pretty.","All in all perfect for a bridal shower but not something I would buy (enter RTR!).","Fairly long on me, and Im 58."
"8.0","At first I wasnt sure what Id pair this skirt with but it was giving me a Spanish vibe so I paired it with a black blouse with lace and leather details; it fit together great.","The skirt fit true-to-size for me and was very flattering in all the right places.","The fabric is thick and heavy so it didnt wrinkle or bunch in any places it shouldnt."
"8.0","Much less sparkly in real life, so perfect for a rehearsal dinner but was way too small for me :-( Id definitely size up at least one, if not two sizes."
"8.0","I ordered a size up from my normal size, which is a 14.","Im glad I did.","The size 14 wouldnt have fit.","I received the 16WR and 16WL.","The 16WR wouldnt zip all the way up and would have been tight if it had.","I tried on the 16WL but didnt zip it up because I thought it was too long.","So I took it off and began to worry about what I was going to do.","I needed a dress for the next day.","I was about to go crazy until my boyfriend came home and zipped me up.","The fit of the dress was perfect and my shoes added just enough height."
"8.0","This dress was really very pretty, but the front is a bit blasé.","From the back its a stunner!","I feel that a well endowed woman would look lovely in this dress, I however didnt fill it out.","True to size but at 56 3 inch heels would have been to much so get a long for heels!"
"8.0","I LOVE LOVE LOVED this dress!","Its super comfortable and has a fun skirt that twirls beautifully when you dance!","The fabric is thick but wasnt too heavy for me to wear at a mostly outdoor wedding in September.","Its blue and black pattern is subtle but also gives the dress some more elegance and the neckline is just incredibly flattering.","As others have said, I also had to pin back the straps because they were too long, but it was a quick fix.","Got compliments all night, and my date couldnt tell me enough how much he loved me in this dress.","Its a winner!","HIGHLY recommend."
"8.0","This dress was great for the wedding I attended.","It got a ton of compliments, and it has pockets!","It was slightly on the long side because Im short and size P wasnt available, but it worked ok with heels."
"8.0","I was the most glamorous that evening.","The size 14L was the more comfortable choice (easiest to zip up), but happened to be too loose in the bust region and at 56 wearing 5 heels, the long touched the floor.","All in all, I felt like a movie star all night."
"8.0","I m normally pretty anti-sequins, but I took a chance and wore this to the Inaugural Ball in January and loved it!","Its definitely one of the more popular RTR dresses, so be prepared to see a couple of other gals wearing the dress if youre going to a large event.","But it fits great and is super flattering!","Its also less gold than it looks in the photo--more of a peach/pink color and its absolutely gorgeous."
"8.0","Fit true to size.","The sequins did chafe my arms for about a minute but then I didnt even notice them!"
"8.0","I unfortunately ended up not wearing this dress because it ran a bit small.","Normally I wear a size 0 (occasionally the 2) and the 0 wouldnt zip up all the way for me to wear.","Its really an adorable dress so Im sure if I had a size larger it would have been perfect!"
"8.0","A little tight in the shoulders but overall comfortable.","If you plan to wear with lower cut jeans, prepare for a little tummy to show.","I paired with high waisted black skinnys and it looked great!"
"8.0","I wore this out with my girls to go drinking/dancing.","It was a little shorter than I would normally like, but was only really noticeable when I sat on a bar stool.","Since I was standing/ dancing most of the night it was perfect!"
"8.0","I waited too long to rent a dress for NYE and I was a little skeptical about this dress because some of the reviews say if youre pear shaped or have a booty, this isnt the dress for you.","I ordered the dress in a size 2 and 4 and the 2 was perfect for a sexy yet classy NYE look.","This dress totally hugs your curves in all the right places and I was getting compliments all night!","It was a little short, even on me but I was overall so happy with my first RTR experience!"
"8.0","Cut of shoulders was too revealing for work, so I paired the dress with a black bolero jacket.","Worth noting depending on the nature of your event.","Fabric at hem was falling a bit, but I was able to iron it back into shape.","Overall a very pretty dress."
"8.0","The dress actually is a few inches longer in the back so you can show off your shoes with your dress.","I was a little thrown off because it made me feel like the dress was too short, but otherwise, it fit perfectly!"
"8.0","The dress was very cute and Great Gatsby-esque.","I received a number of compliments about how cute the dress was.","It was very short and the cut or pattern on it made me look a little hippy, but it was still a really nice dress and looked good."
"8.0","I wore this to a charity event that my husband and I had to go to.","The dress is really pretty in person and is made very well.","I own a few Carmen Marc Valvo dresses and for some reason this one ran a bit large.","Maybe because it is a long dress or maybe it had something to do with the type of fabric.","Next time Ill rent two different sizes just to be safe."
"8.0","Great bright, vivid color.","It runs a bit large as I usually wear a 2 and the 0 was still big in the waist.","I added a belt to help define it, but some pictures I took from the side werent very flattering because of this."
"8.0","Dress for the most part runs true to size.","I have a large bust and waist so i felt like it was a bit snug there.","Additionally, the shoulders were actually a bit large.","It did not totally fit flush to my body, but it wasnt noticeable and was not really uncomfortable.","Id recommend this dress to anyone for a formal affair, wedding, etc.","Additionally, it works for more casual events like a cocktail party or even a dinner party.","So worth it!"
"8.0","This was my backup dress for a wedding I was apart of.","I was told to wear a coral dress and thank goodness I added this on to my order a few days before the event as my initial choice was too short.","This guy is tight, but beautiful.","Im curvy/athletic in my hips and booty.","Im 57, 145# and fluctuate between a 6 and an 8.","They both fit, but both bunched across my hip area in the front, the 8 maybe a hair less.","I went with the 8 for this reason, but was left with a lot of extra room/fabric under my bust.","This was easily concealed under the pop over, but just felt loose up top the whole night.","It was more of a watermelon color too, but a great color.","I received so many complements, but was very self conscious about the wrinkling of the fabric across my hips and was constantly pulling it down the whole night.","The dress had nice give in the fabric but just not enough for it to lay nicely.","I would suggest if youre built like me to rent with caution."
"8.0","I wore this for my birthday, and my best friend kept telling me I looked like a princess.","This dress is so great.","Its of a satin-y material thats heavy enough where you dont have to worry about bra bumps or underwear lines showing.","The pattern is even prettier and more intricate in real life.","It easily goes from day to night with a cardigan or blazer.","The only thing was I had to wear a size up from my usual, so definitely get a larger back-up size.","If it didnt run small this dress would easily be 5 stars!"
"8.0","Very cute"
"8.0","I rented this dress for a birthday dinner date with my boyfriend since RTR sent me $30 .","I loved the design and the colors of it- thought it was really unique.","It is realllllly short though.","Like it was windy that night and I was constantly holding down the skirt so I didnt flash anyone.","I got away with not wearing a bra with it because Im pretty flat chested.","However the open back detail (which I loved) didnt give me a whole lot of support so I wish I would have planned ahead and got nude petals or something.","Other than that, great dress for the price.","Fits true to size."
"8.0","Underestimated the reviews about the dress fitting short in the back.","Felt self conscious wearing it to a summer wedding and dancing."
"8.0","THIS DRESS HAS POCKETS"
"8.0","Pretty blouse!","Loved the sleeves and the peplum.","However, the other reviewers were correct - There is NO give to this material!","Despite my better judgement, I ordered the 2 thinking that I could make it work (I am usually a 4) and would have to ultimately go up another size for it to be comfortable.","I will keep an eye out for a six..."
"8.0","I wore this to a happy hour event at a conference.","I felt very put together without being overdressed.","I did have to use hollywood tape to keep the V from being too deep but I am more modest than most."
"8.0","It is very tight on your Rump.","But it is flattering and very comfortable.","It stays up well and I was able to move very comfortable in the dress all evening."
"8.0","Based on other reviews, I ordered my regular size and a size up - ended up wearing my normal size because I wanted to be able to wear a normal bra (if you size up, the cut outs sit oddly).","Nice dress, the cut-outs added a point of interest.","Dress is plain, so accessories will be very important.","Photos of the dress are more coral than the dress itself - it was a barbie pink."
"8.0","Dress overall was cute.","As mentioned, the top fits a little large around the bust.","I normally wear a six but felt better in the four.","It has pockets which is awesome.","Overall, cute dress that is comfy."
"8.0","Overall its a tight fitting, but flattering on the chest.","Im 510 and ordered the Long, but just be prepared to only wear 2 heels MAX...otherwise itll be too short!"
"8.0","Easy to wear, and quite sexy; the size 4 was on the small side.","On the hanger it looked impossibly tiny.","If you are between sizes and have hips, Id definitely go up.","The cut out back is perfect and you can wear this with black heels and very simple jewelry."
"8.0","The dress was beutiful.","The tank style gold dress skims your body and doesnt have a waist line -  I didnt  lilke the way it hit me.It fit fine but I felt that I needed more structure.","I ended up wearing a different dress.","I would highly recommend rent the runway and this dress."
"8.0","I wore this to my work holiday party.","The color is beautiful, and has a gold accent along the lace that I didnt notice in pictures.","I received lots of compliments, the dress fit like a glove.","I am 58, and it was the perfect length.","I wore kitten heels along with it so the dress wouldnt sweep the floor.","I am usually a size 4, and thought the medium worked best.","I did have a problem zipping the dress up past the stitching along the waist while it was on me - I had to first zip it, then slide it over my head which was annoying, but after that the zipper worked just fine!"
"8.0","This dress is def low cut, so you absolutely will need tape to keep everything in.","Pockets were a huge plus.","Length is great for someone who is taller.","Got a LOT of compliments!"
"8.0","The dress is subtle but slimming!","I love it!","Its classic and the stripes are flattering in all the right places!","This dress is perfect when you want to look beautiful without being the center of attention.","Dress is well made and structured.","It is tighter on top and forgiving for pear shapes!!","Definitely wear with a statement necklace."
"8.0","I agree with other reviews, DO NOT BELT THIS DRESS!","Okay, so it runs small in general.","Although it has a lot of fabric and it is a big dress in that sense, the top where it zip is on the tight side.","So you should size up one size to be comfortable.","I am petite and felt the dress was a lot for my frame, but it was really pretty and fun!!","Its perfect for that baby bump.","I felt cute in it but, obviously it do much for the figure.","Still, I think this dress is very different.","I wore it with tan wedges."
"8.0","Its a pretty dress, but I think it would look better on someone taller."
"8.0","This is great when you want to look pulled together but still be really casual."
"8.0","Very Cute Dress.","A little longer than it looks.","Im 58 and this dress was basically knee length.","Not what I expected.","Very stretchy material though and beautiful pattern.","I planned on wearing it to a graduation party, but went with something else instead."
"8.0","I could have done w/ a size 0 and had it fit much more tightly, but the 2 was fine.","I got a lot of compliments.","Its subtly sexy.","You cant wear a regular bra w/ it though, I had one of those sticky ones."
"8.0","They didnt have the 4R available so the 6R was a little big around the bust but the quality of the dress was good.","The length was perfect with heels.","I thought it was black but it was actually a dark navy blue."
"8.0","Yes!","So much yes!","This was a last resort after my original ordered dresses were too big.","Thanks to the amazing customer service, I recieved three additional dresses for the wedding we attended.","The first two fit terribly and didnt allow me to wear undergarments and this dress came in the morning of the wedding.","Beautiful shine and shimmer with tons of Hollywood glamour.","It fit snug in the arms and made it tough to dance while also running short (510, so it essentially are to my ankles) but at this point, I didnt care.","Its too beautiful not to wear!","The dress offered stretch to be a bit forgiving but I also chose to wear two pairs of spanx to hide lumps and bumps.","I recieved TONS of compliments from friends and strangers.","I had never felt so beautiful!","Id also like to note that though the back drapes low, it is possible to wear a regular bra with it.","Just tuck the top of the drape into the strap!","Funny thing though, this was the exact same dress as the bridesmaids except theirs was in gold.","Slightly mortifying, but we had a great laugh!"
"8.0","I am usually a medium and sized up due to previous reviews.","Im glad that I did, because the large fit perfectly.","Zero give to this dress."
"8.0","I wore this to a black tie event for work.","It was very comfortable and flattering!","A sure bet..."
"8.0","Unfortunately i didnt wear this dress to my event.","It was a great dress and a BEAUTIFUL color but its not good for big chests."
"8.0","The dress fit true to size.","I am bigger on top than bottom, so the bust fit a size 10 and the hips were loose.","The back of the dress is beautiful.","I should have worn my hair up.","The bust is very fitted...","Enough so that I did not need a bra and I rarely go without a bra at my age!","Tons of compliments.","Perfect for summer wedding."
"8.0","This dress was so comfortable.","Although, I was a little toasty after dancing.","Its made with quality material and holds you in.","Dress it up with fun shoes and sparkly earrings.","I wore red stilettos.","Perfect for a winter wedding!.","Highly recommend for comfort, class and fun."
"8.0","I got a lot of compliments on the dress.","Its sunny and bright but not overpowering.","I wish it was a little shorter.","It hit below the knee for me so you have to wear pretty high heels."
"8.0","As per the other reviews, the top runs small and has deep neckline.","I was able to avoid that by not folding down the fabric to make the V neckline and it worked very well.","This was extremely comfortable and looked great with cute light brown oxford flat shoes."
"8.0","I had fit issues with the bust and the length"
"8.0","I rented this dress for a gala and loved it for a classy basic dress.","I am usually between a M and L in dresses and the L ended up being a little loose in the stomach but was super comfortable!","I am 6ft tall and the length was great in heels!","It was not a stand out dress but I loved the color and would rent it again!"
"8.0","This sweater was cute, but it was cut really small.","Im 53 and wear a size 2/4 and I thought it was too short and way more snug than sweaters I usually wear.","I am rather busty so it may have looked a tiny bit longer if I was smaller chested, but still probably too short.","I still wore it and just kept tugging on it because I felt if I didnt youd see my belly button.","The fit was also really form fitting.","I by no means like big baggy sweaters, but I personally felt a little self conscious sitting down after dinner and Im a thin person!","I never wear a large, but would definitely get a large next time for a more normal sweater feel."
"8.0","Didnt end up wearing this... there was some problems with my original dress and this was sent as a backup backup!","Ha!","This dress ended up having a stain on it which broke my heart because it was SO fun!","The details are really nice!","The only complaint was the coloring was not ideal for my skin tone (and it being winter, oy!)","and the lining under the dress stops at your upper thigh which caused a weird bump there.","The material definitely shows everything so if you are slightly concerned about that...this isnt the dress for you!","I still wouldve rocked it if it didnt have a stain though!"
"8.0","The dress was a good fit- probably a 4 may have fit better but 2 fit fine.","The necklace that us recommended to match works perfect."
"8.0","I loved the neck cut out on this dress.","It shows your curves in all the right places.","Unfortunately, Im a bit too much of a pear to make it work just right.","If I were a half a size smaller on the bottom and a half a size bigger on top it would have been perfect.","I didnt end up choosing this for my event but was kind of sad it didnt work out."
"8.0","The bra area didnt fit well.","I had to end up not wearing a bra since I wouldnt stop it from showing.","Its very easily wrinkled and I didnt have time to get it steamed, but it still looked great!"
"8.0","This dress was definitely cute, tight on top so I didnt need to wear a bra.","The hem was coming undone (hence the 4 stars) at the bottom but I just ironed and hairsprayed it and that fixed it for essentially the entire night.","Im 55 and wore an 8 and I was worried when I sat down/stood up about my tush being visible but just walking around I dont think it was too short.","Great if its hot out!"
"8.0","I loved this sweater, the color and style is so simple but unique.","I wore it around all Saturday and my only complaint is that it seems to stretch out and get baggier as the day goes on, if I had known this I might have gotten a size down - but its still very comfortable and great looking!"
"8.0","I usually wear an 8 but needed the 10 because the 8 was a little too tight and a little too short for a wedding."
"8.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress because it was too small and I didnt order a back up size (my fault, big mistake!)","but it was a fabulous dress and I would order it again (in the correct size :-)) for a party or night out.","The material was thick and would probably be forgiving in the right size.","Order up and enjoy ladies!"
"8.0","Very cute dress.","Perfect for a casual event, I wore to a daytime wedding and was comfortable in it."
"8.0","The color was gorgeous.","I ordered the 10R, but it was unavailable, so RTR sent me the 12R.","Luckily I got the 12R, because the band around the middle fit perfectly on my ribcage, and a smaller size would probably have been too tight.","Also at 54 the dress was a little long, even with heels, so I had to be careful not to trip.","Finally, the bust was a little loose on my right side, in a way that suggested a stitch was missing.","Despite the fit issues, I did like this dress and got a lot of compliments."
"8.0","Only issue was the cape is a little heavy and kept falling off my shoulder.","Also those hanger strings kept popping out all night.","Nothing a little tape cant fix!","Overall loved it and will def recommend!"
"8.0","The material is very comfy but a little heavy.","Even wearing the smaller size the dress was a little big but mostly in the chest area.","I had to continually reposition and pull the dress down."
"8.0","Based on the other reviews and my hourglass figure, I was worried this dress would be too tight in my usual size.","I ordered both a size 4 and a size 6, worried about how they would look.","I was pleasantly surprised!","I wore the 6, as the 4 was too tight on my hips.","Although the 6 was a tad too large in the bust, the overall look was extremely flattering.","The thick material gives the dress a smooth, tailored look that was very slimming.","I received lots of compliments on the unique neckline and the effect the dress had on my figure!","It was a great color for a December wedding."
"8.0","It fit great and was perfect for what I wanted.","I wore it with a cardigan but could have done just as well without.","This was rented for a September wedding.","The color and cut were perfect for what I wanted.","Material is thick and the dress seemed good quality and well made."
"8.0","True to size,runs a bit short, I am 56.","The back as others have mentioned, doesnt stay flat.","Had to add invisible tape to hold it down, otherwise, it looks like wings.","Nevertheless, had a lot of compliments and had a great time wearing it."
"8.0","I received this as a backup after the dress I ordered didnt work out.","Its a gorgeous color and the style is really flattering!","It definitely runs large and I would have preferred a size 10, but this worked out fine.","Its a pretty light fabric and would be more suitable for spring/summer events."
"8.0","The dress does run a tad small, spanx do help, I ordered a 4 and a 6 and wore the size 6.","You cant tell from the picture but there is gold threading throughout the lace, good to know for planning your jewelry, shoes and purse."
"8.0","fit great, looks adorable - perfect for the after party!"
"8.0","Loved the color!","I received many compliments on the dress.","I only gave it 4 stars for two reasons.","1) The lining under the lace made it a bit restrictive and it would also bunch up at times.","2) The straps were very loose (especially when sitting down and not sitting perfectly upright) and by the end of the night they were slipping off my shoulders.","Other than that its a beautiful dress and fun to wear!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to a Saturday afternoon bridal shower over the summer.","Received a ton of compliments on the print and dress in general.","The fit was exactly what youd expect based on the picture.","Being a mom, I have the worrisome middle area, but this dress did well at concealing that with a lighter slim-wear underneath.","My only comment, stressing its a minor point and more personal preference, would be around the shoulder areas.","I felt like I have a bit of extra fabric in the chest and shoulder area to the point where I was continually pulling down the dress to avoid a football look."
"8.0","Dress fit true to size and I didnt need to wear a bra.","So many compliments on fit and color.","Matched with nude pumps.","Only issue is sitting down- the dress tends to ride up pretty high!","Overall I definitely recommend this dress for an event or wedding!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to a disco party and got tons of compliments.","I felt like the dress was a bit on the big side, but certainly not so much that I would have wanted to size down for fear of being too tight.","I am 5 4 and it was short but not obscene.","I liked how the sequins had a shiny and dull side but I did try and align them all the same direction."
"8.0","Searched through these rental pages for what seemed like forever.","Needed something for an Ohio winter wedding.","A little sexy, but still conservative enough for a church ceremony.","Loved the color and the neckline was beautiful!","Unfortunately, I have really narrow shoulders and this just kept falling down revealing well... the girls.","I could have gotten away with fashion tape for sure.","Also, the sleeves were too long on me and pretty baggy.","I ended up wearing a different dress to the ceremony for ease.","My husband still says this was his favorite."
"8.0","I ordered the 8R and the 6R - I wore the 6R for the extra support in the bust.","Quick warning - there were few options for a bra with this style.","Make sure you are comfortable with the little bit of extra exposure."
"8.0","I got the 4R and 6P.","The 4R fit better in the top, but I ended up wearing the 6P because the length was better and since it was a rainy day I wanted to avoid the dress dragging on the ground.","Its definitely very cleavage-y but I still felt covered enough, even though the 6 was a bit big in the straps/chest.","It was a beautiful dress for a late summer, black tie optional wedding!"
"8.0","This is a fabulous dress!","I loved the color and the fit.","I wore it with nude pumps.","I wish I wouldve done an up-do.","You hair gets caught easily in the sequins and by the end of the night my hair underneath was kind of knotted and ratty from getting caught in the sequins.","Overall, I was happy with my choice."
"8.0","The dress is super sparkly and formal looking.","It was comfortable and the length was perfect.","I did a high bun and it really showed off the one shoulder look.","Loved it"
"8.0","Cute top, but overall fit was a little boxy on me."
"8.0","Originally was going to wear the 12, because it have me more space for my broad shoulders and not-so-petite upper arms, but the belly was too loose.","So, I squeezed into the 10, which fit perfectly except for the upper arms and shoulders.","However, the dress is very forgiving and flattering.","I got so many compliments all night- loved it.","This dress is great because it is sexy and attention-grabbing for sure, but the long sleeves and knee-length made it appropriate for a black tie wedding with family present.","Overall, it was great, and Id definitely recommend this dress to a friend."
"8.0","This was an additional dress I ordered, but I ended up wearing it due to damage on my first choice.","I really ended up liking it!","The navy is beautiful.","I am 57 and ordered the 4L, it ran true to size and worked with 3-4 inch heels (did not reach the floor, but looked fine).","If youre debating between two sizes, go with the smaller one, as Im normally on the verge of, or wear a 6 with most other dresses.","I think I saw in other reviews that this dress baby-bump friendly and Id believe that.","Theres ruching around the stomach and the material is quite comfortable and stretchy.","The only problem I had with the fit is that the arm hole was pretty snug, so the sequins wore under my arm."
"8.0","This pretty much fits true to size, maybe a tiny bit smaller in the sleeves.","It was very flattering, no gaping at the chest like most blouses.","Very unusual color and subtle asymmetrical texture on the front, making for a very work appropriate but stylish blouse.","Would definitely rent again."
"8.0","Loved the dress.","It was WAY more fitted than it looks on the model.","If you want it to be loose Id order a size up.","It was also not as short as it was on the model (which was nice)."
"8.0","I wore this for a family wedding in May in Chicago - my son was ring bearer and my husband was a co best-man.","I was a reader.","I felt this dress was nice for the occasion, I just wished it wasnt such a bright color.","Otherwise it was perfect for the event.","COLOR: The dress is definitely red.","I was hoping it would look more coral based on the pictures I saw on here.","It photographs very differently depending on the lighting.","The lining is beige and the lace is red red.","FIT: When I first received the rental I was worried the dress would be far too short for me, I am 57/58ish.","There is no wiggle room, the fabric is not stretchy at all.","However, I felt the style of the dress was pretty flattering on my body type (pear shape), and likely most body types.","It accentuated the smallest part of my waist and flared out a bit at the hip so it was slightly forgiving in that area.","I ended up feeling pretty comfortable in it despite the length.. even while toting around my toddler.","CONS: The lace definitely appears worn up close.","Having the dress arrive wrinkled was also disappointing.","OVERALL: I felt this was totally worth it...","I ended up wearing a much nicer dress than I could have purchased in that price range.","I would definitely, definitely rent from RTR again."
"8.0","I didnt choose this dress as it appeared more casual than one of the other dresses for the wedding I was attending.","It was very cute on and I loved the color."
"8.0","Even though it was sequins, you still didnt feel too blingy to be professional.","One other guests cardigan got caught on my dress, but thats only because we were pressed in together like sardines for cocktail hour!"
"8.0","Wore this to brunch for a family event.","Shoulders were a little tight, I had to stand up really straight!","The fabric breathes nicely even though it has several layers.","The lace has a nice sheen!","Cant wear a bra with the back and neckline, but its quite supportive."
"8.0","The upper arms were slightly tight but other than that it was true to size"
"8.0","I wore this for my sororities formal and it was a great choice!","I am 51 and curvy (pear  shape) it was very flattering however I couldnt wear heels so it was very long on me but it worked out to be fine!","Got  lots of compliments on the color as well!"
"8.0","I rented this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner at a nice restaurant in Manhattan in early May.","I liked that it had longer sleeves because the temperature was due to be a bit chilly.","Ultimately, I chose this dress because I really felt like it screamed NYC.","Upon reading the reviews I felt conflicted, because some said to size up because of the skirt, and many said to size down because the top is loose.","In the end, I ordered a 4R (more or less my size) and a 2R (honestly that was probably wishful thinking).","The skirt *was* short and tight...I feel like it would have really prevented me from dancing comfortably had that been on the agenda.","It was OK to sit down and stand up at dinner, but I did feel a bit self-conscious.","In hindsight I should have sized up, as my thighs and butt are on the more athletic size, compared to my upper half.","I cant say if the top would have been *too* loose had I ordered the 6.","That being said, rent this when you want to wear something different and chic - but probably size up if you have an average female figure and not super petite!","Oh, also, it arrived somewhat wrinkled so I did my best to steam them out.","Its a delicate material in that way."
"8.0","There is boning in the bodice that was really tight on bust on the size 6 (causing really weird bust effect) so I had to up-size to the 8.","But the shoulders and armpits were really big on the 8, but it was the lesser of two evils.","So if you are busty, go up a size."
"8.0","Beautiful dress!","Vibrant color!","I really enjoyed dancing the night away in this dress.","A little challenging if you want to get low dancing to Shout!","but it was quite comfortable throughout the night."
"8.0","Received several compliments on this unique dress!","The only down side is the dress is very delicate.","Overall I was super pleased with this dress!"
"8.0","I loved this color, I loved the scalloping along the hem.","It was the perfect NYE dress.","But the fit across the shoulders was a little tight: theres not a lot of give to this fabric and it was a little rough along my collarbone.","This was my first RTR dress and I think it was a good pick!"
"8.0","I wore this for a wedding in the Adirondacks and I loved every minute of it.","The open back is sweet, and the colorblocking is perfectly on trend.","The dress was not too heavy or too tight except in the neck.","It was giving me a red mark that I had to consistently keep pulling on which was annoying - but really not enough of a drawback to not want to keep this dress forever!"
"8.0","My favorite thing about this dress was the bold fabric.","I did not love the shape of this dress which was a bit baggier than I expected.","On my petite frame the dress fell just above my knees and there was not much a waist line to speak of created by the boxy cut.","Perhaps a smaller size would have alleviated these issues."
"8.0","A perfect day to night dress.","Perfect with scrappy flat sandals for day and heels at night."
"8.0","This dress was super cute.","The open back is a really cool touch.","The shoulders/back was a bit big, but with double side tape, you can totally make it work."
"8.0","I love this jacket!","The fabric is so nice, the pattern is much more complex than what you can see in pictures (theres actually black, white, and red) and it also has a nice texture.","The buttons are made of a very thick felt-like material.","The pockets are a great size for a jacket.","It is very warm.","Only con is that it runs small.","I am usually a 38, I rented a 40 based on previous reviews to be safe, and I couldnt comfortably close it.","It looked great open though, but if you definitely want to close it, think about sizing up."
"8.0","I ordered both the 8 and the 10 as I am a 8 on top and a 10 on bottom.","The 10 was MUCH too large for me to wear on top but the dress has a nice amount of stretch in it and I could easily wear the 8 overall.","I felt sexy!","Easy to wear a strapless bra with this and even some more high-waisted spanx or underwear.","It was a forgiving dress.","It is a thicker material, so be aware of that."
"8.0","I wore this dress for a black tie gala/awards presentation during which I was a presenter.","I felt elegant AND comfortable in this dress.","I tend to wear size 14 on many RTR dresses, but I wore the 12P this time!","The zipper was a pain, but thats the only complaint I had about this dress.","I loved the green detail and the little bit of sparkle in the lace.","I would definitely order this again!"
"8.0","The fit was spot on and the dress was so comfortable!"
"8.0","The cut and fabric of this dress are super cute!","Unfortunately being taller I wasnt really comfortable wearing this since the front is so  much shorter than the back.","I tried to style over leggings or jeans, but it just didnt work for me."
"8.0","I wore this dress both to a dinner date and to a bachelorette party.","It was very comfortable and I loved the color.","I wore a 6, which was a bit big at the waist but fit everywhere else.","I probably could have worn a 4, but the sleeves on the 6 were already snug.","This was my first rental, and I am very happy with how it turned out!","I would consider renting this dress again."
"8.0","Fun and cute mixed media to change things up a little.","No fit whatsoever from the waist down, so definitely comfortable (I wore it on a flight)."
"8.0","The skirt is a heavier material, so it stayed down in the breeze.","Very professional fit and I loved the color blocking.","Super soft and comfy - I would rent again!"
"8.0","Great dress!","I got a ton of compliments on the fit and the look!","Just be aware it doesnt have a lot (if any) stretch.","Though it looked great I could have gone up like a half a size comfort-wise."
"8.0","I would rent this again."
"8.0","This dress was sent to me when the dress I originally ordered wasnt available.","I loved the color and the fit was super comfortable for a hot August outdoor wedding .","I am only 53 but the length was shorter than I expected with even modest heels.","I am also small busted so the top had to be secured with double-sided tape but the gathered fabric gave the illusion I was filling it out properly.","I felt great in the dress and would recommend for a lot of different body types."
"8.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress, though its gorgeous.","I love the playful peak-a-boo cutouts and the swanky bottom.","As far as the fit... it was a little big in all the wrong places.","The arms were really long!","I was puzzled by this and wish it werent the case."
"8.0","The fit and pattern is great.","I love NL.","However, based on the items in my closet this beautiful jacket was hard to match for my trip to HK.","I wore with a long, plain black maxi dress which looked great.","However the length was a little too short for a simple shirt and jeans (probably best with mid/high waisted items)."
"8.0","I ordered a 4 and a 6.","Couldnt even zip the 4!","The 6 fit like a glove, but the sleeves were too long.","If they got pushed up too much, the shoulders would be loose.","Other than that, it was a very pretty dress!","I did have scratches on my hands/wrists from the long sleeves rubbing on my skin, but it wasnt that bad."
"8.0","Very comfortable.","I had the 6 and the 4 and the 4 just fit a little better.","Lots of room in the hips.","The lace on one side was a little torn, but not noticeable.","The dress worked well sitting through dinner and dancing afterwards.","My husband......well.....lets just say he really liked it!"
"8.0","The dress was a little smaller then I thought it would be but I made it work with a pair of leggings underneath, otherwise, Id rent again!"
"8.0","Like others, I have to mention that this dress is really warm.","Its fully lined and it would be an absolutely amazing dress for a winter event.","It was cool and rainy in Pittsburgh for most of the night of my event so I didnt even need to bring a jacket which was nice!","I usually wear a 16-18 but only the 20 was in stock and Id read it ran a little small.","It was pretty big in the waste/bodice but I think the 18 wouldve fit just right.","The dress looks pretty teal in person but in photos it ranges from green to teal to some shades in the middle.","The lace look is gorgeous and the dress really is striking in a sea of black dresses!","I would definitely recommend it, especially if you get the size right!","It was also on the longer side for me, an inch or two above the knee.","Im guessing on a shorter woman it might feel too long."
"8.0","I rented this dress for a presentation I did for work.","The girls running the event are always super stylish so I wanted to wear something fun, but still look professional.","And for once I wanted to wear some COLOR instead of typical black or neutrals.","I ordered a size 6 and 8.","The night before the event I tried on the 8 and was a little worried.","The sleeves fit well but the skirt belled out A LOT.","I looked like a ballerina or a wedding cake topper!!!","But I figured this is what Ive got so Ill make it work.","The next morning, I tried on the size 6.","The arms were a little tight on me at first but the skirt was way less full than the 8.","I felt a million times better and more confident.","This is a wrap dress and the other reviews are accurate that the top gaps in the chest area.","There was no way I could tie it tight enough to prevent this from happening.","So I ended up wearing a cream lace bandeau underneath and used some double-sided tape to secure the top shut.","( A safety pin wouldve been better though.)","The top part of the dress is like a jersey cotton, which is different than the skirt.","It was a little faded on the dress I got.","The nice part about the fabric on the bottom of the dress was that it did not wrinkle easily, so this dress would probably work well if youre traveling.","I thought the print was fun/young but still professional.","The color was red/burgundy/navy with cream between the circles.","I wore nude heels and pearl jewelry.","I got lots of compliments on this dress.","And it has pockets!","Ill definitely rent DVF again."
"8.0","Im not big on floral designs but I wanted to wear a dress that was pretty, a bit sexy, but mostly girly for a baby shower.","I felt very feminine in this dress and the length (hit just a tad above my knee) was conservative enough.","However,...the set of hooks that controls the cleavage were missing!","Without them I had major cleavage going on - I wouldnt have been able to wear this dress at all had I not found a small safety pin.","Also, the ruffles were wrinkled and folded over my chest (I dont own a steamer iron).","So overall, it was a beautiful dress but I was somewhat disappointed with the state of the dress."
"8.0","Really fun dress and overall was flattering for my busty, apple shape.","The fabric around the bust is white on one side and sometimes it would fold over which I didnt love.","The fabric is cotton and wrinkles a little bit, but it works for the style."
"8.0","This dress was nice and I liked the fit.","The dress sent to me definitely showed signs of wear... like an unraveled hem and the ruching had been ripped a bit.","Overall it was fine but I wish the dress I had gotten hadnt so aggressively used by other renters."
"8.0","Such an elegant dress.","The red was perfect, just like the picture showed.","The bust of the dress was a little large, even tho I wear a C cup, but the structure of the dress looked natural on me and help up nicely.","I didnt have to pull just dress up once.","The waist fit perfect as well.","Although I did read in most reviews that the dress ran long.","So I ordered a petite and wore my biggest heels, but the dress was still almost a whole foot too long.","Yes literally a foot.","I used two sided fashion tape and a couple safety pins to hem it up.","I contemplated just getting credit for the dress cause I didnt want to deal with it but everyone in my family said I didnt have a choice because the dress was so beautiful on me.",":)"
"8.0","I enjoyed this little jacket great color kind of a lipstick red beautiful soft leather, slightly boxy fit.","I enjoyed wearing it and my husband could always find me in a crowd!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to a New Years Eve wedding and received a lot of compliments.","My only complaint (as others have noted) is that it is pretty long.","It hit around bottom of my knee (but Im very short)!","Color is wonderful and back of the dress is to die for!"
"8.0","Received this as a backup dress for a black tie wedding.","It hangs beautifully, fit well, and felt and looked very quality.","It just wasnt the right look for the occasion.","I would recommend it for a more conservative affair.","Pairs well with either silver or gold jewelry."
"8.0","I was worried the lace would look a little too formal for a day time event, but the dress was easy to dress up, with nice heels, or down with a cute pair of wedges or sandals.","Lace was beautiful and it fit perfectly!"
"8.0","Lately i am between a 6-8 and the medium fit like a glove.","The dress has some stretch to it and was pretty comfortable.","I received many compliments and probably would have received more but my cardigan covered a lot of the dress."
"8.0","Size down, its overall a large fit.","Im a hourglass and busty (34E) and the size 40 (2) fits me great along the bust and shoulders, lots of room straight down.","Heavier fabric, very comfortable.","It may be a bit long for my height but I dont care because this dress is darling.","The only reason Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the zipper isnt budging.","I had to pull it over my head, which worked okay, I was grateful.","Keep that in mind in case you order it!"
"8.0","I wore it without a bra and it was a little bit loose on top (even though I am a 34 D), but it worked.","Pockets were a great addition.","It is very flattering.","creates shape without cling.","The brocade pattern is beautiful and the gold is not super shiny.","I wore it with a nude suede sandal, but it also looked cute with gold shoes."
"8.0","We did not wear this dress because my cousin rented the same one in red, but it fits perfectly and the colors are vibrant!","The fit is very classic, it gives a great natural waist."
"8.0","As I mentioned, many people loved this dress, however, it was not one of my personal favorites.","As mentioned in other reviews the arms did seem to run small.","My arms are one of my pain points on my body and I consider myself to have bigger arms.","So as long as you do not consider yourself to have bigger arms I am sure the fit will be just fine.","I did add a small waist belt to give the waist area some definition as this was not the most flattering dress in my opinion.","Overall, it was a great dress and it was perfect for an outdoor fall ceremony."
"8.0","You need the sticky tape, trust me...Other than that this dress was definitely a show stopper!"
"8.0","I received a size 6 and a 4 for my backup.","The 4 fit better in the midsection, but it was WAY too short.","The 4 was a good inch shorter than the 6.","The 6 fit well, but it was a bit baggy in midsection.","It wasnt a big deal though.","If I could, I would definitely buy this dress one day.","Its beautiful!","I would warn that if youre taller than 54, this dress might be hard to wear due to the mini length.","It hit me mid thigh and I do not have long legs at all."
"8.0","The fit throughout the body was perfect.","I had to use some dress tape to keep the top of my bra from showing.","I think this would have been less of a problem for a larger bust.","The layering in the tummy area kept everything looking awesome.","I would wear this dress again.","Loved it."
"8.0","im typically btwn 2 and 4, got the 2 and it was a little large, but shld be fine for a dress this style.","my biggest issue was that it looked like maternity wear on me because my boobs pushed the front of the dress forward, creating a tent.","adding a wide belt helped, but thats not the look i was going for.","i found the neck and everything else to fit well.","the inner liner goes almost all the way to the hem and wasnt very flowy so it didnt allow for longer strides.","hit right above my ankles.","the pleats were great and i loved the pattern and colors.","if i didnt had a chest i wldve ordered a smaller size and it wldve looked the way it does on the model.","i would not recommend this for anyone larger than a B cup, but thats my personal preference."
"8.0","I go back and forth between a Medium and Large and the 10 fit perfectly (I ordered a 12 as back-up and it fit but it was just a little too boxy).","I did have to use body tape to keep the sleeves actually off my shoulders, though.","But the body tape worked perfectly.","I paired it with a black pencil-thin short skirt and black kitten heels - perfect!","And I wore a big chunky pink and silver necklace that really set off the top, with my hair up.","I would definitely wear it again!"
"8.0","I liked the dress but for my body type (a little curvy) I had to add a belt to make it look more fitted.","After I added the belt, I REALLY liked it.","It did ride up a little sometimes but I think that is because I have a little bit of fuller hips.","All in all, the print is awesome and the belt made it work on me."
"8.0","This dress is comfortable; it makes you feel glamorous but sexy.","Obviously the back of the dress is the show-stopper.","You dont need to wear a bra with it... it has built in cups.","Fits true to size so that your girls can sit right."
"8.0","Its not super fitted hrough the midsection, so if youre not super thin, could add unnecessary bulk."
"8.0","The red is stunning.","The dress fit perfectly.","I normally never wear long dresses, or red but wanted to get out of my comfort zone.","I am really glad I did because I loved this dress.","Only issues were the zipper was nearly impossible to zip.","There was no issue with the size, it was just a really difficult zipper and took a little sweat and struggle to get up.","Also, I am 54 I wore pretty high heels and the regular was still a bit long.","Other than that I loved it!"
"8.0","Fun flouncy feel to it.","Great vibrant color.","Silky soft material.","This was very fun to wear at the office.","Definitely a stand out piece."
"8.0","I am normally a size 4 and that fit well.","I could also fit the size 2 but the 4 just looked better.","The only problem with my dress was that the stitching came out on the right sleeve so the hem kept sticking out.","It was annoying since it looked like the dress was cut funny and I kept tucking that part in but it just kept coming back out.","The dress color is also darker than I thought.","When you take pictures with a flash it comes out like the color pictured on the model.","The material is also thicker than I thought so it can work for cooler, outdoor events."
"8.0","was super short and tight, so wasnt appropriate for my event.","but with heels and black tights this could be great for a fancy date."
"8.0","I actually thought both the 4 and 6 fit me, but ended up wearing the 6.","This dress is so comfortable, its amazing!","It is also more flattering than I thought it might be (I was worried I would look shapeless).","The sequins were in good condition on both sizes, and my ony complaint is that i wish it was a tad shorter (im only 52, so the 6 came down to graze the top of my knee.)","This was my first time renting the runway and i am SO glad I did!","I styled it with red nail polish and red satin shoes (i know, it sounds garish, but it actually looked really sweet and nice!",")."
"8.0","Love the feel of the silk.","Adorable boho esk shirt.","The only thing that is not perfect is the v is a little low."
"8.0","I usually wear a small and this size small was too small and the medium was very tight.","This was my least favorite just in case that I received when I learned my initial rental was not going to be sent.","Disappointed that this was the one that was sent.","Didnt end up wearing and went with the other dress I had rented from RTR."
"8.0","The sleeves were too tight in the 6 (couldnt safely get in), so the 8 it was.","When I look at pictures I feel like this looked better in person than the pictures (but I did get a lot of compliments)"
"8.0","Fit was great.","I wore low (1 1/2 heels), so dress was a little long, probably should have ordered 8R."
"8.0","I wore this dress to brunch in NYC for a friend of a friends birthday.","The dress is amazing and fits like a glove.","I received compliments all day long about this dress, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a dress that is form fitting and flattering."
"8.0","Beautiful dress but the bust area is way too big.","Also, be ready to show some major cleavage because the neckline is really low.","Otherwise a great dress."
"8.0","It fit true to size, was an appropriate length (though it rode up a little when I sat down), and was flattering.","The sleeves rose up a little bit, but overall it was comfortable.","It was a feminine, unique dress; I would definitely recommend it."
"8.0","For work I had to wear a tank underneath so it wasnt so revealing"
"8.0","It looked great overall, but if youre pear-shaped, it does accentuate wide hips a bit."
"8.0","Cute but a little ill-fitting for a petite frame."
"8.0","I rented two dresses and this  is the one I didnt wear for the event.","I would say it was just OK in the style department.","Cute up top but the way the pleats fell made my hips look extra wide.","The quality and color are spectacular.","I would recommend this for smaller hips."
"8.0","I love jumpers and this one is extremely flattering.","I got a ton of compliments from people.","I will say I normally wear a 4 but I definitely couldnt have worn smaller as the torso would not have fit.","The length was great and it even has zippers at the bottom of the legs to help get you in.","People have talked about the zipper and it isnt terrible to do by yourself but its not super easy as it goes all the way up the back so it gets a little awkward in the middle.","All of that being said I would definitely rent this again!"
"8.0","Not tight, true to size or a tiny bit large.","Not the sexiest dress Ive rented from RTR, but still a reliably elegant AND fun dress for a party.","Got lots of compliments."
"8.0","Love this dress, unfortunately I could not wear to work as I had planned.","I loved the shape and the style of the dress, it fit comfortably and the wrap is very flattering.","But, like the other reviews state, the top is a bit low.","If I had had fashion tape I would have worn as the quality and style is beautiful.","May rent for something more casual this summer."
"8.0","Dress fit well and hugged hips in all the right places."
"8.0","Worn for a wedding rehearsal dinner.","A little short for my 59 frame, and a tidge tight in my chest, but was so fun and flattering, who cares?","This dress creates the look of a small waist, and shows off nice arms and shoulders.","Throw on a pair of fun shoes and a bracelet, and the compliments will just keep coming.","If you are tall avoid bending.","If you have a big chest, wear a minimizer bra and avoid big breaths, a small price to pay for a night of this cute."
"8.0","I usually wear a size 4 but I ordered both a 4 and a 6.","The 4 fit but the 6 was more flattering and more comfortable.","This was my first time ordering from RTR and it was a great experience.","I would definitely do it again!"
"8.0","Sized down because the dress ran a little wide and was very low cut.","I have a long torso though so sizing down meant it was very short.","It worked for this event but I never could have worn this to a wedding or anything requiring something more conservative due tithe length.","Also, the sequins were itchy and the dress was very heavy."
"8.0","The ONLY problem I had with the dress was the bra area.","It does not have any padding or cups but it works picture with sticky boobs!","overall, I highly recommend this dress!"
"8.0","The fit on this jacket is great.","It is made from a great heavy material and is perfect for work.","It has pockets which are handy but if you are petite (Im shorter waisted and longer legs), the pockets may hit at the wrong part of your hips actually making ones hips look puffy.","If you are sensitive to that, this may not be for you.","Otherwise, its great."
"8.0","I am usually a size 4, but wore this less than 2 weeks post-partum and it worked great.","At the time I was a 32H (!)","in the bust, wearing size 6 street clothes.","If youre planning to wear any sort of heel, get the long...the regular length is closer to petite (Im 55).","I wore a 2-inch heel and the dress length was perfect.","The gathers on the tummy area cover up any sort of pooch you might have but still has a flattering silhouette.","Great for larger busted women and bump-friendly."
"8.0","I ordered a 2L and a 4L.","They both fit, but the 2 was a bit short in length.","While the 4 wasnt as snug around the waist, it hung prettier.","The fabric is heavy and luscious."
"8.0","This dress runs large.","I am normally a size 4 and should have gone with a 0 in this dress.","I wore the 2 but it was definitely big, too much material gathered at the zipper.","If you are small on top consider sizing down.","But it still worked for my event -  I liked the polished look and that it was comfortable!","Definitely add a necklace to break up the white.","The material of the dress is quite thick, which is great as you cannot see any lines however it was also quite hot.","I did get many compliments as the dress has a beautiful design!"
"8.0","This dress was perfect for a fundraiser I recently attended for Newtown, CT.","The colors were beautiful in person, and I got compliments all night!","A few notes about the fit: you will need to wear a strapless bra (straps will show with a regular one).","Also, the chest area fit me a little funny.","I wasnt really able to fill out the dress with my chest size.","Howver, I dont think it was noticeable due to all the colors and pattern on the fabric.","This would probably not be a problem for someone with a larger chest :) Overall, it was a great rental and I was sad to see it go back to RTR!"
"8.0","This dress runs very large and I could have sized down for a better fit.","The collar is kind of dingy on the one I received and was disappointed to see this, but was able to still wear it anyway.","This is a comfortable dress that is very classy for the office and is sure to get you compliments.","I will definitely wear this one again sometime in the future."
"8.0","I really liked this dress, however the fit was a little odd.","It was really tight in the top, across the chest, however quite large from the waist down.","Perhaps if I went a size up the top would have fit better, but then I think the bottom would have been way too large.","It was flowy and fun to wear!"
"8.0","The dress is great, but was a little more snug than I usually wear -I also found myself pulling the dress down throughout the night.","Both the small and the medium fit because the fabric gives a lot, but I found the small way too snug and the medium just about right."
"8.0","Cute!","I didnt realize it had peppers on it until I wore it :-)"
"8.0","Beautiful dress, wore it for a gender reveal on the beach early in my pregnancy.","People asked if I was getting married the dress was that pretty and light."
"8.0","I sing with a band, and rented this gown for a recent performance.","I had room to breathe!","The draping gave me some extra room.","The first not itchy sequin dress Ive ever worn.","Just the right amount of cleavage.","My only complaint is that the zipper was nearly impossible.","It took 2 people to zip the dress, because one had to hold the top together while the other pulled downward on the bottom of the zipper.","Still, I am considering renting this dress again for a future performance!"
"8.0","This dress is great looking overall, but the fabric, zipper, stitching, etc.","are quite cheaply done.","I like the look, but it is built like something from a cheap store or catalog."
"8.0","Loved that this could easily be dressed down.","Both times I wore it I went from day to night.","Super comfortable and not see through at all.","Only four stars because it is not the most flattering jumper I have worn."
"8.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress, but it was very cute!","It was my runner-up dress.","It fit great, true-to-size and was comfortable, although pretty short (and Im only 54!)","I really wish I had been able to wear this for something else, but I will definitely consider renting it in the future!"
"8.0","As stated in other reviews, the dress runs a bit small with NO give.","I DID NOT WEAR.","I could get into the 10R but it was too snug for my taste."
"8.0","Adorable romper.","Tons of compliments.","It does run a tad big.","I am a solid 6 and the 4 was my back up and it was big..loved it!"
"8.0","Very Flattering.","Can dress it up or down."
"8.0","Fell in love with the color and overall style of this dress.","Love the textured detail and zippered ruffled back closure.","I ended up wearing the backup size which was too small because the extra small did not have much give in the bottom half but the extra small the top was perfectly fitted."
"8.0","It fit pretty well and I totally loved the stretchy material!","The sleeves and shoulders were the tightest part of the dress, which made me feel like a bra strap was always falling down, even though it wasnt.","Probably not great for broad-shouldered folks.","Also, it was a little plain and didnt really have any definition in the waist, so I added a belt which was super cute with it!","Also, it was a little blue-er than the picture showed.","It is definitely a dress that can be dressed up for fancy  occasions or dressed down, like I wore it for work."
"8.0","fit snug all the way through, length was perfect with a heel."
"8.0","It ran a bit large, especially in the bust.","I am a D cup and the bust was still very loose.","I had to pin it to avoid revealing way too much!","I would have felt a lot better if it came in a smaller size but I made the best of it!","I would definitely recommend it!"
"8.0","I really liked wearing this dress - it was comfortable without looking casual.","I agree with other reviews that it definitely runs long.","I could have worn 2-3 inch heels easily but chose to wear flats in the end.","It worked fine other than needing to be aware and lift it when walking and dancing.","It definitely fits small up top  - I have a small bust and it was great, lots of support and no need for a bra (good since a regular strapless bra would have shown in the back).","Im never sure if  I will be a 2 or a 4, but the 2 worked perfectly - other than being a little long.","I highly recommend it, especially if you have some fun accessories to color it up!"
"8.0","Unique details make this dress special.","Unfortunately, the zipper stuck (right on the seam), so it was hard to take on/off (and use the restroom).","Otherwise, fabulous!"
"8.0","This dress is gorgeous.","It hugs curves very well.","There was some extra room in the waist that came in handy after the wedding buffet and lots of drinks.","I wish I could give this a 5, but there were two holes in the dress that I didnt notice until I put it on for the event.","The hole in the hip was pretty noticeable and a distraction for me all night."
"8.0","Even though I didnt know a single person at this wedding, I still got compliments all night--from complete strangers.","My measurements are 44, 38, 44 and the size 16 was the best fit for me.","There is plenty of room in the bust area and the fabric is stretchy.","The only part of the dress that is tight is the waistband, and its the type of dress where the zipper buckles if the size is too small on.","The dress color is a light pink/cream color with rose gold sequins.","It also comes in black and navy(which I have also rented and LOVED)."
"8.0","It probably ran true to size, but Im sort of small busted, so it was a little too big.","I just used a little assist to fix it!"
"8.0","Too big in the bust and still a little long even with 5 inch heels.","Like other people have written, it is very unforgiving.","I have no stomach at all, but from certain angles the ruching on the stomach made it appear like I had a bit of a stomach.","It photographed great!"
"8.0","Wore this first trimester pregnant- was a great fit and really enjoyed the comfort!","Had to tuck my bra cuz pregnancy boobs didnt fit into strapless bra."
"8.0","The material is flawless.","I felt expensive just wearing it!"
"8.0","This dress is gorgeous and can easily transition from day to night.","I wore this dress with black tights and booties and was a great look!","The dress fabric is VERY thin"
"8.0","The under layer was a bit snug on my through the hips, but the outer layer helped cover that up.","Fit everywhere else was great.","I did leave enough time to iron some of the flowers, as other girls said in their reviews.","I was comfortable all night and felt great in this dress."
"8.0","Great print and very comfortable but just a little too short for me.","Had to wear with black tights and flats, not heels like I usually would with a dress like this."
"8.0","The dress was a bit tight, but did loosen up a little.","I called to order an XL instead of a Large (I wear a 8=10).","The XL was too big in the shoulders.","This fit me well except in the arms.","It was a little tight there."
"8.0","this dress is form-fitting and elegant.","fits very well.","it has those little bone wire kinda things in it so it stays up well!","im a little busty, so i had to wear a bra  with tape to keep it up.","it was a little long.","my heels were 3 and a half inches so if youre tall or are wearing very high heels this will be perfect!","loved this dress!"
"8.0","I wish I would have ordered a size 0.","This dress runs 1-2 sizes larger than your usual size (Im a 4 usually)."
"8.0","Venting on the side makes it less conservative, so be prepared for that"
"8.0","My only complaint was the long was VERY long.","Even with 3 heels it was still dragging the floor.","This dress also has a train so I was carrying it around all night.","I am a 36B/C and the top was a bit big.","I could have worn a 10 but it was not available for the night of my event.","Thank you Rent The Runway for my first rental!","It will NOT be my last!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to an outdoor wedding in New Orleans and It was perfect for the occasion.","The dress photographs beautifully and I received many compliments.","I ordered the dress in a 4 and 6.","The 4 fit my chest (32C) but was a little snug in the booty; Im usually between a 27 and 28 in jeans.","I decided to go with the 6 for a looser fit since I knew we would be out dancing all evening in the French Quarter.","I did have to use tape since the 6 was too big on top but no one noticed.","Bottom line, the dress is gorgeous and I would buy or rent again."
"8.0","I really liked the color of this top and the fabric was also awesome.","However, the drape around the chest is a little weird.","It sort of folded over and wasnt a crisp line.","If you look that look, Id recommend because otherwise its a great top!"
"8.0","This dress has beautiful fabric and a great fit, but it turned out to be too dressy for me to just wear around.","I even tried it with very casual shoes and a belt, but couldnt make it work.","I have a casual life and can usually dress down most things; this wasnt one of them."
"8.0","This dress is really pretty, but very tight in the top- I agree with what a lot of other ladies have said about how it fits!","I could barely breathe all night!","It also wasnt the most flattering fit for my body type (straight, athletic, broad shoulders)."
"8.0","I rented this to wear to work.","It was extremely flattering yet very work appropriate.","The way the dress is cut it adds some extra curves.","It make a your waist look smaller too!"
"8.0","I ordered the Size 4 as a backup but did not need to try it on because the 6 fit perfectly.","Very comfortable and well-made."
"8.0","The dress is very comfortable, and even has clips at the shoulders to hold your bra straps in place under the dress!","Only reason the dress did not get a 5 is because of the fit.","I usually wear a 4, but had to wear a 6 because the 4 was too tight in the hips.","The 6 was a little loose in the top, but overall worked well."
"8.0","This dress had so many good reviews I was excited to wear it.","I normally wear a ten but that was way too big and the eight was a little large as well.","I ended up pinning the top of it since Im not well endowed enough to fill it out.","If I rent it again Id definitely order a six.","I liked how the skirt fell as it hid any trouble spots, but was really glad I paired it with really high heels since the skirt fell longer on me due to my height.","I did receive a lot of compliments on it and some from people I didnt even know at the semi-formal party."
"8.0","Fit was true to size.","The fabric was bit heavier than I expect but it worked out well since the wedding was outside and very chilly!","I loved the pockets and would recommend for a winter or fall event."
"8.0","First off, major kudos to the RTR customer service team!","The original dress I ordered fit me like a potato sack, and the live chat rep helped me nail down a replacement dress for next-day delivery in 15 minutes!","This was my fifth or sixth backup choice and they only had it in the next size up.","Still, it was perfect for my local TV appearance.","Pros: I fell in love with this dress the more I looked at; its not a showstopper, but it gets the job done.","It fits true-to-size, and even though the size 6 was a little loose on me, it didnt look baggy.","Also, I was worried after other reviewers mentioned cape-like sleeves, but the style was fine to me.","Cons: This is a sweet springtime dress, so Id wear it to a shower or graduation, but not a wedding or flashier event."
"8.0","The dress fit SO good!","It fit my body like a glove!","The bust area was a little uncomfortable so if you dont want to wear a bra, you might want padding or something in that area.","I got compliments all night with this dress!!","I enjoyed this dress a lot!"
"8.0","The fit was perfect.","I couldnt believe how well it worked it as soon as I slipped it on.","It was a little tight in the arms and I wasnt able to raise my arms up as much.","The material is fairly thick so I would stick with wearing in the Fall, Spring."
"8.0","Wore this for my daughters New years Eve wedding - a little big in the bust - had to pin it shut, othersie, great fit, flattering, etc.","Received lots of complements - hard to match shoes - the overall sequence make the dress look coppery, definitely not silver and not quite gold"
"8.0","I liked this skirt so much even though it was definitely too high-waisted for me.","I wore it anyway.","I was surprised at how thin the fabric was since this is wool.","The waist was a little tight, but the fit was fine everywhere else.","The side slits make the skirt more comfortable for walking and hit just above the knee, conservative enough for the office."
"8.0","I rented this as a backup for a gala I was going to attend.","I didnt wear it because my first choice ended up working out.","I tried this on, however.","I have sensitive skin and thought the sequins under my arms would cause irritation.","Cute dress, though!"
"8.0","Im a broad shouldered gal, and this made me look a tad more boxy on the top.","The slit at the top was too large for me to NOT wear a tank top.","I had a tough tie with the ties as well.","Just seemed to be a lot of extra fabric.","I did like how thick the fabric was though, as no fear of being see through the way so many things are these days.","Perfect outfit for Cinco de Mayo and very comfortable and overall flattering.","Great color too.","Multiple compliments too.","Great length for me as well, Im 54."
"8.0","This top is nice and soft and fits well.","I wore it with jeans and was happy with the fit.","Its a top thats pretty much as expected based on the pictures."
"8.0","Pros: The fabric is somewhat stretchy and has give, which is great for sitting, eating, dancing, etc.","The color is beautiful and definitely stands out.","I was able to move/lift my arms comfortably.","Great for busty women - Im a 34DD/DDD and it was perfect, not too revealing, the perfect combo of classy/sexy and appropriate for a wedding with family in attendance.","Cons: At 54 this dress was a tad long, which without very high heels, made me look a bit short - but with higher heels, it was perfect.","I have a short torso, so the straps were a little loose over the shoulders."
"8.0","Pros:- Its fun and great for summer days- Easy to accessorize and dress up and downCons:- Im petite so the dressed made me look a little big, but I added a thin belt and I was happy with the way it looked."
"8.0","Im using RTR for the first time, because I have a wedding in a month and a lot of events!","I got this dress for engagement photos.","The dress was a little tight for me, I probably should have tried an 8.","However, Im still very happy with how the photos turned out #raisingredphotography !"
"8.0","This dress is beautiful and was perfect for attending a black tie wedding.","I received many compliments and it was very comfortable.","Of course, I was OBSESSED with the pockets!",":)After reading the other reviews I ordered a size down from what I would typically wear.","The fit was great.","It was nice to be able to wear a regular bra with it though my bra band would peek out from the low V in the back every now and then.","Other reviewers mentioned that the zipper was difficult and I definitely would have to agree.","It was quite a struggle to zip and unzip.","It also was very wrinkled upon arrival but I was able to press it myself.","All in all, I loved the dress and would definitely recommend it!"
"8.0","This dress was absolutely beautiful.","The flow of the material and the small train were elegant and just what I was looking for.","A few notes:* I agree with the other reviews that this dress runs large (I typically wear a 6 but ended up using the 4).","* I highly recommend getting a belt to accentuate the waist.","Before the belt I added, the dress gave me no shape, but the belt added the definition I needed.","* As others have said, the color is more of a navy than a vibrant blue.","I would absolutely recommend this gown to others.","Classic elegance!"
"8.0","I wore this for a Black Tie Optional Wedding on Halloween.","It was my little Audrey Hepburn inspired outfit since I couldnt dress up and it was beautiful!","My only complaint was that I rented this and chose my shoes based off the reviews and the dress was clearly hemmed.","Im only 54 and had shoes that were a little over 3.5 in heel height and it was short on me.","I dont know why or how the dress was hemmed but it was obvious, the tag was sewn into the hem which means at least 2-3 inches must have been cut off the dress.","I made it work and when i took my shoes off it was fine but I did wish it hadnt been hemmed without notice.","Other than that complaint, the dress was beautiful, thick fabric perfect for a Fall wedding, wore my regular bra and spanx and got many compliments all night!"
"8.0","This was heavier than I expected; I was a bit warm at an outdoor summer wedding.","However, I received some compliments and I loved the pockets (though they did make me look a bit hippy).","It was a very comfortable dress once we got some air conditioning, the lace didnt itch at all, and the sleeves fit great (I have thicker-than-average arms and some sleeves are just too tight to be comfortable).","I wore a size 12 when I usually wear a 10 and had no problem dancing.","I paired it with nude heels and some sapphire drop earrings for fun and the combo was pretty awesome."
"8.0","I loved this jacket.","Wore it casual with a striped turtle neck and ripped boyfriend jeans.","the fit is very cool and i got lots of compliments.","A good piece to take some risks with."
"8.0","This is a really nice dress.","I am 6 feet tall and often have issues with dresses being to short but this length was great on me.","The dress is a little bit bluer that I thought it would be, i thought it was more of dark navy/black from the picture.","I will say the chest does run large and I had some issues keeping the top part in place all night.","but overall it was a perfect dress for a Black Tie Wedding in NYC."
"8.0","Fit well, but it was a little heavy."
"8.0","I lift weights, have broad shoulders and moderately large biceps so the shoulder area was tight on me and slightly cut into the front of my shoulder.","The 6 fit incredibly well though, I definitely felt very etherial in it.","Im 57 and the regular was the perfect length with flats."
"8.0","This top is very unique and fun.","It is islet fabric, so it is cool and breezy feeling.","The fit was wide across the chest though, 40 inches, so I used a safety pin to make a pleat in the back to narrow the silhouette.","Size two might be better but I wouldnt want it any shorter.","Always fun to take the tag off a brand new RTR item!"
"8.0","Great quality.","The dress fit really well.","It was a bit loose in the bust for me, but nothing 2 strips of fashion tape couldnt fix.","Beautiful, festive and sexy dress worn for a bachelorette party in Vegas."
"8.0","The coat is a nice everyday wear.","I prefer a heavier coat now that the cold weather is here."
"8.0","Dress fits nice overall.","Make sure you have a good strapless bra.","Pair with tall heels to lengthen the lines of the dress.","Only downside is the sleeve- I think the length is slightly awkward."
"8.0","Fit was true to size, very comfortable, very casual unless dressed up with accessories."
"8.0","I loved this dress!","It was my first time doing rent the runway, and I have to admit, I was a little scared because Im on the shorter side myself, but it all worked out perfectly!!","The only reason I gave the dress 4 stars was because it was a bit on the longer side, and it was a bit snug as well, but both of those things didnt make any difference in how the evening went.","The entire experience great, and everyone complimented the dress and told me I looked like a movie star!","Would definitely recommend!"
"8.0","The shade of blue is amazing and the style is gorgeous, plus the fabric just feels super high quality.","I added this dress to an existing order, so only got one size.","I normally wear an 8, 10 or 12 in dresses, depending on the designer and style.","Based on the reviews I went with a 12 to be on the safe side.","It was big in the top, and the full skirt was very forgiving in the waist/hips, so I definitely could have gone with a 10.","But it still looked great and I got lots of compliments.","The length was great, right above my knees since Im 52, but careful when you bend down/over, it gets real short, real fast!",";) The style was very me, so with that on top of the fit, it was really comfortable to wear all night.","Once upon a time the dress did have the little snaps to hold bra straps in place, but both on my dress were broken, so I wore a strapless bra, otherwise straps would have been showing anytime I moved.","Overall, I would totally get this dress again in the next size down.","Lots you can do for styling, I chose a big multi-strand pearl necklace, and a boa, because thats what you do at your bachelorette weekend, right?","Apologies for the mediocre photo, I forgot to get a full length one!",":)"
"8.0","I rented this romper for my free birthday rental with PRO.","The romper was very comfortable and cute.","It is actually something I would love to own.","It is easy to wear and can be worn for a lot of occasions.","I think this romper was better suited to a more casual event, something youd wear a casual summer dress to."
"8.0","This was a very comfortable dress to wear.","It runs a little large in the shoulders and bust but true to size elsewhere.","The fabric of the dress is thick and holds the shape of the very well.","Got many compliments especially about the detail on the top.","Overall a great dress.","I would definitely wear it again."
"8.0","A little on the short side and the lace was a bit smaller than the tan slip underneath (probably from being dry cleaned) so it shows at the bottom."
"8.0","I picked this dress because of the lace overlay look, to cover my tattoos and be more conservative.","I chose a 6L and 8L.","The 6L fit better, until I went to sit down.","Since the neckline is so high it became too tight around my neck when I sat down.","I wore the 8L only based on that, but then the sleeves were a bit too baggy.","Regardless of the little things, I really loved this dress and it was so easy to get and return the dresses.","I will def.","be using Rent The Runway in the future."
"8.0","I LOVED this dress and got sooo many compliments on it..but I did have to size up and wear the 18.","The zipper is tough to get past a certain point but once its up it fits perfectly.","I did not want to send this back!","It hid everything I wanted it to and I felt super comfortable all night.","I wore 4 heels with the dress and it was perfect.","I did switch into flats to dance, the dress was long but still very manageable.","I would highly recommend this dress."
"8.0","I wore this out while on vacation and the size was slightly larger than anticipated - even knowing that Free People tends to run large.","Another reviewer mentioned that she tied the back string around the waist and doing that really helped.","It was really flirty with the ruffles in the back, but the sophisticated neckline balanced everything out.","Suggest during the day with flats or with heels for a casual night out."
"8.0","It wasnt as short on me as it looks on the model.. probably because Im 51.","But overall, great dress and color in pictures!","This material did get a little hot, since we were in Mexico, but the material was stretchy and worked out in the end.","Looks great in pictures!"
"8.0","It was a tad big in the bust, but perfect in the waist!","Also, the back stood out from m back, creating a sort of hunchback, but this was only really noticeable when I slouched.","The bottom was sooooo luscious and flowy, and I was never to hot, even after dancing for a long time!"
"8.0","Have to wear a cami underneath and if you have a large chest, the ties gap open."
"8.0","Runs a little large.","I didnt get to wear it.","But a friend borrowed it for the wedding and got lots of compliments."
"8.0","The dress was flattering, a bit short for a wedding.","Colors were great!","It was definately unique and got lots of compliments.","Rented both a 10 and a 12.","Both fit but, wore the 12 because it was slightly longer.","The dress was too short for church but was fine for the reception, just a little too short to dance in."
"8.0","The dress is really heavy, so maybe not the best option if its going to be warm where youre wearing it, luckily I wore it to an outdoor wedding in January so it was perfect.","The dress runs really small,  usually Im a size 2-4.","I couldnt even get the 2 on and the 4 only zipped up after some hard work by me and my mother.","So either Ive gained a lot of weight recently or maybe order a size up in this dress.","The bodice of the dress i think actually bruised my ribs.","I was sore for a few days after wearing it.","Also, this particular dress had a wire from the bodice sticking out on the side and was going to impale me, but i got some pliers and tried to manipulate it back into the fabric.","But despite all of that I really enjoyed wearing this gown.","I felt so fancy and glamorous.","I was getting compliments all night long.","And the best part is it has POCKETS!","<3"
"8.0","I am fairly certain this sweater is meant to be worn with the zipper in the back -- not the regular way as shown on the model.","When I first put this sweater on with the zipper in front, it just felt.... weird.","Also, the designer label was in the front (although the RTR label was in the back).","So that seemed a little odd too.","I switched it around  so the zipper was in the back and it felt much better.","Curious, I googled this sweater and found many people wearing it with zipper-in-back, so Im guessing that is more standard.","That all being said -- I am usually a size small, but I ordered a size medium expecting this to be a layerable cardigan.","With zipper-in-back, this just looked really boxy when its probably meant to be more fitted.","I bet this would look cute if worn as a more fitted top.","I might try ordering it in my standard size and see if that looks better (with zipper-in-back.",":-) )"
"8.0","The fit was perfect.","I was worried it would be too small because JumpSuits tend not to fit me.","I did have to adjust the top because it was pretty loose, even with my 36D girls.","I thought it was fairly easy to take on and off, although I did need my husband to help take my arm out once.","The color is AH-MAZING.","I would definitely buy this for myself or rent again.","The only thing I didnt like was the tiny buttons on the side which didnt really hold."
"8.0","Dress is gorgeous in person, the color is very vibrant!","It definitely fits true to size and I would recommend going up a size if you want to to be a little looser on the body, as its definitely form fitting.","You will probably want to wear spanx or some form of shapewear as the front will show any creases or lines.","The back is absolutely amazing!","!"
"8.0","The fit was true to size.","The dress has slight wear to it--the zipper wasnt as stiff and bumped out and the lace had some fuzz and seeable wear - but it did not take away from the dress...especially for an evening event.","I seriously received compliments all night.","I want this dress to come in a different color so I can wear it to weddings!","lol  Its a gorgeous dress, the back is beautiful, and you will steal the show with this dress!"
"8.0","The dress has no give.","It was very snug on me, to the point I worried about hulking out of the dress.","It looked good and I dont think anyone noticed how snug the dress was at my natural waist.","The back is beautiful and I was able to wear a standard, strapless bra.","The pockets are excellent and a feature I really loved.","Overall, I would happily wear this dress again, although maybe a size 12 next time."
"8.0","Rented for a wedding.","I wanted something with a bold pattern, and this dress was perfect.","Top fit my large bust (30G) without any difficulty.","The placement of the stripes hit at the navel,  perfect for those gals with hourglass shapes.","May be an issue for gals with long torso though.","For my frame the waist was a tad loose, but not a deal breaker.","The scuba material had a lot of stretch, so the dress was very comfortable to wear to the Church and reception afterwards.","The material is thick, so no need to wear SPANX.","However it may be too thick to wear in the middle of summer.","Length was perfect as well, hit at the knee.","Paired it with black wedges, black handbag, and coral necklace."
"8.0","I am usually an 8 and this dress was exactly between an 8 and a 10 for me.","I wore the 8 for Fathers Day brunch.","It is a hip dress and the fabric is soft and flows."
"8.0","Overall this is a pretty dress, but I wish I had paid attention to the other reviewers.","This dress runs short.","I am only 55 and it was a few inches shorter than I would have liked, making me feel a little self-conscious.","If you are taller than 52, I would recommend renting the tall version.","I rented both the 4R and 6R and ended up wearing the 6R, but there was hardly any difference in sizes.","First time renting from RTR and I loved the experience!","Will be back for sure."
"8.0","The dress ran small.","It was tight in the arm pits and front chest.","I felt like it just smashed me down.","It was aslo more fitted in the front than I thought.","I was hoping for more gathers in my tummy area, a little deceiving in the photos."
"8.0","The print, fabric and cut of this dress is fabulous but unfortunately is runs very small in the chest so I couldnt zip it up.","Definitely size up if you have broad shoulders like I do!"
"8.0","Use fashion tape for shoulders!","It easily slips off.","The tight overall is pretty tight."
"8.0","I wanted to get a 2 and a 4, but the 2 was unavailable, so I just went with the 4.","It started to stretch out a little as the night continued, but its an extremely comfortable dress, and not as tight as youd expect.","The shoulders were a little ice-skaterish for me, but all in all very pretty dress and got a lot of compliments."
"8.0","Very bright, comfy dress, great for a wedding.","Only downside is the back is a bit low, so a low-back bra is needed if you dont want it to show at all.","Great to dance in!"
"8.0","Perfect for a black tie wedding.","I was 4 months pregnant and the dress gave room for my expanding waistline."
"8.0","the dress fit beautifully -- Perfect/roomy in the bust, a little big around the middle/hips, but that just made it comfortable.","It hit me right at the top of my knee.","Elegant, and fun!"
"8.0","It was so convenient to rent vs. buy for this event so I loved using the site for the first time.","I also love that they sent two sizes to try because that definitely helped.","The top was a little too big so I felt like I needed to pull it up all night but otherwise it was great."
"8.0","This dress was very pretty but I definitely should have gotten the 0 because the 2 was way too big.","It just didnt give my body any shape at all.","I also thought the material was going to be more sheer, lightweight and flowy but it was much thicker, heavier and stiffer than I had imagined.","So glad I have the unlimited membership to try out as many dresses as I want!"
"8.0","I wore this dress on my birthday and it was perfect for a fun dinner and night out with friends.","This dress is short but not obscene, I am 57 and I did not feel uncomfortable.","The sleeves are really fun and trendy and the pattern and thick material is very pretty.","The dress fits a little tight in the arms/across the top of the chest but not so much that I felt constricted."
"8.0","After reading the reviews of other similar size girls, I thought this dress would fit almost perfectly.","The only problem I really had with it was the length.","I wore 4 heels and the dress was still about 6 too long!","I tried using fabric tape to hem it up but that did not last an hour.","I ended up just holding the dress up whenever I walked somewhere which was very annoying.","Would not really recommend if you are short."
"8.0","This dress is beautiful.","The fabric is stunning, and everybody commented when I wore it.","However, there are a few things to consider when renting it.","First, the cleavage is really low.","Really really low!","It is not safe for work, unless you wear an undershirt, but in this case it looses a lot of the charm.","For a date the cleavage is a bit racy, but sexy.","The rest of the dress is so classy that one may afford showing a bit more there.","Another issue is that the dress arrived in dire need of ironing.","It wrinkles fairly easily.","It is not a problem when going out, it wont look frumpy, but it will definitely need ironing before being worn for the first time.","Now, I was nearly 6 months pregnant when I wore it.","It is not ideal, nor super comfortable, but it will be a good option for those with a bump."
"8.0","The dress fit and felt great.","Very easy to move in."
"8.0","I thought I would love this dress more than I did.","First, I would have preferred the long, but it was not available.","The dress came just to the top of my feet and I am 56.","I prefer a dress to cover my feet with shoes on.","And the materials is not as good of quality and I would have expected for this designer/price of this dress.","There was also not a lot of structure to the dress.","I am curvy and the back did not lay completely flat on my back and I had to adjust it rather frequently.","But overall, the dress was comfortable, looked good and served its purpose."
"8.0","Great for small chested women, no need to wear bra, room in the hips.","Fun, handy pockets!","Classy dress."
"8.0","I wore about 3.5 inch heels and the length was perfect for the dress, but I am on the short side.","The stiching on the sleeves were a little on the frayed side, but it wasnt very noticeable.","the rouching on the side helped create a little more curve and the slit added a bit of sexiness to an otherwise more conservative dress.","I received a lot of compliments and would love tow ear the dress again."
"8.0","It fit perfect except that Im 57 and it was a little on the short side.","(Esp.","If I were to bend) its amazing for someone who has a little bit of a belly like me after having a baby!"
"8.0","This dress was perfect to wear for my birthday dinner!","I loved the color and it was very flattering.","Like some other reviewers noted it was a little bit tight in the arm area but it didnt bother me too much."
"8.0","I think it runs true to size.","When I got a last minute invite, I was leaving town.","RTR was able to send me the dress in Vegas so that I would be ready when I got back to LA on Sunday.","That was a huge help.","I got so many compliments."
"8.0","I felt the fit was a little loose, but comfortable, a little shorter than I normally wear.","The sleeve with the lace like cape was really interesting though"
"8.0","I really loved this dress.","It has beautiful lace detailing.","However, I have a larger chest and the high necklace was MUCH higher than I thought it would be.","It choked me a bit so I couldnt wear it to the shower I had planned."
"8.0","The dress was great!","It fit perfectly and stayed up while I danced.","I definitely would recommend.","No one else had this dress and I stood out in the crowd!"
"8.0","I loved this jacket.","Its beautiful and very well made!","It is a tad warm though and I couldnt close the button but I wore it anyway.","Id rent this again in the winter in a bigger size.","Gorgeous."
"8.0","True this dress is very short, but not inappropriately.","The dress is a nice thick material, I wouldnt recommend it for a night in a club, as it would be too hot.","Im usually a size 4, sometimes Im a 6.","In this dress I wore the medium, and it was a little tight on my bust.","Overall, I would rent this dress again, and my fiance loved it."
"8.0","I liked this romper however the back gaped very oddly on me.","From the front, it looked nice.","I ended up wearing a cami underneath to somewhat even out the very large gaping."
"8.0","Cute dress, the 0 fit like it was made for me, never even tried on the 2.","The floral was pretty and perfect for an outdoor wedding.","The length was good on me, just about an 2 inches above my knee.","It was nice and lightweight too which was great in the hot weather."
"8.0","no stretch to the fabric, so it was a bit tight across my chest and ribcage"
"8.0","Wore this for a bachelorette party.","Im 58 and so the dress was pretty short.","I knew that a sequin dress would be a bit scratchy, but the inside of my upper arms were really tender at the end of the night.","The dress is very tight and low cut.","Make sure you have the right bra and shapewear and youre ready for a night out!"
"8.0","Fit great!","I ordered a 4 and 6.","They both fit great but the 4 was too short so I ended up wearing the 6.","It fit perfect and I received compliments all night.","Only downfall was that I did have to pull it down throughout the night, especially when I sat down so you wouldnt see my undies."
"8.0","This dress was a hit.","It was a bit large at the top for me.","But I don not think the 6 wouldve fit my hips that well.","I felt great in this dress."
"8.0","Im usually a 2 or 4 and the 2 was way tight.","The 4 fit well.","No need for a bra.","There is support and you cant see nips through.","Plus the 2 arrived and was really more ivory from too many cleanings.","Overall happy with the rental.","The legs do have zippers to adjust the width of the leg opening which made wearing shoes with straps easier."
"8.0","Dress felt a little larger and was very low in the chest area and the zipper was really difficult.","But after using some bar soap along the zipper, it was fine"
"8.0","The dress is really cute and the color is even nicer than in the photos.","However, it is very restrictive to arm movements.","It would be better if it were sleeveless."
"8.0","Im 510, 160 and pear shaped with 34B chest.","I wore flats since it only came in Regular length.","This dress fit and flattered like a dream.","I hosted brunch at my home and this dress was comfortable but I still felt dressed up."
"8.0","I really loved this dress, I wore it for my engagement pictures.","The fabric was thicker a had a slight texture to it.","There is more blue in the print than there looks like there is in the model picture.","The only downside to it was that I am short waisted and with the flared skirt and where it hit me it wasnt super flattering, which you can see in the photo.","I recommend this for for a longer waisted person."
"8.0","The dress had tone of sequins!","Very nice perfect for formal event!"
"8.0","Great dress!","The 2R fit well even though Ive gained some weight recently.","I needed tape to keep everything in place and to temporarily hem the dress even though I was wearing 4.5 heels.","I wish it came in a 2P!"
"8.0","My only complaint is the zipper...I had to use a pair of pliers to get it past the gathered fabric across the back.","I ordered two sizes (one as backup) and both had the same issue."
"8.0","Great dress, super sexy, but if you have a B cup or smaller the top will gape on you.","Really big and open on top.","I had to use bra inserts and fashion tape to be able to wear it in public and it still gaped in spots."
"8.0","It pulled a bit at the bust but I am a 32DD.","The pulling was more noticeable than in most sweaters.","I think it would be better on someone with smaller breasts."
"8.0","The fit was really well and the pockets were great.","I am bustier on top, but I felt the dress showed them off nicely instead of suffocating them.","The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it didnt feel like a $395 dress.","Call me picky, but overall the dress was wonderful and I got nothing but compliments all evening."
"8.0","Beautiful pattern!","I normally wear a 4, but I could have sized up to a 6 on this one.","I felt the sides were a bit tight.","I am very busty, so I could have used a little more room up to.","I am short and this dress was the perfect length."
"8.0","I received this as a replacement dress since a dress I ordered was unavailable.","Its so comfortable, while looking very pretty.","It runs a little big on top, even with my push up bra.","The pattern doesnt photograph in a flattering way, so wouldnt suggest if you are wearing it for a photo shoot for a wedding or anything like that."
"8.0","Adorable, well made and comfortable.","A bit low cut if you dont tie it up in front, but really cute."
"8.0","I usually wear a Size 6 in Express, White House etc...for some reason I keep having to move up to an 8 when I order on RTR (this could be due to designer sizing).","This dress fit great, the length was just right, and the color popped with my blue eyes.","The only negative that I can think of is the arms...they are a bit tight, if you have broad shoulders and an athletic build."
"8.0","It fit great but i didnt realize i was all lace"
"8.0","I rented this for a holiday party and loved how easy and comfortable it was to wear this.","I usually wear a size 10 but found this one a little bit roomy, which may just be due to the dress style."
"8.0","Yah, it runs really large.","Im normally a 4, sometimes 6, and was still swimming in the extra small.","If you are maybe a 6-8, the XS would probably work for you.","However, if I pulled the shoulders up so its not an off-the-shoulder, that helped a little with the oversize-ness in the bust area.","Then I belted it and that helped contain some of the fabric below.","It was actually pretty cute that way for a date night!"
"8.0","its a bit short for work but with black opaque tights it works-i liked the stretch of the fabric and it was nice and thick so it didnt show too many lumps :)"
"8.0","This dress was a non-traditional pick for me, and I got so many compliments all night long.","I decided to go with the 10R vs. 12R because I like a tighter fit with more structure.","The sheer shoulder section allowed me to wear a real bra with straps, which made me much more comfortable.","This dress does run short however, and I had to wear flats instead of heels (Im just about 56) - even then this dress was just a touch too short.","If you are looking at a 10/12 and are 55 or taller, I would definitely recommend getting the Long over the Regular length."
"8.0","Loved the dress!!","Only negative was the attached slip kept riding up!","The dress hung a little bit around the belly area but I wore spanx and it took care of that issue :)Highly recommend this dress!"
"8.0","I rented this dress for a mid-September Chicago wedding.","The b+w pattern and jacquard fabric was a good choice for our Midwestern in-between-season (the temperatures can be completely unpredictable).","I have a large bust and broad shoulders; the 10 was just a tad snug but nothing pulled and I felt like I could move freely (especially on the dance floor).","The cinched waist gave me some shape and the hemline hit PERFECTLY below my knees, making my muscular gams look shapely.","The dress could have used an iron but the floral pattern hid this well.","The dress was pretty and fun but not a knockout like some of the other dresses I’ve rented from RTR.","I paired the rental with the suggested Slate and Willow Pale Pink Floret Earrings; LOVED the earrings (they could easily be paired with a hundred other dresses/outfits)."
"8.0","There were some times that I didnt like the cut out, but still wasnt that bad."
"8.0","Runs very small.","I usually wear an 8-10, so I thought I would be safe with a 12.","I couldnt even zip it!","Luckily I live in Chicago where there is a RTR store, and I was able to exchange."
"8.0","This dress has a lot of stretch in it- which makes it easier to fit a smaller size.","I normally wear around a size 4, and I fit the size 2.","The dress is also soft and silky with a great design.","In pictures it looks great, in person it looks better!","I wore a sticky bra with it because the back is cut out."
"8.0","Great dress!","Tasteful with a fun little twist.","The material is think and high-quality and the length makes it appropriate for a classy wedding.","The only reason Im not giving it five stars is because it was a little tight in the chest area, which made me look more flat chested than usual.","Still highly recommended!"
"8.0","Im bigger busted so I opted for the medium versus the small."
"8.0","The dress was very pretty and looked pretty good, but was larger than expected, especially in the top half.","I typically wear a size 6, so I ordered a size 6 and backup size 8 since some of the reviews mentioned that the dress ran small.","Im not sure if a size 4 would have fit, but the 6 was definitely large."
"8.0","Like other reviewers, the only problems I had were the loose shoulders and a minor rash from the sequins underneath my arms.","I ordered both the 2R and 4R because I generally wear a 4.","Although the dress information says to order the size up I decided to go down instead based on some other reviews.","I ended up wearing the 2R, it worked really well and accentuated my curves.","I am curious to see whether the 0R would have maybe even fit a bit better.","I wore a strapless (very padded) push up bra which help tighten up the loose arms, if I had time to get one of the sticky push up bras I would have because that probably would have worked much better.","I am 53 and with 4 heels the length worked really well, it dragged a bit but I would prefer that to it being too short.","Overall, the dress was absolutely perfect for the occasion and I received enormous amounts of compliments.","My Rent The Runway experience went so smoothly that I cant wait to use them again!"
"8.0","The mesh sleeves add sexiness to this otherwise modest dress.","Flatters your figure.","But a bit loose at the waist for me (Im 24-inch waist, wore a size 0) and a bit long - hit middle of my knees and Im 50."
"8.0","I ordered a 12L, but they did not deliver it.","Therefore, it was a bit loose around the armholes/cleavage area; I did not find out until the day before the event, so I couldnt find the proper bra in time and felt a bit unsupported.","Perfect length for a 58 woman with 5 heels.","Great color.","Wrinkled upon delivery.","Simple yet sexy."
"8.0","I LOVED this dress.","Sadly, due to a last minute emergency I did not get to wear this dress or attend the event for which I rented it!","Luckily, RTR was nice enough to offer me a credit for my rental.","But I do still have some things to say about the dress even though I didnt get to wear it!","I ordered the 4L, since that is what I tend to wear, but noticing Ive gained a few lbs lately, I ordered the 6L as back-up.","The 4 would have been fine, but the 6 looked better due to the extra length and would have been more comfortable.","With 4 inch heels, it just skimmed the ground perfectly.","I didnt plan on wearing a bra with this, even though I was a little afraid of being flattened out even more than I am naturally by the dress!","But no need to worry- the dress provides a smooth silhouette while still keeping your shape.","A few odds and ends:1.","The dress smelled like mothballs- I realize this is probably a necessary evil due to storage.","A little perfume/Febreeze probably would have resolved this, and it wasnt so overpowering that I wouldnt have worn the dress.","2.","The mermaid hem at the bottom was wrinkly and I would have had to steam it.","(Again, I dont know how that could have been avoided by RTR).","3.","I thought the lace overlay and the lining were both dark navy upon ordering, but its actually navy lace over a black lining (it probably mentions that somewhere in the description but I didnt see it).","It didnt make any difference, and I think it actually added depth to the dress, but I wanted to mention it.","Also- this made it easier to wear black shoes or accessorize with a black clutch, for example.","I wouldnt hesitate to rent this dress again for another event!"
"8.0","Got this for work and ran big.","I will definitely re-rent this but size down."
"8.0","Very form fitting but has plenty of stretch.","I felt comfortable all night long and didnt feel the need to wear spanx.","I would definitely rent again!"
"8.0","Beautiful dark navy gown.","Not too form fitting.","Cn wear strapless bra.","Could use some sparkle around the waist.","Perfect for a black-tie affair!"
"8.0","Worn to a very formal Health System Gala.","I felt classy with an edge.","This is made from very thin jersey material that was wonderfully comfortable the entire night.","Only drawback was I wore the wrong strapless bra - make sure you dont wear a lace bra or the texture will show.","Definitely should have worn a smooth backed bra.","Thank heavens it was dimly lit, so no one noticed.","Regardless, I felt like a million bucks - its so different - a showstopper!"
"8.0","I liked the fit, feel, material, and style of this top.","It ran a little large, so I probably wont rent again.","But its a great way to change up a typical blouse for work."
"8.0","The dress fabric was amazing however it was a really large fit.","I paired it with some thigh high boots and made it work I received many compliments."
"8.0","It was gorgeous, but I wouldnt recommend it for people with a larger busy size..","It tends to pull a bit.","Besides that it was perfection."
"8.0","I wore this dress to work and loved it.","The color is a rich green/turquoise which got lots of compliments.","Its very comfortable and the fabric is pretty thick - you could wear it in cold weather with tights.","Im 55 and it hit right above my knees so it looked longer and more conservative on me compared with the RTR model photo."
"8.0","This is going to be a contradictory post...","When I first opened the dress, I was a bit bummed.","I didnt feel like the details were as noticeable in person as they were online.","Dont get me wrong, it was still a pretty dress, and it fit really well, but I was hoping a bit more wow.","However, all night long, people couldnt stop talking about the dress.","Words like amazing and beautiful were used to describe it.","People kept asking where I purchased it from, because they wanted better options for the next ball.","I let them know that RTR was a fantastic option for those of us who would attend multiple formal events each year."
"8.0","Loved the fun print on this dress (and the pockets) but I really should have returned it for another size.","the top felt like it ran very large and the straps ended up being about 1.5 inches too long on me.","I will say, its more beautiful in person.","The fabric has some sparkle, and the waist band is crystals.","I would rent again, and for sure size down on this one."
"8.0","Tight across my rib cage but I have a larger rib cage.","Lots of compliments, loved the neckline, very flattering!","Dress was in perfect condition."
"8.0","It was a little large in the chest area but everywhere else fit perfectly.","Great fit.","Not too tight but didnt look like a curtain either.","I was very happy with the fit of the dress."
"8.0","Loved this dress but it was shorter then I would have liked I wasnt able to wear heels with it, so if anyone is in the 53 range dont go for petite.","Also just an FYI it is a very heavy dress awesome for waiting in line but I got hot pretty quickly :)"
"8.0","This dress was super cute - the keyhole detail on the back is really pretty, and the lace is soft and not at all itchy.","The only downside is that the cut is not incredibly flattering for an hourglass shape, it made my waist look much bigger than it really is!","I rented it for my sisters spring daytime wedding to wear with nude flats - I didnt end up wearing it, because I had another option that I felt was more flattering, but it was a cute dress and I would consider it in a smaller size.","I typically wear an 18, and the 16W was roomy - I would almost consider getting it again in the 14W to see if a tighter fit takes care of the waist issue.","Also, RtR doesnt give the option in bust sizes but Im a 38DDD and the bust fit was fine!"
"8.0","The dress fit very well and definitely true to size.","It was a little long and I wish it came in a 4P, but I wore very high heels and ended up being ok.","Its a really classy dress, and the back is especially beautiful.","Also, the floral skirt and beaded back made it a little more fun than just a plain black dress.","I would say its a great choice for a more formal event and probably good in any season, although I wore it in the summer.","As far as a bra, I felt like all I could wear was one of the sticky bras that dont show anything in the back, otherwise straps will probably show.","I got so many compliments and loved wearing it!","!"
"8.0","I really liked this dress, but it wasnt an eye-catcher.","A lot less see-through than the picture makes it seem.","Overall it felt safe and comfortable.","It was very easy to dance in!","The fabric is definitely thicker, so I would not advise for a summer outdoor occasion."
"8.0","Dress was given to me as a backup dress and I ended liking it more that the original dress I ordered.","Fit my body type perfectly and the length was appropriate for my sons baptism.","Would rent the dress again!"
"8.0","I loved this dress but it turned out to be too dressy for the wedding I was attending.","As other reviewers have noted, the off the shoulder sleeves stay in the place perfectly.","I loved the pockets too although I probably should have gotten a 6 since I have hips and the pockets wouldnt lie flat.","Very cute.","Will rent again for a more appropriate event!"
"8.0","Its beautiful color and its a little short but it can work for work.","Perfect outfit for summer!"
"8.0","The fit was great, the color was excellent, and the lace was very pretty/intricate.","I liked the length and style, my only reason for giving this 4/5 stars is because there were loose threads/hanging strings and it smelled like it was worn (perfume?)","and not washed or dry cleaned."
"8.0","Dress fit true to size."
"8.0","The fit was pretty good but slightly tight in the arms.","On the size I wore there was also a spot where the slip peaked out further than the lace overlay and it looked a bit funky no matter what I did but no one else noticed it.","Id recommend this dress."
"8.0","This dress is very comfortable and nice - a little smaller on me than I expected (made it tight in the sleeves and at the bottom) and ultimately didnt wear because the weather was much chillier and I went with a longer dress.","It is short (as shown on the model) and would be perfect for a garden party or summer wedding!","My husband thought it was very sexy"
"8.0","I SO wanted this look to work.","I think if you have broader shoulders this sweater gives you a bulky, homeless chic looked which FreePeople can fall into sometimes.","I rocked it regardless because the print is so cool but keep in mind this makes you look 3x bigger than you are.","It is also incredibly warm - almost too warm to a point that you cant wear anything but a t-shirt underneath it.","Rent if you are going somewhere cold and use as your jacket!"
"8.0","I usually wear a 4R, but ordered the 6P and 4P in this dress because I was concerned about the length and the fact that other people seem to have a hard time zipping the dress up.","Im SO glad I went up a size for my second size.","Size 6 is usually way too large on me at the top, but this fit perfectly.","I ended up removing my strapless bra after I took this picture because it just wasnt necessary.","It was much more comfortable to go without it.","Im not sure if the 6P runs smaller in the chest than the 6R, but to me it looked and fit like a 4.","The length of the 6P was perfect with my 3.5 inch heels.","I held it a little bit when I walked but I never felt like I was going to rip it.","I got compliments all night and the dress is such a stunner in person.","Definitely rent this for your next formal wedding or event!"
"8.0","The arms were a little tight on me.","A medium would have fit a little more comfortable."
"8.0","Beautiful color, cute fit (cropped - right at the waist).","Would be cute for a date or even for every day.","I wore it w/ boots and ripped jeans for brunch, and then also wore it to work one day.","If you have more muscular arms, Id rent a size up b/c although I could have worn the Medium, like other reviewers said, I def needed the large for my arms."
"8.0","I rented this dress for a formal event after the original dress I selected fell through.","The dress was very easy to wear and super comfortable (i.e.","figure flattering without being too clingy/tight).","I was slightly uncomfortable with how deep the V neck was and considered wearing it without a bra.","However I ended up wearing a halter bra from VS and had no issues with it showing anywhere.","The two mirror pictures show the dress looked with and without a bra (I wear a 34D).","I rented the dress in a Small and Medium but elected for the Medium for the added length in the front.","I didnt have any issues with the sequins scratching my arms or the clasps coming undone.","The dress is a gorgeous navy and the sequins arent obnoxious.","I paired it with navy peep-toe pumps and gold jewelry."
"8.0","Its really abstract sort of dress.","It looks cool but isnt necessarily that flattering on me.","I think it simply might not suit my body shape (wider hips and bigger waist).","Absolutely no give in the material and runs very true to size, maybe even a bit small.","If you dont want the waistline detail to flop in a strange way rather than stand up like it does in the picture, size up, especially if you are plus size."
"8.0","The dress was pretty.","It was big around the waste so I added a belt which helped.","I could have worn a 4 or 6 but it would have been to short.","I did get lots of compliments!","Great dress for a nicer event."
"8.0","Cropped jacket, looked great over a black dress"
"8.0","It was heavy and fit very large, but we flattering.","Im 510 I usually wear a 10 and went with the 8L I also didnt wear heels because it was a little short when I added the heels.","The hanger pieces kept falling out throughout the night so tuck those in well or use tape."
"8.0","This was my first RTR experience, and I was very pleased!","The pictures and details in the reviews gave me piece of mind when placing my order.","I typically wear a size 8-10 in dresses, but the reviews advised to size down so I ordered a 6 and it fit great!","Ive already reserved my next dress!"
"8.0","The dress is beautiful and the unique neckline and bottom make it stand out.","I normally wear a 4 or 6 and after reading reviews ordered a 6 and 8.","I ended up wearing the 8 and honestly could have gone with a 10.","I have a larger butt and thighs and this dress was pretty tight in my legs and rode up my legs when I walked.","Definitely worth the rental, but order at least 1 size up, maybe 2."
"8.0","The fit was tight - I also ordered a small, and definitely needed to go with the medium.","Since its backless, the undergarment situation was a little tricky, but it turns out Victorias Secret can help with basically anything.","The long sleeves were perfect for February, and the dress is a statement in itself - no jewelry required."
"8.0","I ordered a size 6 and 8 but ended up wearing the size 6.","It was a comfortable fit for I do not like dresses that are super snug on my body.","The back (top) of the dress was slightly stretched out so I had to modify how to clasp it across the top- otherwise it would buckle.","The bottom hem seems to have fallen out in the front as well, but it was an easy fix.","The royal blue color of this dress was absolutely beautiful!","The size 8 color was faded and appeared more of a purple."
"8.0","I went for the size 10, I wanted a little more length in the dress.","I paired this with a cape, and a picnic basket for Halloween and went as Little Red Riding Hood."
"8.0","This was loose enough at the waist with enough stretch to be very comfortable for a mid-2nd trimester baby bump (without feeling like I was stretching it out or struggling with the zipper and without sizing up).","It was perfect to pair with a blazer for a client meeting, though I felt comfortable in it with the shoulders exposed at my law firm.","My only compliant is that the zipper material runs really far down the back, so it stuck out funny on my bum in a not very flattering way."
"8.0","As the reviews suggest, the dress runs a little small.","I am a size 4 but decided to go with the size 6 dress since it flowed better on me.","Works best with nude underwear and nippies.","Material wrinkles quickly but it is not noticeable from a distance."
"8.0","I received compliments about the color and fit throughout the night!","However, like everyone else says, the sleeves are a bit tight.","Mine were only tight at the bottom and the actual sleeve itself was fine.","I didnt order a 4, but I think that dress wouldve fit better but the sleeves wouldve been too tight.","I thought the 6 looked a little baggy in some pictures.","Length was a little shorter than I thought (maybe a couple 2-3 inches above my knee) but still looked classy.","When I danced the dress did lift up, so watch out if youre super tall!","I wore the Anton Heunis Budding Blue Cluster Earrings with this and the colors were great together."
"8.0","So this dress was gorgeous, however I wouldn’t suggest it for a flat chested woman.","I lacked the wow factor because the chest area looked bland.","I wore two bras for extra extra push-up.","I still got compliments though.","I wore the 4r.","My dress from David’s bridal is a comfortable 2 and this dress was a almost too tight 4r.","It was a decent length with my heels.","Flattering fit on skinny though.","Plus I wore the sleeves up instead of down because the sleeves dropped so low with my small shoulders."
"8.0","The fit of this dress was true to size.","It was really a good choice for a nice dinner with friends.","Really comfortable and easy to move in."
"8.0","I loved this dress -- the sequins cover the whole dress not just the gold bits.","I was surprised to find that the dress was not as loose as it appeared on the model -- on her, it looked more like a shift dress.","In person, the dress has quite a bit of stretch.","I ended up wearing the 4 because the 2 bunched oddly on my hips.","In the 4, though, there was a lot of extra fabric around my tummy.","Overall, I loved this dress and would rent it again!"
"8.0","This was really cute, but a little baggy so I had to really tie it tight."
"8.0","I rented this skirt for New Years Eve and ended up wearing it with a black body suit.","Got lots of compliments on it!!","Definitely agree with others though that its tight in the waist; sizing up was perfect.","My only compliant was the pleats werent as sharp as the photos and ironing didnt create the look I wanted.","Also, it wrinkles very easily so be wary if you plan on traveling with it!"
"8.0","Dress was slightly too big so I wore the 2R"
"8.0","I loved the fit with the only exception being the arms.","They definitely run small and were a bit uncomfortable throughout the night.","There was kind of a lot of cleavage but for my event that did not matter.","Other than that I absolutely loved the dress."
"8.0","I ordered a 6 and an 8, I usually wear a 6 but it was way too snug so I wore the 8.","Dress was sexy with the cut out and slit without being too much, even for a church ceremony.","Slit does ride up when you sit down, so watch out for that!","I had the dress delivered to the hotel we were at and that went perfectly.","Overall, another successful rent the runway experience!"
"8.0","I loved the color and lace on the dress.","For someone with a big chest, the deep v in the front was a bit uncomfortable and I was not able to wear a strapless bra.","Other than that I loved the dress."
"8.0","Received a TON of compliments on this dress!","When I reserved it, I thought the colors were more silver, gold and bronze; however, it has red and blue tinges to it, which made it even more appropriate for our company holiday party.","Fit well, but is definitely short so I wore it with black tights and black platform suede pumps, carrying a black clutch.","I also wore only oversized stud pearl earrings and a cocktail ring, as accessories should be understated to not compete with the dress and be too busy.","Having long hair, it continually got caught in the sequins.","Id recommend planning to wear your hair up or partially up (this dress would look super cute with a fun pony hairstyle anyway).","Beautiful dress.","You will feel like a million dollars wearing it!"
"8.0","I was wonderful!","I looked perfect!"
"8.0","Wore this dress for a Great Gastby-themed charity event.","The sparkle and semi-architectual design was perfect, and the dress itself, while a little form-fitting in the hips and booty (not that thats a bad thing!","), was overwhelmingly comfortable.","A little spanx and all was well!","Many event attendants had spent hours and $$$$$ trying to find something appropriately 20s and were flabbergasted to know Id found a perfect outfit in less than 10 minutes and for less than $50 - I think I may have converted more than one person to RTR that night!"
"8.0","I loved the length, just the right amount of leg for a wedding!","This dress has pockets!!!","My only complaint is that it was a little tight on the rib cage (I kind of have this problem with many dresses) and it poofed out, making me look a little bigger than I am.","Its not form fitting below the waist, which makes it very comfortable to move around in.","The lace is adorable and I loved the vibrant red color.","Would probably rent this one again!"
"8.0","The dress is flattering in all the right areas, although I did need to go up a size in order to see the gathered detail near the waste line.","Received loads of compliments.","The armpit area was a tad irritating by the end of the night, but nothing to put a damper on the day.","Would rent again!"
"8.0","Super fun and sweet dress!","Even though its black, I felt like the subtle polka-dot pattern made it fun enough to wear to a fall wedding.","This is also a winner for short girls -- Im 51 and it was the perfect above-the-knee length!"
"8.0","Definitely fit large - usually S in tops, but this was an XS and fit fine.","Wore it with a high-waisted pencil skirt to work.","Great because it didnt show a ton of cleavage, or slip off your shoulders as much as I thought it would.","Got lots of compliments and it was definitely very chic, but a little voluminous."
"8.0","Im petite and often run in between a 0 and 2 in most things.","I loved the look of this piece and it is very well made; however, it unfortunately just did not work very well for me in the fit.","When trying to sit or bend over it felt too small in the legs and would ride up.","The top portion was the opposite.","I usually wear around a 34B bra size, and wished that the top portion actually fit a bit snugger.","The good thing is that Im the only one that noticed any of these things and I still got tons of compliments on it!"
"8.0","This dress made me feel like Betty Draper from Mad Men!","The retro style and patchwork pattern are fun while still being professional."
"8.0","The fit was perfect and worked really well for my body type.","The detail on the back made the dress!","Overall it was just what I needed for my wedding rehearsal and the lunch after."
"8.0","This is a gorgeous dress.","The details of the black lace and metallic swirls on the skirt are beautiful.","You are able to wear a regular bra with this too, which is a great thing.","I am busty as well and it had plenty of room.","I will say, for being petite, the sleeves are a little long and the skirt is about an inch longer than Id like.","But I love this.","Very happy with this rental."
"8.0","I personally thought it was  tight across the shoulders and chest, would have sized up if I were to rent it again"
"8.0","I wore my alternate instead of this (Nicole Miller Tyrian Purple gown).","The 2R fit but was not fitted, it would have been very comfortable but did not hug my waist, hips or bum and was thereby a very conservative fit (not my aim).","The zipper isnt too tough.","The length of the 2R worked well for my 5 3 height with four or six inch heels, about an inch above the ground with the latter.","5 6 and taller would probably prefer a Long version if planning to wear heels.","The embroidery is beautiful and has multiple shades of gold/beige, and includes beading/applique along the front just about the black tulle pouf layers.","Note that the embroidered layer does extend the full length, while the lining stops at the black tule poufs.","Can be worn with a standard strapless but you need to lower the back, so probably not the best idea."
"8.0","Great fit it, it made my curves pop!","I wore it to brunch with the girls and received a ton of compliments.","The keyhole midriff was a nice peek a boo touch.","It gave me a feel for the look without showing all of my midriff."
"8.0","This dress was amazing.","I wore it to a friends formal wedding and received tons of compliments.","The silhouettes slimming and its comfortable.","I didnt wear a bra, but the material is so thick that you couldnt tell.","The size runs really small and really short.","I usually rent a 4, but I needed an 8 for this dress to drape nicely on my body without clinging.","Im a bit short at 55, but I rented the long and it barely grazed the floor with normal heels.","The sequins were glamorous, but also fairly understated.","I was pleasantly surprised they didnt scratch my arms after a night of dancing.","The look is elegant and modest.","It doesnt show cleavage, but its still sexy with a side slit and cutout back.","I really loved this dress.","Im wishing for a reason to rent it again—only next time in white."
"8.0","I received compliments ALL NIGHT on this dress- even the bride was in love with it!","The skirt is flexible and gave no issues while dancing the night away.","Im right between a size 6-8 and the 8 was a good fit, the center portion (where the lighter blue ribbon is) was a bit tight around my rib cage.","I was surprised by that, but I have a more athletic build, so its truer to size with more delicate frames!","Overall, WONDERFUL experience!","I ended up upgrading to a StylePass so that I could rent dresses for the other 4 weddings I have this year!"
"8.0","Tough to wear for big chested girls.","Otherwise very lovely"
"8.0","FIT - I tend to have a problem finding dresses that fit well.","Given that I just had a baby 6 months ago, not everything seems to be as it use to be :) That being said, I still fit into a 4, but reserved both the 4 & 6.","I am also at a height that puts me in between regular and long.","At 56, most regular sized dresses are great for length and 3 inch heel.","I had to go with the long, the regular was all rented out.","With that being said I had to wear 6 inch heels.","The dress hugged everything perfectly, and the top stayed up with no problem.","I am not well endowed so I normally get a little nervous with strapless dresses.","But this wasnt a problem.","PROS - quick turn around from the staff at RTR.","I couldnt decide if I wanted to rent or buy for this Gala.","I kept going back and forth.","I sent several e-mails to the stylist, they responded quickly and gave me all the info I needed.","I was so happy I rented!","CONS - I was silly, and didnt read the full description of the dress.","There is a TRAIN.","And if youe like me and rented the long instead of the regular and you are in between sizes.","The long is LONG.","I had 6 inch heels on and the dress still had length to it (the train part), so careful when you walk, the second size they sent me, it looked as if someone may have put a heel through the dress.","I contacted them, and they responded immediately.","And have taken care of the situation.","Even though the dress was long and had a train.","I cant really complain.","All in all great dress!","I cannot wait to rent again!","Not sure Ill ever buy another dress ;) Thank you staff at RTR, saved me some serious cash and made me look/feel beautiful!","B"
"8.0","I selected this dress for my bridal shower and ordered the LR backup size.","I was so glad I did because I ended up wearing that size instead of the Medium.","Originally from the pictures, I thought the dress material would have been a heavy cotton or linen, but came to find out it is a super stretchy material that felt body-con esq.","Really comfortable overall and a much different fit then I would have ever gone with!"
"8.0","This quilted dress is stretchy and oh so comfy while maintaining a classic look.","However, I am only 54 and I spent the day tugging at it because it was just too short for work.","Rent with caution if you have long legs or work somewhere conservative like I do."
"8.0","I got so many compliments on this dress!","At first, I was on the fence about the dress.","It ran a little large in the waste for me but I loved the shape of the dress and the plunging neckline!","If youre not into cleavage I would suggest a different dress!","But I was comfortable all night which was awesome!","This dress was great for a cocktail/semi formal event and can be dressed up or down with accessories."
"8.0","I coupled the dress with a fur throw and red loubs.","Lots of compliments.","I will say have a 32DD bust - it was a little tight in the chest and bunched a bit on my back - had to have those photos edited by our photographer.","All in all, the cut was classy and bold.","I was into it!"
"8.0","Pros: light weight material- good for a hot summer day Pretty colors and fun open backOther details:It was short on me and Im only 53The size 4 fit perfectly.","Im 36-26-36"
"8.0","It was a little tight through the bust, but overall, worked well.","I would have preferred the long version, but it wasnt available.","It wasnt short, but didnt feel as long as Id like.","Works great with gold jewelry."
"8.0","It fit well except for the zipper being a little off.","I will definitely be renting again."
"8.0","At 52 and roughly 110 lbs, this was a perfect option for me.","I didnt have to worry about the length, which is always a problem for me."
"8.0","Fun, but short and way too see through even for night.","Not very well made as a dress"
"8.0","I wasnt particularly fond of this dress at first, being large chested with a small waist anything that drapes (rather than cinched at the waist) makes me feel like im  wearing a tent already, but i did love  the sequins and the people i went out with were going nuts  over it - the birthday girl even wanted to trade dresses with me.","I got several more compliments in this than with any other dress Ive worn.","I  even had multiple strangers stop me and ask me where i got it.","It photographs really well because of its sequins, and i have to say i felt pretty awesome in it.","Dress definitely ran a size large - i have never been a size 4 in my life, but the night i wore this dress i was!","One size  down from my usual fit well, but was pretty snug in the shoulders, I  wasnt able to raise my arms all the way up.","Overall though,  great  dress, and the sequins dont even itch!"
"8.0","As all people have reviewed, you absolutely cannot wear a full coverage bra with this.","The arm holes are cut really low, which as a result brings out your boob fat (if youre large chested like myself).","I was able to wear a strapless bra comfortably, but was self conscious about the skin between my arms and chest and tried to place my hair over it the whole time.","Other than that, it was really comfortable with SCUBA suit material and easy to dance in.","Tried on both the 8 and the 10 I received, both were stretchy and fit fine.","Its probably a safe bet dress."
"8.0","the fit is true to size maybe a little on the larger side.","I rented the 6 and 8 and went with the 6 and still had some room to dance all night long."
"8.0","I ended up only trying on the outfit and not going out in it.","The length is perfect, the fabric is light-weight, the colors are great.","It was just a bit too snug around my stomach and hips.","Granted, I have bigger hips, but I just felt self conscious in the fabric pulling.","I think the large might have been TOO big and drapey in the top, so it was just my body shape that didnt work in this particular romper."
"8.0","im typically a 4 and the 42 fit well, except was a little tight on top.","if youre more chesty than me, size up.","the rest the dress fit well with some room.","my issue was with the length.","im rather short at 53 so instead of hitting around the knee it was mid calf, otherwise looks fine.","really cool cut.","would def recommend to someone taller.","color was a red/orange than a true red, which was still a lovely color."
"8.0","The 4L was long enough that I could wear 3 heels and it was just off the ground.","My fellow tall ladies - be aware that the under slip is very short, and rides up quite a bit you sit down.","If you are going to be sitting a lot with your lap exposed, consider a different dress.","Other than the short under slip, I loved the dress and got so many compliments.","Very comfortable.","I wore a stick on bra and was very comfortable."
"8.0","I rented this for a girls night.","The 0 looked amazing but was a bit tight, but the 2 was too big so I wore the 0.","It was adorable for sure.","I was worried it would be too long but it was the perfect length (I am 55).","The skirt was so fun and I didnt want to stop wearing it!","The arm holes were a bit small for sure."
"8.0","Wore it to a NYE party.","Stunning back detailing and striking shape.","The only issue were the connectors for the halter -- they continued to unsnap throughout the evening until I just had to tie the strings together.","It was covered by my hair so it wasnt noticeable.","Even when the snaps were working, the dress would drop pretty far down.","For an A-cupper, this wasnt particularly flattering, so the string-tying technique helped move the dress up a bit as well."
"8.0","This gown flows beautifully for amazing red carpet drama.","The fitted bodice gives great waist and chest definition, while the forgiving skirt flatters us ladies with curves.","I wore this dress for the Napa Valley Film Festival Gala and the compliments were rolling in all night long (even from the A-Listers).","The only thing I can say is the zipper is very difficult to zip up.","I tried the size up just in case that was the issue, but it too had the same problem (barely able to get it to zip, I thought we were going to break the zipper) yet the dress was way too lose and would not stay up.","So, the 10 it was and we just had to pray the zipper would go up (and then back down later hahaha).","This is the only reason the gown did not get 5 stars, for an $850 gown I just kind of expected better quality when it came to the zipper."
"8.0","This is an easy, bright, and fun dress everyday dress.","I loved the colors, length (petite here!)","and the way the belt had no loops for it.","It does run big and you have to wear it right so it doesnt gather.","It seems pretty versatile - good for the beach, a BBQ, party - etc.","It works nicely off shoulders but you can wear it higher too - which I found myself doing.","A few cons are: it seems to run big, and the belt is a bit flimsy (rolls) - still I did love wearing it and I did get compliments.","I honestly would have bought it; but it looked a little dull."
"8.0","WAY too small.","I ordered up to a 2, Im normally a 0 or 2 and even the 2 had a  SUPER SMALL waist, like I could not wear them.","Disappointed."
"8.0","I loved this dress.","It was such a flattering cut.","Im a curvy 6 and the fabric was such a high quality, but have very little give.","I had ordered this and another back up and went with the other dress.","I would rent this again in the future.","I was sad to not have anywhere to wear it to."
"8.0","The elastic on the top felt a little flimsy.","Never had problems staying up, but looked strange to me.","Super comfortable material though, and though thick, still felt great outside in August."
"8.0","This dress leaves very little to the imagination!","Im usually a 2, sometimes a 4, sometimes a 0, and could have worn either the 2 or the 4 but I found that with the 4 the dress rode up a little bit, while it stayed snug in the 2.","The color is beautiful, somehow understated but still stands out.","The color is definitely a little darker than it looks in the photo.","I didnt have to wear a bra with it at all because Im pretty flat-chested, and loved that aspect of the dress.","I actually found that it looked weirder with the strapless bra underneath because you could see the lines of the bra - like I said, it leaves little to the imagination.","Overall, I loved it - my one complaint, though, is that its very constricting.","Like SUPER tight.","I found that with a 3:30 ceremony, 6:00 cocktails until 11pm and activities in between, I was a little constricted.","But worth it!","I felt great in this dress!"
"8.0","I am between a size 10 and 12.","The 10 was too tight and the 12 was a little big, but I was comfortable.","Im big up top, so that was my biggest concern.","I am 55 and weigh 175.","The color is very matted, but I received lots of compliments."
"8.0","Off the shoulder dress is just what I wanted for a fun look and this dress delivered!","Running a bit small, we recommend going one size up for backup.","With room in the bust this dress is great for all cup sizes.","The midsection is fitted to show off your curves, but it is still comfortable.","If you’re curvier, you may want to consider sizing up due to the fitted hip area.","One thing that I love about this dress is the off the shoulder feature; however that means you would have to wear a NuBra or strapless bra for this look.","The long sleeve and off the shoulder feature make this dress super flattering.","This dress is perfect for weddings and holidays.","It would look best with black heels and accessories."
"8.0","The dress fit AMAZING, hit and hugged me in ALL the right places.","The dress was heavier than expected (in a good way) the lining kept the sequences from being itchy on my skin.","Because of the low back I went bra-less and the lining kept me from showing hard nipples etc.","The only downfall of the dress is my inner arms rubbed on the sequences every time I moved them which left me with raw/red inner arms."
"8.0","I got this for work and loved how it felt like an oversized sweater.","It fit fine but for me it was neither here or there, it was just a dress.","Its pretty low cut so i had to use safety pins as it was not appropriate for work."
"8.0","I rented the dress to wear for my engagement photos and loved it!","It looked gorgeous in the photos.","The fit was a little weird- I would say that the top of the 6 I rented fit perfectly, but the bottom just seemed obscenely short, so I chose to wear the 8, even though it was a little big in the top.","The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the material was really itchy under the arms if you are planning for wearing this for a long period of time.","I even wore it with a cardigan for part of the day and it still didnt quite fix the issue.","I got tons of compliments though and loved the dress.","its a stunner!"
"8.0","Many of the reviews mentioned it being short, but I didnt find it short at all.","In fact, I wish I ordered it in my usual size.","As others mentioned the zipper falls down an inch or so but wont go farther than that.","True to size and comfortable .","Overall great experience"
"8.0","Im a pear and I wear a 16W.","Since the reviews mentioned that the dress runs small, I ordered an 18 as a back up size.","The 18 was very loose around the neckline.","I needed a fashion tape to make it wearable.","Luckily I fit the 16.","It was a little snug around the hip area but after I squeezed into my shapewear it fitted me well.","It did not look tacky and hugged my figure very well.","I completed the look with gold jewelry renting Star Light Star Bright necklace and matching bracelet by Nicole Miller.","My aunts and cousins could not believe my transformation.","They said I looked very elegant.","I knocked off one star because the neckline would not stay flat on my neck area.","It would roll down.","Im not sure if this is because of overuse.","It also arrived on time.","I had it sent to our beach house in Hawaii where the wedding was to take place.","And it arrived on the day I had requested.","I am pleased with the RTR and will definitely rent again."
"8.0","I thought the blouse ran a little big.","I had on the X-small and could definitely try an XX-Small if they had one.","It still is very lovely and looks great.","I wore it to work then a work event later."
"8.0","Fits true to size - looks great on"
"8.0","So I (mostly) loved this dress.","My usual size fit, which given its not a-line was something I was worried about.","I rented it for New Years Eve dinner and it was so fun.","So many compliments, as with all RTR rentals.","BUT Id add two notes of caution: my inner arms were super chaffed from the sequins.","I knew thatd happen the minute I tried the dress on, and if I were buying it in the store I wouldnt have bought the dress.","Second, if you have a short torso and a pear shape like me, this dress wont fit right on top.","The smallest part of the dress stopped high enough up on me that the back sagged in a slightly awkward way.","I guess if you had big boobs to push out the fabric it might work?","Top-line, loved the dress!","Wouldnt rent it again."
"8.0","Interesting (in a good way) silky feeling fabric.","Fun dress to throw on and nice and loose in the heat though it gets wet easily.","Tie the front tight and you will need to adjust and check in on it if wearing a bra.","Started to loosen slightly throughout the day.","Has a bit of a sheen to it.","A little low cut for my taste but still cute and several people commented on it."
"8.0","lightweight and well made"
"8.0","Easy.","Flattering.","Enough to stretch to fit many body types.","Would be a great choice for early pregnancy and after baby."
"8.0","After reading the reviews, I went with this dress for a wedding on a cool spring evening, and I am glad I did!","I paired it with black tights and emerald green statement earrings.","The lace neckline is beautiful.","The bust line has very little give, so if you are larger chested, definitely size up as a backup.","Same with the skirt, it runs very fitted through the hips, so size up if youre a pear-shape like me!","Overall, great dress, would recommend to anyone."
"8.0","1.","True to size, but a little loose around the waist.","2.","Im 57 (171cm) and its a little bit short for me (Im wearing flats), but its not a big deal 3.","Loved the material & color!"
"8.0","FAB dress- very flattering!"
"8.0","I really enjoyed wearing this jumpsuit out to a fancy dinner, and it was actually long enough for me and roomy enough for my chest.","I probably wont rent it again because I dont think this is the most flattering style for a true hourglass shape, but I definitely had fun with it for a night."
"8.0","As other review mentioned, the dress runs long.","I ordered a 0L and at 58 with 2-3 inch heels, I still needed to pin it up a bit.","It was still easy to walk in even with the length.","The print really stood out among the other solid dresses at the event, while still appropriate for the dress code!"
"8.0","I loved this dress.","It gave me a great waist and the material has a little stretch so it is forgiving.","The material is a little heavy but for a chilly Chicago event it was perfect."
"8.0","I rented this dress for a speakeasy themed work party, and while it was cute, it was a little shorter in the back than I prefer, so if youve got a booty, keep in mind that itll be shorter in the back than in the front.","My backup size was a size up, but it was too loose on the top and my bra wouldve shown.","I thought it rubbed a bit under the arms also.","Overall, this dress worked well for my event."
"8.0","I am 54 and about 180 lbs, wore the 14WR.","Fit was comfortable, loved the pockets and swing of the skirt.","Found it flattering for my curvy/hourglass figure.","The only issue for me is that it is VERY low cut and I felt like my cleavage was way too much.","I got fashion tape but that wasnt really the problem - there just isnt a lot of room for a large chest so it ends up spilling out.","Luckily I had a shawl to provide a little coverage, but wouldnt rent again for this reason.","I know the low neckline was clearly illustrated in the RTR photos and user photos, so my fault for taking a chance!"
"8.0","This dress is gorgeous.","Very simple and classy, however, you absolutely cannot wear a bra.","I am very small chested so this was a bit of an issue.","I used fashion tape which was fine when I was standing but found that I could not slouch at all while I was sitting during the ceremony or dinner.","Otherwise it was perfect for the occasion."
"8.0","This dress fit perfectly and looked very sophisticated."
"8.0","This dress stands out.","While the fabric is a bit your-grandmothers-curtain-esque -- if youre Ok with heavy fabric then this dress is great for you.","I loved the cut of the sleeves.","It highlights defined shoulders.","The cross-open back is really flattering and shows a wedding-appropriate amount of skin.","The asymmetrical hemline is really nice.","Im 57 and the front hit me below my knees, almost tea length.","It was very fun to twirl in this dress.","Because of the A-line I didnt have to wear Spanx and could go braless (Im a 36-B)."
"8.0","The color is absolutely amazing, the lace is delicate and classic and the overall fit of the dress is great.","Everyone commented on how gorgeous the dress was!","It was all great except for one thing : the arms.","As has been stated by a few other people, the sleeves are SO tight.","I couldnt really lift my arms up as high as I would like and at times it was very uncomfortable.","But, it was so pretty I rationalized the discomfort.","Only rent this dress if you have very lean arms."
"8.0","I wore this dress on vacation out to dinner on the water.","It was perfect for the beachy town.","I could also see wearing this to a bridal shower.","I wore the 0 and it fit around the waist and hips, but the chest was so large (and I have big boobs for my frame).","I had to tape down the bust area, but it worked out great!"
"8.0","Wore this dress 2 months pregnant and it still looked great.","Received tons of compliments, perfect for a formal dinner event."
"8.0","Runs very long for an XS - Im 52 and even with 4 heels it pooled on the ground.","I made it work but wish that XS would be a little shorter.","The true wrap style was very flattering."
"8.0","I liked this dress, i usually wear size 6, and i ordered size 6, but it was little tied on my bust area.","After reading the review i ordered a back up size 4, but should go with one size up.","Im 130 lb, 51 and my bust is 36B."
"8.0","Gorgeous fabric, well constructed, comfortable!","The length was just skimming the floor.","I sized up to compensate for being 22 weeks pregnant.","Top was a little larger as a result and the low cut was a little threatening.","The zipper was stiff to get closed, also due to the fit of my baby belly.","I was definitely pleased how comfortable I was for the day, danced with ease, and got compliments!","I thought the rental process was great and appreciated the extra back up size."
"8.0","I bought this as a casual dress to wear on vacation.","It fit the bill and was super comfortable.","I loved the print and colors.","Since it is so flowy I think it would work great on pregnant women too."
"8.0","This dress was true to size, although I could see how it would be tight in the bust for anyone with a larger chest size.","The colors are bright and vibrant; and I love a dress with pockets!","It is a lightweight fabric which was nice to wear on a Texas summer night!"
"8.0","The dress is really lovely, with lace and sequins.","In the daylight, at home, the dress seemed like almost too much, but once we arrived at the formal event, I felt very elegant and appropriately attired.","There is not a lot of give - I usually wear a 6, but the 8 was much more comfortable for me in this gown.","The fitted style and light color mean that every lump and bump will show - I recommend wearing spanx for a seamless look.","It was comfortable for sitting down and most importantly, it was long enough for me to wear 2 1/2 heels and still have the dress skim the floor.","Overall a great dress."
"8.0","This is a beautiful dress.","I wore 3 inch wedges, and it was still a bit long.","I also had to pin the bust in order to keep my bra from showing.","Overall, I was pleased with this selection."
"8.0","I wore this dress for my engagement party and it was a hit!!!","Only issue I had was with the zipper.","It seemed tough to zip at a certain spot (maybe the fabric, or me?","who knows) The fit was very comfortable and I did to feel constricted at all.","I did order a back-up size and that fit without any zipper issues, but was a bit bigger in the chest area for me.","Im 52 with a curvier lower half.","The dress was a bit higher in the back because of my curves, but that was fine.","I also wore this dress for my engagement photos the next day and it made our pictures that much better."
"8.0","Beautiful dress but didnt work out since I am pear shaped (big butt and avg sized bosoms).","Size 10-12 fit well around the hips but top was too big to look right for the event.","Would 100% recommend for hour glass ladies!"
"8.0","Nice print and fit.","My only complain is that the dress I received had a lot of pilling."
"8.0","I wore this jumpsuit to a fiesta party and it was a hit!","I normally wear a 10/12 and the large fit like a glove.","I liked how the jumpsuit hugged my curves without creeping up in the crotch area (if you know what I mean).","I wore flats, and the plant length was just fine (Im 56 tall).","It probably would have worked with small heels too.","My only minor complaint is the bust area was a little too roomy.","I could have used a couple of chicken cutlets to fill things out a bit.","Also, the little coat hanger loops kept slipping out all night.","I would have cut them off if it wasnt a rental.","But overall, very fun, festive outfit that I would highly recommend!","Side note: This outfit looks oddly similar to the red dress cha cha lady emoji - unexpected perk!"
"8.0","I thought this was a big baggy in the bust (Im a 32C and wore a size small) but otherwise I loved it.","The nude and black coloring looks great in person."
"8.0","This was my back up dress for the evening for the North American International Auto Show charity preview ball.","It fit perfectly (I am 510 & usually a 4-6).","I would definitely wear it to something like a wedding.","Someone else had cautioned that it was a popular dress so to beware of others wearing it at an event and I did see someone there in it.","Other than that I highly recommend."
"8.0","I loved that this dress highlighted my hourglass figure with the tailoring at the waist.","The color was a beautiful coral that  really stood out at the August wedding I attended.","It fit really well while standing,but was a bit uncomfortable when sitting down because it was quite tight through the hips"
"8.0","Loved the material of this dress.","It was so light weight and perfect for a humid summer day.","I wore size 0 and it was very comfortable for office wear and did not cling to any specific areas.","The colors arent as vibrant as pictured but still a great floral print."
"8.0","This was a great work dress.","I received several compliments.","Dress did run large I suggest going down a size."
"8.0","The color of this gown was amazing: a deep, rich raspberry.","Fit for this dress was true to size.","I could have worn the 2R but felt the 4R gave me a better fit in the waist area (allowing me to still eat dinner and be comfortable).","I did make use of fashion tape to keep the girls in check as well as adhesive bra cups.","Otherwise, nothing special is required for undergarments.","Length for me was right to the floor when wearing my 3 platform heels."
"8.0","An Italian 46 is a US 10 and Im a US 8 so I really should have sized down (and will the next time I rent this one) but holy smokes, it took serious effort to get the sleeves up over my upper arms!","Length was a little longer than I anticipated and this dress would be more flattering if it was about an inch shorter (Im 57) so you tall ladies looking for a below-the-knee option will be in luck here.","Overall this is a comfortable, work appropriate stunner that I will be renting again (but next time Ill size down and pray that the sleeves arent any smaller)."
"8.0","Rented for work, but also looked adorable on vacation.","Wore with wool tights and boots, and added a scarf.","Would rent again!"
"8.0","This dress has a great design and the back is very flattering in all the right places.","The shoulders do seem to slip down occasionally and I did tape the hanger straps to ensure they did not show.","The waist was a little big so I used a large black belt to hold it in a place a little better.","Great dress for cocktail parties and birthdays."
"8.0","The dress fit well, however it was longer than I would have liked given my petite stature.","It fell just below my knees, and for this reason looked more conservative than I would have liked.","I would recommend this dress for girls who are taller, but if you dont mind a more conservative look (for you petite ladies), this dress is lovely!"
"8.0","It was a little tight in the shoulder section, but fit great everywhere else.","I did have to use fabric tape on the buttons in the bust section due to the space in-between gaping open.","Loved the length and material of the dress.","I got several compliments."
"8.0","The sheath underneath was super comfortable and the sparkle on the overlay was just perfect.","Struck a nice balance for an evening charity event.","It is forgiving but fitted nicely."
"8.0","This dress was perfect for a formal event.","I wore the 4 long with 3 inch heels and it was perfect.","This is the perfect black dress for a formal event."
"8.0","I ended up not wearing this because it was too large in the bust (Im on the small side).","It fit well everywhere else!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to an Eyes Wide Shut-themed New Years Eve party.","I loved this dress!","If it had been the correct length, I would have given it 5 stars.","I read the reviews from other RTRers who were my height and they seemed to do fine with the Regular length, however I would have been better off with the Petite length.","I had to wear 4 platform heels and I still had to pick up the dress a bit to walk.","The boning and fit through the hips was very flattering on my figure.","Id recommend this dress for anyone whos looking for a special gown that will make them feel like a million bucks (and stand out in a sea of black)."
"8.0","It runs a tad big around the top and I found I kept pulling  to keep it up but otherwise perfect fit.","I am 55 and wore 3 inch heels-the regular length was the perfect length."
"8.0","I chose this for an early evening outdoor wedding in the Texas Hill country.","The free flowing fabric was cool enough for the late afternoon sun and design provided enough coverage for the cool evening, all while accommodating my growing fifteen week baby bump.","I was both comfortable and feeling beautiful and confident (not always an easy feat when one is expecting) and I received tons of compliments.","The dress runs a little large; I chose a medium bc thats generally my pre-pregnancy size but could have easily worn a small.","Also, the pleats were not as prominent as the website photo suggests.","Overall, I was very happy with my rental."
"8.0","I loved this dress.","But beware...get the long if you are 55 or taller.","Trust me.","Youll be pulling it down all night.","I love to wear heels and I ended up going with a 1.5 inch heel because the regular is very short."
"8.0","This was a beautiful color and great dress.","I got a lot of compliments.","It is form fitting, I was able to wear tights because it was cold out but if I was going bare legged I would have needed some spanx.","I wish I got a picture that night, but I would recommend this dress!"
"8.0","Definitely size up, Im a reliable 10/12 and ordered a 12/14 for this event based on reviews.","That said, dress was comfortable and looked great.","If you have a big bust, I do suggest a strapless bra as it doesnt lock and load like some other dresses, but make sure the bra cups dont come up too high and my first attempt bra was visible above the red fabric neckline.","The 12 came with a petticoat, but it was absent from the 14."
"8.0","I picked the small with the medium for backup.","The small fit pretty well but was a little shorter in the torso than I was comfortable with so I wore the medium.","It was just a little roomier and more comfortable to be eating and dancing all night!","I received a ton of compliments and would absolutely rent this again!"
"8.0","I was super happy with this dress.","It was classy and chic and I got many compliments.","If youre on the taller side, I would recommend choosing the longer option; the only downside was the 8R was a bit shorter than I wouldve liked, but I made it work.","Great dress!"
"8.0","This dress is amazing.","I loved color.","It was perfect for a ranch wedding in Texas.","The only thing I would warn about is bigger chested ladies.","It is very tight on top.","I could not even fit a bra under this dress.","The 4 fit perfectly everywhere but the chest.","Unfortunately, the 6 was still tight up top and a little loose on the bottom.","But so many people complimented this dress.","Even people I have met before didnt recognize me!"
"8.0","Wore this for my outdoor summer graduation.","I was going to be wearing some heavy robes on top of my dress and so I was looking for a lightweight dress that wouldnt show any sweat marks once I took off the robes for pictures and then brunch later on.","This dress was the perfect weight and style for my outdoor summer event.","I loved the vibrant colors of the flowers.","The fabric is lightweight and laid really well on my body without showing any flaws.","The length overall was a bit shorter than I would have liked, but the asymmetrical hem helped a bit.","I would recommend to others to rent, but probably wouldnt rent again because of the short length."
"8.0","The dress is really pretty and feels expensive but it was so hard to zip up.","I think mainly because its tight and so you need to put it on completely and then zip it up from the back with your hands.","Hard to do, especially as you get closer to your neck.","Also, the back is transparent so you either need to go braless or wear the sticky bra.","I wore a sticky bra, but didnt love how it looked with the dress.","Overall really nice dress though!"
"8.0","My original dress selection and backup were both damaged and unwearable.","With 25 minutes left to order a new dress for my sons Montessori fundraising event, the stylist picked a few dresses to wear to the black and white, elegant/casual event.","This dress wasnt too short on my 54 frame.","It was comfortable, pretty, unique and received compliments and looks all night long.","It is a shift so dont expect it to be fitted.","My original selection was more fitted so wearing this seemed a bit loose/gaped around the abdomen and lower back.","With a 32D/34C chest, wearing a strapless bra didnt seem too tight but I could imagine if I was a larger bust, it would be a bit snug."
"8.0","Gorgeous dress, lovely texture, got lots of compliments and it has pockets!!!","I usually wear a size 8 and it was pretty true to size in the waist.","I also got a size 10 but did not bother trying it on.","The bust was a bit loose for me but I chose to wear pasties instead of a bra.","Length was good for me, although I imagine it would be pretty short for a super tall person.","The zipper is a pain to zip over the seam so be aware of that but once its on, its beautiful!"
"8.0","As a second rental, I was really excited to see what this dress would bring me.","I ordered a 2R and 2P as I was worried about length.","The size was spot on, however the length is pretty long for girls on the shorter side.","I wore the 2P with 4 in heels and it barely touch the floor.","It was a beautiful dress and I received many compliments on it.","My only complaint is any time I walked up stairs or down I would have to pick up the dress and because it has many layers to it I would have to make sure I had the entire dress held up before walking to prevent myself (or my boyfriend) from stepping on it.","I ordered this dress because I plan to wear it to a wedding.","Im on the fence right now on ordering it again due to length issues only."
"8.0","Im usually a size 6-8, but the size 4 definitely looked better on me, so as other reviews encouraged me to do, be sure to get a size smaller than normal.","I liked the style over all - The slouchy top is off set by the short length keeping it cute and sexy but modest at the same time.","I wasnt in love with the material - it just seemed kind of cheap.","But the overall look was cute."
"8.0","I wore this dress to my dental school gala and received compliments all night long!!","I ordered the size S and XS and ended up wearing the XS because the S bunched fabric around the butt/thighs.","Removable straps come with the dress, which ended up being more of a pain because the little tags tended to pop up all night (I ended up taping them down with fashion tape).","Overall, it was a beautiful dress that I would definitely wear again!!","!"
"8.0","There were a few snags in both dresses.","I usually wear a 2 but the 4 for a little better.","I didnt wear a bra, and it worked just fine."
"8.0","I received many compliments on this dress, frequently asked Where did you get that dress?!","I am usually a dress size 4, but the 4 was very tight.","The 6 was much more comfortable and forgiving.","The dress was very pretty, however I am an hourglass figure and it accentuated my hips much more than I expected.","There are slimline pockets in the dress at the hips, but their bulk however slight, adds to the fullness at the hip.","I felt that I looked heavy and was disappointed with how frumpy I felt while wearing the dress.","I would recommend this dress for someone who is thin with more of a straight figure, where the dress would create more curves.","On a curvier woman, this dress is much more difficult to pull off."
"8.0","I got this for work but didnt end up wearing it because it was too tight.","It was comfortable and Id consider getting it again for a dinner date or cocktail party."
"8.0","The 6 fit perfect, but so much shorter then the 8.","Definitely size up one or two sizes.","Lots of compliments on the back.","Also super comfortable like other reviews have said...feels like wearing pajamas!","Would have given it a 5 but there was some pilling."
"8.0","Fits well, goes casual to nice dinner"
"8.0","I booked the 4 and selected a 6 as a back-up.","Sadly, the 4 I had booked was returned in bad shape and they would only be able to send the 6.","They did however send two more Bagdley Mischkas with similar cuts in size 4.","As I expected, the 4 fit perfectly!!","The 6 was very comfortable up top, but it was noticeably baggy around my waist and butt (which is incredible, my big butt is normally the problem).","Ill be wearing the other Bagdley Mischka dress, but Im happy that the cut and fitting worked out the same."
"8.0","I really liked the elastic on the sleeves and how it was longer in the back.","I wish I would have ordered the size down as it was a little too big which made it low cut."
"8.0","This dress was perfect for sparkle/glitter theme bachelorette party for my best friend!","The dress was beautiful in person so many compliments!","Runs large I normally wear a med and wore the small !"
"8.0","Loved this.","Got many complements.","Hate I have to return it.","Got the 6 and 8.","6 fit fine, but I preferred the 8 for the extra length and how it fit in the stride.","Very comfortable.","Great for moving and dancing and perfect if you like to eat and not feel like you cant breathe in what youre wearing.","So glad I found this."
"8.0","The dress fits great, it is a little longer then on the leggy model (shocking!).","It looks like it would have been scratchy under the arms but it really isnt at all.","I was able to wear a criss cross bra, just made sure the straps didnt pop out the front as it cuts in a little bit from your armpits up to the shoulders.","Really fun dress!"
"8.0","I loved this dress for an everyday, around town dress."
"8.0","The dress was easy to wear-the flowy bottom half meant that I didnt have to worry about sucking in or wearing spanx!","It looked great and was fun to dance in.","Others had mentioned the length being an issue so I am glad that I went for Petite-if you are on the fence-go petite!"
"8.0","Didnt wear the dress.","Too big in the bust for me.","Absolutely beautiful in person."
"8.0","Fit is true to size.","The only downfall is that the sleeves are not lined, which I thought would be itchy, but to my surprise not at all!","I received so many compliments in this dress and really felt fabulous.","I would recommend and totally rent again.","Loved it."
"8.0","I am a very consistent size 6.","This dress fit, but was a tiny bit on the large side.","I would have liked it to be a bit more snug, especially as a strapless dress.","But before I went out, I jumped up and down in it and everything stayed in place, so it worked out great!","The pockets were my favorite part.","They made a very traditional-feeling dress more modern.","The fabric was rich and beautiful, and the dress was very well made.","I wore a contemporary necklace with it to balance out the more formal, feminine feel to the dress."
"8.0","Stunning dress, however, the top kept folding forward and the zipper didnt stay centered.","So, had to readjust a couple of times throughout the night."
"8.0","This dress was completely fine, it fit well and very true to size but just a little underwhelming.","Loved a lot of my rent the runway dresses a lot more but it was a nice dress for an occasion where youre not necessarily looking to stand out"
"8.0","i thought it was a cute top, the color is very vibrant.","ran a tad large so I was able to wear the 8 instead of a 10.  loved it."
"8.0","I rented this for a Bridal Shower, and it was perfect, EXCEPT for the length.","Im 54 and wore my highest heels and was still tripping over it.","The rest of the dress was great, it was lightweight, fun and flowy.","Just wayyy toooo long."
"8.0","I did have zipper issues.","My husband couldnt get the zipper up so half of the night, my back was out.","It looked like I just had a low cut back.","Also, the previous wearer had put some type of knot to keep from showing too much cleavage and I couldnt undo it.","I wanted to have the whole cleavage look but instead I had that stupid knot.","Overall the dress was great and the service was good.","I am 62 and all leg, so the dress didnt touch the floor."
"8.0","The color is just unbeatable.","I received several compliments on this dress both for the color and the unusual shape.","Sadly, even though Im only a 36B, the top is strangely tight.","My shoulders were restricted all night and I wished I had gotten the 10 to size up to.","Also, as others stated, the hook in the chest area is way too high and makes so sense.","I used a pin and it was fine, but smushed my boobs to keep the top closed.","I wouldnt rent this dress again, but if youre super flat, youll love it."
"8.0","the ties in the back were tough to manage and they were all tangled in knots when I opened the dress, luckily I was able to fix them to still wear it.","I am 58 and the dress hit the floor but overall the fit was very comfortable.","I wore it to an outdoor party in the evening."
"8.0","Beyond obsessed with this dress!!","I am normally a size 4 and I ordered both 4 and 6.","The 4 fit, but the coloring was a bit off so I went with the 6 (not a huge difference).","Warning: this dress is SHORT!!","But if you throw on a pair of tights and are confident with how it fits, then it isnt a problem.","Every single person I saw gave me a compliment on my dress and asked where I bought it.","I felt so sexy and fun in this dress, it made me feel super special at my birthday party.","The dress looked great in this photo.","Cant wait to RTR again soon!","!"
"8.0","Beautiful dress; the details on the bodice are shimmery (not glittery) and interesting.","Runs a little large in the chest/shoulders."
"8.0","Cute dress that did the trick.","Nothing out of the ordinary, and I have had a few dresses that were out of this world 5 stars."
"8.0","Cute dress, wore with black sandals and a gold bangle.","Im a little survey so it felt a bit snug around the hip area."
"8.0","I got an eight but probably could have ordered a 6 for a snugged fit.","Still it was very comfortable and stylish."
"8.0","It fit very comfortably.","I wore it to dinner and a masquerade ball for NYE.","I was able to eat, drink, sit, stand, dance and never had to worry about it.","The sparkles made it really fun, however with the black color its not a total showstopper.","I liked that it sparkles b/c of the beads rather than being sequin.","Its a different style that I have ever worn, and it was fun to try something new.","With the baggier top and sleeves, and I maybe could have gone a size down, but I was worried about my hips being too wide.","The only reason I didnt give it 5 starts is i felt like the sleeves werent super flattering.","It is heavy, but I thought that was good for a winter event."
"8.0","It definitely does NOT run large like some of the other reviews say.","I am 57,  135lbs and 34C....","I wore the 4 but it was tight- especially around my boobs!!!","Its a beautiful, classy dress though.","Loved it!"
"8.0","Vivid color, beautiful lace work, generous fitting.","This would look great on any body shape, but the waist does cinch without a lot of give, so pear-shapes may want to size up."
"8.0","I usually wear a 10-12 but sized up per all the reviews... they were spot on.","Im a 38C/D and the 12R was way too tight across the bust.","The 14R fit much better and the length was totally fine - I actually thought it was a little short for a 14.","(I wore 2.5 inch heels...anything taller would have made the bottom look too short.)","The zipper is sticky...","I was able to do it myself a few times, but it was much easier if someone else zipped me up.","The neckline and armpit area where definitely scratchy.","I was red when I took it off, but not big deal.","Finally - the back is LOW.","Like you need to go braless or sticky cups (not an option for me), get a really low back bra, or buy the straps from Nordstroms that pull your bra straps down and wrap about your front to hook.","My one complaint is that the back seam (up the butt) was torn/undone.","I was able to make it work with fashion tape from the inside, but that could have been bad."
"8.0","I wore this to a black tie wedding in Carmel CA, it was perfect for the event!","The dress is true to size however it runs a little long, I had to hold the bottom of my dress up for the majority of the outdoor ceremony so it wouldnt soak up any moisture in the grass.","I would rent this dress again in a heartbeat and wear higher heels."
"8.0","This dress arrived in decent condition, although the lace at the ends of the sleeves is relatively frayed.","The dress is very beautiful and delicate, but does not have a lot of stretch-factor, so the 6 just barely fit.","It was also relatively short on me (I am 510 so most things are) but felt perfectly comfortable with black tights and high heels.","I got plenty of compliments on the dress throughout the evening.","The dress is both pretty and classy, perfect for a work event where you start the evening with your boss and end it dancing at the after-party.","Highly recommend."
"8.0","Dress fit perfectly for its designated size.","Form fitting -- not too tight in the curvy spots, but you may need help zipping it up.","While a bit too formal for the event, I received many compliments.","AND any excuse to wear a dress this beautiful I will definitely go more formal.","It is a stand-out dress."
"8.0","Loved the dress, but it was hot because fabric is not breathable"
"8.0","This sweater is very comfortable & quite warm.","Perfect for early spring or fall.","Its definitely boxy though, and runs on the shorter side which would be the cons in my opinion.","The actual sweater though is very well made and the weave on the front adds some dimension and character.","I wouldnt rent it again, but it did come in handy for a brisk spring vacation in Vermont."
"8.0","Had to pin the top collar together to keep it from looking to wide and casual for work but its a nice thick fabric for fall/winter"
"8.0","Wore this for my engagement photos in D.C. - wasnt a 1st, 2nd, or 5th choice but it fit, was comfortable & really pretty adorable.","The color is a perfect navy, and the sweet bow at the top of the back/zipper was a nice touch.","Bonus feature: pockets!","Perfect for daytime events, and overall, looked really nice in the photos.","One note, I did have a little side-boobage.","Couldnt wear a bra b/c of the back, but did have on the chicken cutlets.","At certain angles, there was slightly more boob than desired, but not spilling out."
"8.0","I loved this dress.","I just wish the top half for better.","It runs a little big so sometimes people didnt even know it had the cut-out.","Fashion tape could have helped but I didnt feel like putting any on.","I still received A TON of compliments."
"8.0","I would definitely rent this again for a night out.","The dress is short but makes the legs look great.","The material does not have any give and the top can be a bit tight for those with large chests."
"8.0","This dress runs about 1.5 - 2 sizes smaller than the conventional plus-size dress - I normally wear a 14/16.","However, the dress does run true to size based on the Theia size chart listed on Rent the Runway.","Regardless, based on my measurements and the size chart I ordered the 18, with 20 as a backup - which is a little big.","I have a full bust (38DDD to be exact) and have plenty of room; however, if you have full hips, I would suggest sizing up two sizes.","The dress is absolutely beautiful - the picture doesnt do it justice!"
"8.0","I usually wear a small or medium but the extra small worked out perfectly.","Im 59, and have difficulty finding the perfect length maxi dress (they are usually just a bit too short), but this dress was great for length!","The only downside-I wore the dress to a family picnic, I had to use a safety pin to cover up some cleavage."
"8.0","I wore this for a night out.","Im 55, so the length was definitely not cropped on me, but it looked fine with heels.","Love the pockets and open back (I didnt wear a bra and didnt find one was necessary thanks to the many layers around the bust area).","Would definitely recommend if youre looking for a fun alternative to a dress!","Found it fit true to size, but was a little roomy everywhere.","If youre looking for something a bit loose and comfortable, this is a great pick."
"8.0","I wore this dress for my graduation dinner and I loved it.","It was the perfect fun dress and it was super comfortable."
"8.0","This dress looks very nice and professional.","Im deducting a star because the colors were kind of drab and boring, and it made me look wider from the front (flattering from every other angle though).","It fit well and was appropriate for the office.","Safe choice for a business meeting."
"8.0","Normally Im an 8, but I followed the suggestions and went up a size to a 10 for my backup.","The 8 fit well, but it felt super short!","Im 55, so dresses being too short isnt usually an issue for me.","This dress is cute and has a swingy bottom half, though, so I wore the 10 and while it was a little loose in my hips and waist, I felt better about having bare legs.","The fabric and lining is super comfy, but like other people, I got warm easily.","Also, this wasnt really an issue for me, but this dress would NOT be forgiving at all for any sort of belly pooch.","Not because its tight, but just because of the way its cut.","Otherwise, it seems like itd be great for any body type; I wish I had less narrow hips as it emphasized my boobs-on-a-rectangle shape!","(I still loved the dress and got tons of compliments!)"
"8.0","The dress fit great, true to size.","The only problem I had was the zipper was almost impossible to zip up.","I was a little worried, but after 15 minutes of trying it finally zipped.","The dress was comfortable and I received many compliments.","Be prepared for extra cleavage if you are big busted.","I am a 34D and I had a hard time trying to keep my bra from showing in the front.","However, I used clothing tape and it seemed to work majority of the night."
"8.0","One of my favorite rompers!","Its really cute and the red lace is  beautiful.","Only issue that I had with it is that the neck is really tight.","But I just didnt zip it up to the very top and was fine since my hair was long enough to cover it!","#Sweeps Entry but the opinions in my review are my own honest views."
"8.0","I wore this to a ball.","The 8R wasnt available so I sized up.","The fabric is stretchy so a 10R worked fine though was a little long for me (even though Im 58).","I didnt get the scratchiness from the sequins that others had but the shoulder straps were a little lose (i think because i had to go up a size).","The rouching is very flattering and I got compliments all night!"
"8.0","Loved this dress!","Super comfortable to wear - the back added a classy but also a little sexy accent.","Received a ton of compliments."
"8.0","I wore this to a business formal dinner/event.","It felt even more conservative on than it appears in the picture.","It is a high quality thick fabric.","I wore it with sexy shoes, long hair down with waves and as chunky necklace to keep it young, but with an updo and long earrings it would look elegant.","There is a little more color in the dress when up close (blues, greens, purple?)","but the sleeves are black.","It is very pretty and elegant but not a stunner.","I would recommend wearing a lighter colored or bright necklace to pop against the hight neckline."
"8.0","Wore this dress for a day of marathon meetings at work.","I got so many compliments!","It was just a touch too long on my 50 frame and hit just below my knees, but it fit pretty well everywhere else.","There isnt much give in the chest area, so Id recommend sizing up if you need a little extra room in that area."
"8.0","Love this  jumpsuit, Ive now rented it twice!!","!"
"8.0","Pros: This dress is essentially Spanx designed for public consumption.","My butt looked just 100.","Cons: Lots of hoisting, even with the gummy material inside to prevent sliding.","I combined my hoisting with lots of hair flipping to make it look more fluid?","I dont know."
"8.0","Short but it was fine because I am 52.","Got lots of compliments."
"8.0","It fits pretty snug, but very comfortable.","Good quality dress!!","Not too short on me, hit a few inches above my knees."
"8.0","Ive rented several of the Rebecca Taylor jackets, and this felt smaller than the others at the same size.","A little bit of stretch throughout.","Nicely crafted with many details."
"8.0","Rented this dress for my civil ceremony at City Hall.","Not a style I normally pick - I have broad shoulders and a narrow waist and dont normally do high-neck dresses.","But this fit surprisingly well!","The waist was a little higher than I would have liked - sat above my natural waist so it wasnt as fitted there.","Also the color was more grayish than I thought it would be.","But the fabric was really high quality and I got lots of compliments (so Ill reconsider this dress style in the future!)"
"8.0","I wore this for my bridal shower.","The little touch of blue - and the detail on the collar are beautiful - so I decided to wear my hair up to highlight these features.","Dress fit perfectly; however, it was tighter up top & did smash my chest down."
"8.0","The color was gorgeous, but the dress was a little long and bunched quite a bit in the back.","I was fiddling with it all night.","I think it is mostly because of my (lack of) height- this would probably be great on a taller person!"
"8.0","This dress was true to size and I loved it!","I received compliments all night and thats how I knew I picked the right dress.","One thing I did notice was that it seemed to be short.","I usually have gowns fit a little long since Im only 54 but I found this dress to be short!","Luckily I had great shoes to pair the dress with so I definitely recommend a lower heel for this one.","Thanks again, RTR!"
"8.0","This dress was comfortable and a beautiful color.","I usually am between a size 2 and 4 and the 2 fit perfectly.","I could not find these bra strap holders that were mentioned in some of the reviews so I wore my bra crossed in the back and it was PERFECT.","My only complaint was that it was a little bit too conservative to me to have such a high neck line AND be so long- about knee length (usually I try to pick one or the other).","Although it was a beautiful dress it just was too long and the wrong proportion for someone who is 53.","I did still feel beautiful and I was not worried about bending over if I dropped something or to take my shoes off because my legs were so covered.","If you are looking to wear a dress you want to feel comfortable in, (and maybe if you are taller than 56) this is definitely the dress for you!"
"8.0","Runs a little large, and the outer straps kept falling off, but this was expected because other reviewers claimed the same thing.","It can be fixed with dress tap, but honestly, I just let it fall..the off the shoulder look is in anyways.","There was a tiny hole in the lace at the back of the dress, but my hair was long enough to cover it.","All in all, great fit and beautiful color."
"8.0","The dress was very comfortable, I did find that the sleeves were very snug,  Once the dress was on I really liked how it looked."
"8.0","As others mentioned, this dress is roomy.","I wore size 12.","Im usually a 14 for designer labels such as these.","The dress was fun & bright.","It doesnt have much shape to it, which can be good or bad, depending on what youre looking for.","If you are a curvier woman such as myself, this dress style ends up looking like a bag on you.","But damn, that bag is comfortable!","The fabric was well made, not thin but not too thick either.","I wore a strapless bra & normal underwear.","Huzzah!","I would definitely recommend if you want a comfortable party dress."
"8.0","I am 5 4 so this was not the right dress for me.","Beautiful and stylish, but the length made me feel shorter than I already am.","I sent it back without wearing it.","A taller customer could really knock it out of the park with this one, but sadly, not me."
"8.0","Pros: Gorgeous, vibrant color, great material, fun sleeves, good length.","Cons: Its a little tight, especially in the chest area and Im not large chested.","I am still rating it as true to size since Im between a 2 and 4, but ordered the 2 based on other reviews."
"8.0","Fit a little more snug.","The 0 fit better overall but found it to be too short and felt more comfortable in the 2."
"8.0","If you are over 57, this dress doesnt run small or short."
"8.0","I absolutely loved this dress.","The fabric and the way it moves when you walk makes you feel very elegant, and the color is to die for.","I will say, the bust area of the dress is a little difficult to deal with.","I used fashion tape to try to keep it in place; I also used fashion tape for the straps, as they were loose and prone to fall down.","The tape helped, but the fabric didnt do a great job of sticking to it, so I had to keep readjusting it.","Due to the low back, I chose not to wear a bra; Im a D, and nubras really dont do anything for me.","I just used the fashion tape to keep everything in place, which worked for the most part.","It just required a lot of monitoring to make sure the fabric was still sticking to the tape.","In general, I would say the dress was true to size.","I gave it four stars rather than five, only because of the constant adjusting I had to do to keep from flashing everyone.","Overall, I loved this dress and would highly recommend it!"
"8.0","Very pretty dress.","Thick materials and perhaps not good for the hot summer weather.","Good for the office with strong AC"
"8.0","This top is so cute.","Would have given it all the stars but the sides come down a bit low.. showed my bra."
"8.0","The fit itself was great, however, the length for the size I wore was very long.","Im about 53 and the slit was pretty far up my leg, so I had to be careful when holding my dress up that other things wouldnt show.","Despite the length, it was a great dancing dress!"
"8.0","There is no stretch in the top; I was between sizes but had to go w 6; Overall looked great for a work formal event.","Would recommend."
"8.0","The fit was flattering.","Typically I wear a size XS, but the small fit me well-although it was on the tight side.","The only downfall of this dress was the sequins-they scratched my arm and were a bit uncomfortable."
"8.0","Easy to wear.","Fits as expected."
"8.0","I rented this dress for a big party and it was absolutely stunning.","But the sizing is so far off its almost comical.","I read from previous renters that this dress runs small, so I took S instead of XS.","The small was so tight I was worried the seams would bust open."
"8.0","Gorgeous dress!","Received in perfect condition.","The navy sequins give just the right amount of sparkle and the sheer sleeves made the dress oh so elegant.","Runs slightly large and probably could have worn the next size down.","I would definitely rent this one again!"
"8.0","I rented my normal size 0 and a backup size 2 for a wedding in NOLA.","When I got the dresses (the night before I took a 5am flight), I noticed that the size 0 was all messed up!","The lining was longer than the lace, and it just did not look right.","I called RTR, and they offered to overnight me another dress, but I tried on the 0 and that fit nicely!","The 0 neck was very tight as well, so the 2 was the perfect size!","It was fun to dance in, as when I spun around, the dress twirled too!"
"8.0","This dress is surprisingly comfortable given its more form fitting shape.","Im 59 and definitely needed the longer length.","I got lots of compliments on the dress and felt great in it all night."
"8.0","I ordered sizes 16W & 18W.","The 16W fit nicely; however, it was too short for my 511 frame so I went with the 18W dress instead.","Nice shimmer on the dress; however, some of the beading was a bit loose."
"8.0","Pros: Great dress, very simple but nice.","The fit was pretty much perfect once I wore it for a while it wasnt as tight.","It was comfortable all around and I didnt feel that I needed to pull the top up all night like I tend to have to do with strapless dresses!","Would recommend!","This was my first rent the runway and I was nervous but it turned out great!","Cons: The color is not as pink as it looked in the picture which was disappointing but it was still really pretty.","The length is super long unless you have tall high heels, my heels were good in height as the dress covered my toes but it was still a bit longer than I wanted."
"8.0","This was  a really cute dress, which was also really low cut.","Fortunately I had a cami on hand that was the exact same color as the flowers so it was a perfect match!","The dress was really cute, comfy and I received a lot of compliments on it."
"8.0","The dress fit well, however the snap that holds it in place is not to be trusted.","If you are renting this dress, I would highly recommend securing it with safety pins before you go out.","Additionally, the line where the fabric meets the mesh irritated my skin slightly.","For those two reasons Im giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, but overall I loved it.","Very stylish and different.","I wore this to a wedding in California, and RTR shipped it directly to my hotel.","I was definitely worried that it would not be there when I arrived, but they nailed it.","So convenient!"
"8.0","THe dress did have some pulls in the lace over lay."
"8.0","I loved this dress and wore it for a night out on the town!","I loved how my shoulders looked and felt very comfortable and sexy in it."
"8.0","I fell in love with the photos and thought this would be perfect for the fall.","I ordered a small and tried it on.","Unfortunately, it looked way big on me.","I am also 51.","I wanted a nice loose comfy sweater/jacket but this one didnt suit my frame.","I was so sad to return it.","This would be suitable for a taller person."
"8.0","Nice dress to wear during winter.","It runs little large, so I recommend size down."
"8.0","I am very full chested (36DDD), so I did leave the front snaps undone.","Even so, it was not too revealing.","I am typically a size 6/8 and I ended up going with the 6.","It is a perfect length.","The only complaint I do has is that the extra fabric on the side wasnt always aesthetically pleasing."
"8.0","A little loose around the waist, but other than that very flattering!"
"8.0","This dress ran a little small on me.","I typically wear a four, but definitely needed the six.","Glad I got the back-up size.","The six fit like a glove, and doesnt have any stretch.","The dress is beautiful and I received tons of compliments.","The quality, fabric, god embroidery, and tulle skirt detail were all wonderful."
"8.0","Pretty pattern and for being tall I typically worry about length, but was not too short (mid thigh).","Top was definitely too large, but pinned it and it worked great."
"8.0","This dress is beautiful!","I ordered this and another for two events I had in two nights.","I ended up having to cancel one event and didnt want the dress to not get worn.","I let my coworker wear it for the event we were going to together and it looked fabulous on her.","She is 58 and a size 4 and the 4 fit her perfectly.","The 4 was just too long for me, but fit everywhere else."
"8.0","runs tight AT first, but loosens up.","Thicker fabric and very cute"
"8.0","The quality of this dress was amazing, the subtle ruffles and button accents were romantic and beautiful.","The skirt was long enough for a tall girl, even with heels.","I typically wear a 4, and the arms may have been a bit more comfortable if I had sized up from the 2.","Overall, gorgeous."
"8.0","This was my first RTR experience and I felt this dress would be very figure flattering to my body type.","I was on a crunch for time and liked it but wasnt sure I loved it.","I am a big fan of the metal belt trend and added it covering the bow belt sewn onto the dress.","I am glad for the free second size because that is what ended up fitting best.","I received compliments all night, as did my date.","I wore it to a Marine Corps Ball and couldnt be happier with the choice!"
"8.0","This dress was perfect for a Navy ball.","Im glad I ordered a size down since its not very fitted.","The 2R was good, but almost too long.","Im 57 , wore four inch heels and I was a little worried about stepping on it.","It came to the very bottom of my shoes.","I never did try it on with a bra since theres a little support already in there.","I am so happy I paired it with a rented necklace.","I felt beautiful in my rent the runway  outfit!"
"8.0","I was nervous as this was my first RTR rental but I ordered the 4R and 2R - the two was slightly too small, the four fit well- however I am 54 and most reviews said with 4 inch heels it would be perfect I had 3 inch shoes on and it was a little over an inch short - it worked out fine bc it was raining all day & once I took my shoes off I was fine - just keep that in mind.. Gorgeous dress, beautiful color."
"8.0","Very pretty dress.","I was a bit out of my comfort zone with this rental.","I usually always go with very fitted (and typically black) dresses.","I was pleasantly surprised with this but it was definitely too big.","My boyfriend also wasnt a huge fan of the bottom of the dress.","I think I would have been more in love if I would have went down a size."
"8.0","This dress is tight in the waist (and spanx did nothing to help!)!","And difficult to zip right at the waist.","All other areas fit pretty true to size.","I actually couldve probably fit into the 4 had it not been for the extra slim waist.","I didnt order up as a back up but Im certain the 8 wouldve been too big in other areas.","A couple of times the sleeves slipped off my shoulders but it wasnt anything persistent enough to annoy me.","The cleavage wasnt too revealing at all on me (a concern I had following other reviews).","I wore this for my sons 1st Communion and it was perfect for the occasion.","I received several compliments.","The quality of the lace was exquisite.","Overall a beautiful dress."
"8.0","The style of the coat is lovely- its beautiful and not too heavy but enough to keep you warm during a San Diego winter.","However, I noticed that the lining of the coat was falling apart and one of the buttons had nearly fallen off the coat.","Overall, worth renting if youre only going to wear it once, but not worth buying if you want something that is going to last."
"8.0","This gown is beautiful!","I am not sure if it was a defect in the dress or if all are like this, but the zipper is nearly impossible to handle.","It took my husband and another friend to help me get the dress zipped.","Once in, though, the dress is gorgeous.","I was in a knee brace so luckily I needed low heels, but otherwise the dress would have been too short.","So, if you are 55 and want to wear heels, order the long."
"8.0","I wore this to an outdoor wedding and it was a perfect color for a spring wedding, but beware, its brighter than it looks in the picture.","All in all, a great dress, good for hiding imperfections, too, like a growing belly that youre not ready to talk about!"
"8.0","This dress fits true to size, I was a little worried about the length because Im 5 and 111 lbs, petite.","But it ended up fitting perfectly.","It was elegant and sexy at the same time.","I got a million compliments that night and they even named me best dress of the night.","The only con this dress has is that the lining does show in the back but I was able to tape it, other than that....","Perfect!"
"8.0","This is a fitted dress so dont freak out when you get it.","Nice thing is material is very stretchy.","I have a full C cup bust and was nervous about moving around and potential under boob slippage so I wore my own black bandeau under the dress bandeau for the extra coverage.","If you have a B cup or smaller no bra would be needed.","This dress definitely will make people turn and look so if you have the confidence go out and rock it girl!"
"8.0","The dress was really fun with all the sequins and great for a party, but I had some issues with the fit.","I have a small bust and probably couldve worn a size smaller than my usual size because the top had difficulty staying up.","The dress is fairly short though so Im not sure if a size smaller wouldve been way too short on me.","I used fashion tape to keep the sleeves up but I still didnt feel confident that they would stay up all night, especially with dancing.","I felt like I had to keep adjusting the sleeves most of the night.","The back of the dress is beautiful though!"
"8.0","The dress is gorgeous, and it is very accommodating if you have a growing belly!","However, the zipper was very, very hard to zip up on the size 2, and the banded part was very tight across my ribs.","I tried the 4, but it seemed like it didnt fit better across my chest and was just wider on my hips so I went with the 2.","Breathing was a little difficult after I ate, but hey, pain is beauty, right?","Ultimately, I will most definitely use this service again because the process was so simple!","!"
"8.0","This dress was very flattering and elegant.","The material was thick enough to hide any imperfections.","My only complaint with it was that the train in the back was very long and was not pictured in the model photo.","I am 58, 126lbs and I ordered the size 2R and 2L.","The regular size was about an inch or two too short in the front but the back still hit the floor (I wore 2.5 inch heels).","I wore the size 2L but had to tape about 5 inches of the dress in the back with fashion tape so it didnt drag on the floor.","The fashion tape actually held up extremely well and I was not tripping over the dress all night.","It did make a little bit of a ripple effect on the back though.","Overall, I loved the dress despite the long train."
"8.0","It was more plunging on than I realized.","Otherwise fit well.","I would have worn the size 10 but it looked like a heel had been stuck in the hem leaving a small hole and the hem was torn out in a small area.","I recommend Hollywood Fashion tape for the neckline.","Loved the dress"
"8.0","This dress is flattering & slimming!","It was fun to wear & definitely an attention-getter.","Its very tight, but the material stretches.","It looked better with a strapless bra vs braless.","I had to privately readjust the dress to pull it up about 10 times in a 6 hour time period.","I was doing a lot of dancing though.","The silicone band at the top of the bust on the inside to help with grip was partially worn off the XS and mostly worn off on the S. My dress arrived on time as promised."
"8.0","I think it fits great, HOWEVER, it was pretty snug around my boobs (Im a 34D).","I think a 4 would have been a bit more comfortable, but it was still super cute none the less!","I wore this to work and got so many complements!","(please excuse the picture lol... no full length mirror so I used a reflective window!)"
"8.0","It fit beautifully throughout, however the top sheer part was a bit big.","I tucked it in in the back with a lot of fashion tape,  which helped it look right, but by the end of the night, you could see the fashion tape ... not so attractive.","All this said, the dress looked beautiful."
"8.0","These were a great pair of high waisted slacks.","I did wish they were a 1/2 longer due to my height but if I got them again I would probably just order a size larger so they could fit lower on my waist."
"8.0","Really enjoyed this dress!","The fabric is a nice weight for fall and has a bit of stretch.","If I rented it again I would wear some spanx underneath since it wasnt the most forgiving for both bra/panty lines and my various trouble spots.","It was also comically difficult to walk up stairs in it?","Worth it for the overall look though!"
"8.0","Loved this dress.","A little long (even with 4 heels) but very happy and received tons of compliments!"
"8.0","I had my son 3 months ago, so finding a dress that fits me when Im usually 10lbs lighter and 2 cup sizes down was daunting.","I went into a store in Chicago to try on dresses and the associate assured me the 6 or 8 would fit.","Customer service was great when neither of them did--sent me the 10 and 12 by noon the next day (day of the event!)","I could close the 10, but it was a bit tight on the tummy so I went for comfort.","This is a good and forgiving dress for new moms, though it does run tight on the band around the middle so order a size up if youre in the same position as me.","Got lots of compliments on the color and was super comfortable in this dress.","Light and great for dancing!","Also worked well with 3 inch heels in regular."
"8.0","The fit was slightly large and being a shorter person, it hung a little lower than I prefer, But it was quite comfortable and flattering."
"8.0","I rented the 4R and 6R.","I wore the 4R because the sides of the 6R were gaping on me (27in waist).","The 6R fit 34D chest better though, definitely a dress for A-C unless youre cool with cleavage for the night.","It comes with 2 clasp settings on the top bra half, so I wore the 4R on the looser clasps.","I was at a scene-y event in Los Angeles so it was appropriate for the occasion.","I wouldnt wear this to a wedding or family event if youre top heavy unless youre cool with cleavage.","Im 53 and wearing 4 inch heels and the dress was still too long.","I wish it came in petite sizes.","I tripped atleast 1-2x going up the stairs but when I remembered to grab the dress before stairs I was fine.","Im all for this dress despite the small things!","!"
"8.0","Great dress for a cocktail party or summer wedding.","The only reason that I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the bunching around the belt area.","Other than that it was great.","Photographs very well too."
"8.0","I needed a dress for a pineapple costume.","This dress was just right.","I am fairly short and it wasnt too long, even without heels.","The color is bright and cheery, plus this bad boy has pockets.","I am small chested and the top was tight and has boning, which was very flattering for me and meant it could be a no-bra night, but I would guess would not be as great for larger bosoms.","The only flaws were that it was a bit difficult to zip and that the bottom of the dress didnt fall as nicely as it does it the picture; the fabric is rather stiff.","Overall, I was happy with the dress and would probably even wear it when not living the life of a pineapple."
"8.0","The dress runs small.","I normally wear a size 6/8 and ended up in the size 10 dress that was sent as my backup.","The built in bra was great as well."
"8.0","When I tried this dress on in the Vegas store, the size 8 was perfect but when I got the dress it was a little tighter of a fit.","My guess is the floor model was a bit stretched out.","Even still the dress was comfortable all might long through hours of dancing.","The color definitely stood out at the wedding and the lace was right on trend.","I would recommend wearing spanx and a low back bra with this dress  as even a regular strapless would peak through when I sat down.","All in all it was a fabulous dress I would rent again and would certainly love to own!","I wish I had taken more pictures in it"
"8.0","I was looking for a dress with sleeves for a night out in March.","The dress worked well for the occasion.","I paired it with a pair of green statement earrings."
"8.0","I rented this dress for my engagement pictures.","It was a fantastic choice.","I usually wear a size 2 because I can get away with it since my girls are pretty small, but this dress cut it super close.","The top is VERY tight.","I couldnt wear a bra because my bra didnt fit under it, but the dress fit everywhere else.","Luckily though, the dress is lined very well and a bra wasnt needed, even for pictures.","It looks pretty much exactly like what the pictures look like so theres no shock when you first pull it out of the bag.","Overall, great dress!","I probably wont rent it again, but I loved it."
"8.0","I wore it to a wedding  & it was quite hot that day (high 80s)  I was afraid that material would be too thick & Id be super hot.","I wasnt, it was excellent, comfortable.","Easy to dance in & the colors are just beautiful.","So much more vibrant in person.","I did wear a corset waist trainer with it & my regular everyday bra.","Great dress!","Would rent again"
"8.0","This dress fit almost perfectly and was very flattering.","The material is a little thick, but wasnt uncomfortable and  made the dress lie very smoothly.","The only drawback is it was a bit too long on me even with heels."
"8.0","Runs small in the chest region.","I am a 36 C and had to wear the L because the M would not zip up around the bust region - mostly due to a fabric ridge that was tough to get the zipper over.","Even with the large it was a little uncomfortable in the neck region as many people have stated in other review.","That being said, it was such a cute dress!"
"8.0","I wore this to my sororitys formal (that explains the kite pictures).","The fit was perfect.","I have a big butt and boobs, so I get nervous about form-fitting dresses because theyre usually too tight in those places and too loose in the stomach.","The fit of this dress is perfect for anyone with an hourglass shape, as the material is the perfect amount of stretchy and structured.","I got so many compliments on how this dress looked on me and my boyfriend loved it!","The only complaints I have about this dress is that I couldnt wear a bra with it because it was tight but the material was thick enough that no one could really tell, and the dress was very plain.","At first I wasnt too excited about it because of the lack of details,  but after I added a necklace and did my hair I was more satisfied."
"8.0","Runs slightly large, especially in the hip area.","Not too much exposure  up top.","Elegant lace."
"8.0","This dress is a showstopper.","With the deep green color and sequins you will be turning head at your event.","It was form fitting but very stretchy.","It will definitely show off your curves in a good way.","For a formal event this will absolutely be on my list of choices!"
"8.0","It was tight on my chest, while I felt like it looked good my boobs were compacted in there.","Overall good experience.","Good for girls with wide hips and small waist."
"8.0","I am 58 and it was bordering on the verge of inappropriateness due to the length."
"8.0","Runs quite small.","I wore the 2 and had to squeeze in.","I wish i had listened to the other reviews and sized up."
"8.0","The dress fit well, and the material was very thick.","I found myself a bit warm in it, but it was a PERFECT dress for my Bridal Shower.","The length was perfect for the sitting/opening gifts portion of the shower.","I wish the white would have been a little brighter, though.","It seemed rather dull, but you could still tell I was the bride at the shower, so all was well!","Paired with minimal makeup,  nude pumps, and a chunky pink bracelet."
"8.0","As others have described, the neckline was a little bit lower than it looks on the model, and the way the straps are makes it tough to wear a strapless bra.","I ended up wearing a deep-plunging racerback bra and hid the straps pretty well (though they appeared in some pictures).","I am 54 and I wore 3 inch heels.","The length (regular) ended up being perfect.","The material is heavy but does show lines, so make sure you have seamless underwear.","It was a really comfortable dress to wear and I got so many compliments on it all night (as well as after the event, when photos were posted).","When I first tried it on, I thought it made me look big because I have such a short torso, but everyone who saw me in the dress loved it and I am still getting comments on my outfit that night (a month later).","I got both the MR and the LR.","I usually wear a size 8 in dresses and a size 6 in pants.","The MR fit perfectly and I didnt even try the LR on.","My one complaint: the zipper was tough to do up.","Im not sure if it was a new dress or what the issue was, but it felt like it was stuck.","Overall, really good quality for a great price."
"8.0","The dress was a nice fit and flattering.","Overall not my favorite rental, it felt a little promy–but it was a good fit and well made with a nice crepe material.","The gold fabric was slightly more stiff, which gave nice shape to the skirt."
"8.0","I wore this dress as a bridesmaid dress for my best friends wedding.","Very fun, flirty dress.","Thicker fabric, so it was a little hot for a mid-June wedding in DC with temperatures about 91 degrees.","I usually wear a size 6, but had to go up to a size 8 due to a tight fit in the bust/ribs.","All bridesmaids actually had to wear a size larger than normal size.","The pockets were perfect for the event!","I helped keep track of the brides phone/lipstick all day with no trouble - huge pockets!","The dress does have a significant cupcake-like flare that makes you look wider, but that is just the style/cut of the dress, so keep that in mind; side view very slimming due to snug fit around the rib cage."
"8.0","It is a great fit but a little tight in the torso area.","Definitely recommend going a size bigger than what youre normally used to!","Otherwise, it is a great dress and very pretty!"
"8.0","The dress is very forgiving and comfortable.","I ordered from RTR to wear something fun that I dont have to own."
"8.0","The dress fit like it was made for me, except that it was a bit short!","I wore shorts underneath to avoid being too revealing when I had to lean.","It was otherwise beautiful.","The material is heavy so I stayed warm and I got a lot of compliments for its unique look."
"8.0","The sequins were a bit scratchy under the arms at first.","Eventually, I forgot they were there!","The front does dip a little lower than I was expecting.","But I wasnt going to a formal event, so I wasnt too worried about the amount of cleavage showing.","Overall, it was a great experience!","I would definitely order from renttherunway.com again!"
"8.0","i was unsure what size to get, as i am still nursing my baby so the boobs are a little out of control these days.","the zipper was tricky enough that i actually thought it didnt fit at first.","i ordered the emergency back up and found it way too big, so tried again on the original size and it was fine.","it was comfortable and easy to wear.","a safe bet for a first time rental."
"8.0","The fit was a little snug in the torso and long slightly long in the legs (with 4in heels)...I have short legs but a long torso.","Otherwise it fit like a glove no bra needed filled up the top and was able sit down without worrying about being the show.","I received so many compliments and if this came in another color besides red I would totally rent it again!"
"8.0","I love this dress!","Its simple, but a brilliant cut for any body type especially if youre a self-conscious in body-con dresses.","Like other reviews have mentioned, the color is definitely closer to a red than the picture on the site leads you to believe.","I would also like to note that I rented the same dress in pink for a previous wedding and for whatever reason the length and fit was much better despite the fact that I wore the same size to both events.","If youre debating between this color and the pink, I would suggest going with the latter.","Both are great, but the pink is ever so slightly better!"
"8.0","I rented this dress for a family wedding this past weekend and it was a huge hit!","I got so many compliments on how beautiful it was, how great the colour was (my date, oddly enough, had a matching blue dress shirt, which was completely unplanned), and how flattering it was on me.","I originally ordered the size 10, but thank goodness for the free second size because the ten was just too tight around the chest I couldnt zipper it up comfortably.","However, when I put on the 12, it was a bit too loose around the waist, even if it did fit my chest perfectly.","So, I put on a black belt to cinch the waist in and it worked out great.","Plus, I think it added a little extra something to the dress which would have seemed a bit matronly without a little flair."
"8.0","I usually wear a 0, but the 0 was much tighter on me than it looks on the model.","The fit of the 0 was fine on top, but through my hips and rear (where I am curviest) I was worried it was too tight and worried that the tightness caused the zipper to poke out in a weird way.","These were all small things, but for this reason I went with the 2 (pictured here).","Overall, it was a little large, but I think it felt fine and looked ok as well.","Wore a 3-4 heel, and the back did not drag."
"8.0"," A classic DVF wrap dress, nothing extraordinary about it.","As per the usual with DVF the fabric was high quality and the tailoring was well done."
"8.0","I rented this to wear at a friends luau birthday party and was so glad I did.","This dress has such beautiful colors and a unique print.","I was comfortable all evening on a warm August night.","If I were to rent this again, Id size up because it was tighter than I like around my bottom 1/2."
"8.0","The dress fit well though do recommend a strapless bra.","The top part is more snug than the bottom which prompted me to wear the size 8 as opposed to a size 6."
"8.0","I wore this dress for a bachelorette party.","It was the perfect color (we were all supposed to wear pink) and I loved the lace.","The cut of the dress is not normally one I wear...the seam was in an interesting place, but it did create a fun flair to the bottom of the dress.","I got many compliments on the lace and the color of the dress.","As always, the renting process was easy and I love the new bag the dresses come in!","Such a great idea eco-friendly idea!",":) LOVE RTR!!","!"
"8.0","...and so did I!","Unfortunately, When I received my dresses, I was expecting two to be in the bag, but I only had one!","Apparently my backup size was unavailable, but instead of informing me of this, RTR only sent me one dress.","I was rather disappointed in that approach, especially considering the size i received was a but snug and it would have been nice to know that I was only receiving one size before the day of my event.","Fortunately, RTR was very apologetic for the inconvenience.","I still wore the dress, it was still fabulous, and Ill still get my dresses from here for any formal events I have to go to in the future.","c:"
"8.0","The 2 fit me better, as I usually wear a 2 in dresses, but the zipper was broken upon arrival.","The dress would be perfect for a winter event - the thickness of the dress plus gold polka dots.","However, I wore it to a summer wedding with pink pumps and it worked great!","Very comfortable, able to wear a real bra with it with no problems at all!"
"8.0","I rented this dress to wear during the day on vacation with my family.","It was very comfortable, soft material.","Dress is conservative yet very figure flattering."
"8.0","I ordered a MR and LR as a backup.","I ended up wearing the LR as the MR was too tight in the legs and it was more comfortable when sitting.","If you have a long torso, this wont work for you.","I was able to wear a strapless bra.","The only con to the LR was that it was slightly baggy in the seat.Overall this was a great rental and I would definitely recommend it."
"8.0","The color is much more neon than it looks in the picture - that being said, I still really liked the color.","Just be prepared to be bright!","Also, this run super big.","Like really big.","I am normally a 4, so I ordered a 4 and a 2.","I wore the 2, but it was still a bit big - I wish I would have order a 2 and a 0."
"8.0","Dress was sheer in bodice, but in a flattering way."
"8.0","This dress fit beautifully.","It was sparkly and really fun and glamorous to wear to a formal charity event.","Even though I wore the Long, I found that it was still a little bit short.","It would have been absolutely perfect just 1 inch longer, but the length would prevent me from renting it.","Just be aware that your shoes will show, the dress does not come to the floor like the models picture.","I received so many compliments on this dress all evening long.","The RTR process was absolutely seamless and I look forward to renting my next dress!"
"8.0","I loved the print of this dress.","The fit was okay but the dress was much more flared out than I expected.","It is stretchy material so it fit snug through the hips- and then mid-hip it flares out.","If you have larger hips (like I do) think about if you want to accentuate them before you rent this dress.","Also, I had to keep tugging the dress down because it would ride up a bit.","Overall, it was very cute and I liked it for this one time but wouldnt rent it again."
"8.0","Really cute dress, and the front unzips for easier walking/dancing.","You definitely need to wear some heels since its so form fitting and you want to add the length to it otherwise you look a little Kardashian in my opinion.","I was surprised when the 4 fit a little better than the 2 (smallest size offered) since I normally wear a 0, but the others were right: this dress really does run small.","And its a heavy, thick material that was a little tough for summer, especially with the turtle neck.","But, it was a fun dress and I was glad I rented it for a bachelorette party in NYC!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to an outdoor farm style summer wedding.","The color was beautiful and definitely a stand out!","The dress fit true to size and was comfortable to sit in and dance in all night!"
"8.0","I am 8 months postpartum and needed something for a black tie event to make me look beautiful and cover some extra baby weight.","This was a great fun dress but did run small.","My original size 8 in pink did not fit but RTR customer service is absolutely the best!!!","I had this dress at my door the very next day!!!","Fun dress to dance in and great color.","THis was my 1st RTR but def not the last!!!","!"
"8.0","Striking, colorful, form fitting, however it runs short, so tall girls beware as I spent a portion of the night making sure it wasnt riding up.","That being said, the dress is beautiful.","I wish I had a picture of the back to show how pretty the whole look is."
"8.0","I actually fit into the size 6 with the right bra, but I felt it was a bit short especially when I raised my arms above my head.","That wouldnt work for dancing at a wedding!","So I wore the 8, which made the hemline longer (but was still a mini).","The darts didnt quite hit me in the right places, but the thicker fabric and pattern hid the spots that were looser.","The wedding was on a boat, so the dress was really perfect for the nautical theme."
"8.0","I wore this dress for a black-tie wedding in January and received so many compliments on it.","I thought the dress was very comfortable to wear and was not restricting to dance, sit or move in.","I am about 510 and the LONG style proved to be perfect for me with 3 inch heels on.","I think the material was very unique and better quality than I was expecting.","The only reason I would give it 4 stars versus 5 is because the zipper on my dress stuck/jammed a bit when trying to put it on or take it off.","I felt very elegant in this dress and would highly recommend!"
"8.0","Im pregnant and was worried about this fitting with my small but definitely noticeable bump, and it was totally fine.","I had gotten a backup in a size up just in case, but wore my regular size anyway.","There was a little stretch in the fabric and it was pretty comfortable to wear all evening at a fancy Christmas party.","My only complaint is the slight rubbing of the sequins under my arms, but it wasnt bad.","It was also really nice that it had pockets because I just threw my phone in one and license, credit card, lip stick, and a bobby pin in the other and you couldnt even tell the pockets were there or had anything bulking them up.","Overall it worked out well and the sequins werent over the top!"
"8.0","I ordered this is a bigger size than usual even though it already has a baggy fit and Im so happy I did!","I wore this to work with slim black ankle pants and heels, then I basically just lived in the thing for a couple of days while hanging out at home until I decided that it was time to give it back.","The only reason I would not purchase this sweater is because the tag on the back of the neck is a little itchy, and for a sweater that costs this much, that shouldnt be happening."
"8.0","The dress and details with stitching was very unique."
"8.0","This is a BEAUTIFUL dress, it just didnt work for my skin tone (Im a redhead with fair skin).","I let a friend wear wear it and it looked great in her.","She was by far, the best dressed at the dinner.","Im curvy and this dress definitely clings to your curves but its still flattering."
"8.0","I wore this to a formal winter wedding and received several compliments.","The length was just right, but the waist run tight and you should size up or plan on not overeating.","I also recommend wearing a strapless bra since you can see the straps at the shoulder through the mesh.","If you have a larger bust like I do, you will likely have a bit of cleavage showing through the glittery top section."
"8.0","The color and lace are exquisite.","It is a standout dress in an understated and elegant way.","It brought in lots of compliments!","The dress is snug through the rib cage area.","Im usually a 12 but had to size up to comfortably fit.","Id imagine youd need to do the same if you are large chested or have a broad back.","A bra or undergarment was impossible for me to wear due to the lace and open and low back.","I was able to get away with it but would have been more comfortable and had a better fit with some support."
"8.0","Ill start out by saying that RTR obviously cares about its customers and really helped me out, since I didnt read the reviews closely enough and failed to order a size up.","I really needed the size 10, but it was unavailable, so they sent me the 12 instead.","It was definitely too big (as you can see in the photo around my waist), but I would rather have a dress be too big than skin tight (the 8 was definitely skin tight)... That being said, it was a little awkward given that this is a low cut dress and it being too big really accentuated that.","I needed to use a lot of fashion tape to (somewhat) alleviate it.","I felt like I was showing too much cleavage for a wedding (lol) but had no other choice.","All in all, Im happy RTR came through, and Ill plan more accordingly next time :D"
"8.0","I got so many compliments on this dress.","The gold was more understated in person, which I liked.","The back was the seller for me though, with the openness.","I did not wear a bra with it, as I am smaller in the bust and it was tight enough to hold everything in place.","It was so easy to dance around in, and I danced all night.","Only drawback was the neck area was a little tight and awkward but I made it work.","Thanks RTR!"
"8.0","Pro-good for wedding/event you will be eating or indulging at.","Comfortable and moving fabric.","I received many compliments."
"8.0","I wore this dress to a black tie event.","I didnt want to wear something long or super formal, so I chose this dress for its fun cut.","You can dress it up easily - I wore a short sparkly necklace and a sparkly bracelet.","It fits true to size.","The skirt is a very full skirt, so might be a bit too much material for some.","I personally would have preferred just a little less fabric, but the bigger skirt works well for pear shaped people like myself.","Im 52 and the length hit around the knee which was good for a black tie event.","The only complaint I have is that even though there is a lining under the skirt, the underside of the top materal is itchy so when I was sitting down my legs felt like they were getting pricked by something."
"8.0","Does not stretch, so make sure your size fits.","It was also a little baggy in the chest area  as Im not as developed as others."
"8.0","I loved this dress and got tons of compliments at the wedding I attended.","I ordered a size 4 & 6.","Im about 130-135lbs, definitely a 4 up top, but my hips/butt are more of a 6.","The 6 was way too big.","The 4 fit but was a little tight in the hips.","There is a slip underneath the dress which was tight in the hips, but the outer material was not.","The top part was a little big and I had to secure it under the arms with double-sided tape.","It was very comfortable to sit, stand, and dance in.","Pockets are always a plus!"
"8.0","It fit great.","Ended up wearing the 8 not the 6."
"8.0","I loved this dress.","Its so different and the red really stands out.","The body of the dress is an excellent fit and hugs in all of the right places.","The only negative is the sleeves are restricting."
"8.0","Loved this dress in terms of material and pattern.","Slightly tighter in the shoulders.","Many people at the conference asked if I was a flight attendant in this dress (for better or worse haha)"
"8.0","The fit was pretty true to size"
"8.0","The dress is very short (and Im only 52) and pretty tight around the bust.","Serious cleavage"
"8.0","This dress was very cute.","a bit long as Im short so went to my ankle instead of mid calf!","Def wear with heels to make it a bit more sexy."
"8.0","Fit was great, the cinched waist helps your figure but it wasnt quite stretchy enough to get into easily.","Theres a little room in the bust area for me because I dont have much but it still looked ok.","Sometimes keyhole dresses look silly if you dont have a chest like me but I think it was fine.","Definitely glitzy and fairly comfortable.","More than one random girl at the NYE party stopped me to say they loved the dress and I had to sing the praises of RTR!","Really the only big-ish downside was the sequins are kinda scratchy on your arms and it can get uncomfortable through the night.","Length was good for me too, though its a short skirt, definitely not a mini.","It was about mid-thigh on me I think or just below.","I felt great though because I looked ready to party!"
"8.0","Ran a little small around hips.","Other than that was a great dress!"
"8.0","Lots of compliments.","Slightly large on top - had to keep pulling up when dancing.","Overall, great dress."
"8.0","true to size"
"8.0","i orded a 12L and a 14L the 12 fit but the zipper it so hard to zip i was to scared to wear it and have the zipper break so i wore the bigger size and was totally comfortable.","Im 58 and with heel the length was just right."
"8.0","Gorgeous dress but not exactly made for women who have any type of curvy body.","It runs small so definitely order the size up for your backup dress.","The strap across the back would not work for me so I had to run it across the inside of the dress.","Lots of compliments on the lace detail."
"8.0","The fit around the rib cage was very snug and fitted, and the arm sleeves were a little snug on top but this could be that I have thicker arms on top too.","Overall I loved the dress and I diffinently will rent this classy cocktail dress again!","RTR Rocks!"
"8.0","This ran large.","Im normally an 8, but the 6 fit perfectly.","I LOVED having pockets.","As others have said, the v neck is not nearly as dramatic as on the model.","Im a 34 DDD and it was still covered up and classy looking.","I will say my arms were all scratched up from the sequins- red scratches and soreness for the next 24 hours, but honestly, so worth it.",":) Id rent this dress again in a heartbeat.","Tons of complements."
"8.0","Fit like a glove and looked beautiful.","The only problem is that the dress I received had a couple loose threads in the waist area but I dont think they were very noticeable."
"8.0","This dress is extremely flattering!","For someone with a smaller bust and wider hips, it really accented exactly what I needed.","Its a very classy and comfortable dress and I received compliments all night.","Only complaint was that it was too short and I had to pull it down a few times throughout the night.","So those with a bigger booty beware!"
"8.0","I am 52 and this dress didnt seem to hit me in the right places.","It was just a bit off on me.","I did wear it to work (did not take a photo though).","It was extremely well made and I think it would be a winner for someone 54 or taller."
"8.0","The fit of this dress depends on the size of your bust, and the dress does run a little small in the chest.","Im a 38DD at 23 weeks in my twin pregnancy and the XL was snug.","I ended up wearing the XXL since it was more comfortable.","The waist was very accommodating and I could have worn either size.","Material weight was perfect.","I would suggest a statement necklace or fabulous shoes because the dress itself is slightly bland."
"8.0","You can dress this up or down.","Great for vacation or around the town leisure"
"8.0","Lots of compliments, figure hugging.","As I have a long torso I felt that the waist was a little higher on me but still loved it:)"
"8.0","great black tie dress, fits like a glove."
"8.0","Great print for summer!","Fit was nice and great for work!"
"8.0","This was super cute on!","I went with a 6 just because this designer runs pretty tight in the arms and it was a good choice.","That made the waistline a little looser than I wanted... but it still fit nicely.","If you have bigger arms, Id suggest going a size larger."
"8.0","This fit TTS.","I am 510 and 135.","I wore the small.","Like other reviewers mentioned the sheer cutouts arent as visible in person.","It was a nicely made dress and I felt comfortable in it.","It did ride up a bit when I walked..."
"8.0","this dress is great.","great color, material and style.. it does run small (thank god for the back up size), and it highlights everything..so if you are not confident about your body, its not the dress for you.","The color is looked really pretty on my tan skin.","two thumbs up"
"8.0","i did love this... but it was a bit tight...if they made an extra large it would have fit perfectly... i had a baby a year ago and it was small in the hips and thighs, but the top fight great.","it was a great fabric and never wrinkled... when i loose a bit more baby weight i will definitely rent this again!"
"8.0","Super cute and appropriate for work.","A very flattering shape for someone who has wide hips.","It was on the border of running small but not quite.","If my hips were half an inch wider it would have been too tight but the bust fit perfectly.","The material does not have stretch.","I was worried the length wouldnt be flattering but even though it fell right above my knee, which usually cuts me off and makes me look shorter, thanks to the cut it still looked great.","The material is thick and high quality.","It does crease over the day but it still looks great.","Ideal for spring or fall."
"8.0","This jumpsuit has a flattering, comfortable fit.","It was fun to wear, and I received so many compliments from friends and strangers.","One drawback is that the pants are an odd length.","It seems like they should be either longer or shorter."
"8.0","Absolutely LOVED this dress.","Looser fit with a shorter length made for a comfortable but sexy combination.","Material is thicker so worked well for my event in a colder climate."
"8.0","Great fit with fabric that  has some give to it.","The bow adds a great feature piece to this dress without being over the top.","I got complimented on this dress so many times.","Definitely going to rent it again."
"8.0","I was hesitant to order a formal dress for my friends wedding because I am in the process of losing my baby bump.","The cut of the dress worked really well though.","The way the fabric nipped together under the bustling was very flattering.","The con was that the slit in the back was ripped higher from a previous renter.","Luckily I had double-sided fashion tape to hold it.","Otherwise it stuck out like a tail!","The length was perfect for me.","I wore 3 heels and it grazed the top of the shoe.","It was great for a NYE wedding.","Love RTR concept and although I havent been thrilled with the dress fit of most of my rentals, it was due to my post baby belly, not the beautiful dresses!","I will be back for more!"
"8.0","I wore this to a daytime going away party and received a lot of compliments on it.","It was a option to wear in front of parents but still look cute and flirty.","Runs a little big, I would have gotten an XXS if it were available.","Def a good pick for summer!"
"8.0","I got compliments all night.","Loved this dress.","Although there are some downsides.","First, the dress is definitely short.","I wore flats and it didnt skim the ground and I am definitely not tall.","Everything else was big on the dress expect where the top/bottom come together (the black middle section).","This occurred right at my rib cage and was incredibly tight and slightly hard to breathe.","But overall, I would still wear it again  because it was really stunning."
"8.0","True to size and very comfortable, although shorter than expected (I am 54).","The material is VERY thick and did not breathe resulting in a sweaty evening!","Nevertheless, great dress, great color!"
"8.0","The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because the material stuck together at the bottom and made it seem like it was bunching together.","Otherwise it was great."
"8.0","This was amazingly comfortable.","The top was well-constructed, so I needed only a sticky bra, which made it nice to have no strap issues.","I wore the 44.","The hip area is more hourglass than I am; the 40 and 42 fit my 36 hips better (and was not too tight there) but the tops were tight.","If the 44 were my dress I would have slimmed in the hips.","However, the slight looseness made it very comfortable for moving, not to mention eating.","No panty lines showed.","The fabric is forgiving and softer than I expected.","The dress was not hard to get into once I figured out the sleeves -- stepping in is best.","It is a bit more plum than fuchsia, in my opinion.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"8.0","Having to choose between dresses, I did not wear this dress due to the sizing.","Sizing: the dress runs a tad big up top and small on the bottom.","I am 52 and the shoulder portion of the dress was long in  length wise and loose on the arms and shoulders.","Not suitable for a person with a short torso.","Where it ran small was around the hips.","The top felt like an 8 and bottom like a 4.","I think this dress would look great on a long torso, small hips, tall build women.","Material: quality material that feels nice on the skin.","Not itchy or too thick.","Would be fun dress to dance in, It moves with you."
"8.0","Fits true to size.","Wish I would have rented the 8 instead of the 10, but the 10 still fit OK."
"8.0","Got many compliments, felt comfortable and on trend.","Was a little long but I wore very low heels."
