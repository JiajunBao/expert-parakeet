"10","An adorable romper!","Belt and zipper were a little hard to navigate in a full day of wear/bathroom use, but that's to be expected.","Wish it had pockets, but other than that-- absolutely perfect!","I got a million compliments."
"10","I rented this dress for a photo shoot.","The theme was Hollywood Glam and Big Beautiful Hats.","The dress was very comfortable and easy to move around in.","It is definitely on my list to rent again for another formal event."
"10","This hugged in all the right places!","It was a perfect dress for my event and I received so many compliments on it.","Not to mention customer service was great getting this to me in less than 24 hours!"
"8","I rented this for my company's black tie awards banquet.","I liked that this dress was short but was a little fancier with the sequins.","(I generally don't care for long dresses.)","I would describe the color as more rose gold than yellow gold.","I have blonde hair and fair skin, and the color was very flattering.","This is a very forgiving dress!","It's form fitting without making you feel like you're squeezed into it.","I would rent this one again.","Highly recommend!"
"10","I have always been petite in my upper body and extremely athletic.","I'm 5'9 and typically am a size 4,6,8 due to the fact I had a smaller upper frame and 34B cup.","Depends what fabric were talking about too!","However, because I have been lifting weights my back has grown (odd to add- but figured I'd say it knowing other people lift weights) My lat area is so wide that I was suffocating in a size 6.","If I wasn't as muscular in my back I would've been fine.","I would recommend to go up a size if you are into lifting weights and very broad in your upper body."
"8","Didn't actually wear it.","It fit perfectly.","The fabric is a little thicker, so higher quality.","Felt a bit too conservative for my taste.","I rented it for the color and loved the berry shade of red."
"10","This dress is so sweet.","I loved the print.","The fit is loose with a tie for the waist, which means it should flatter most figures.","Another win from Kate Spade!"
"10","Fit was great.","Maybe a little tight under the arms."
"10","I was nervous of it looking cheap when it arrived but I received a ton of compliments on it and it had built in support.","I am a 36D and there was still that I was able to wear a bra with it with no problem.","Wore with 3-4 heels and it was perfect length."
"10","The dress was very flattering and fit perfectly through my stomach and hips.","I have a booty so I always worry about how things are going to fit, but this was amazing.","I have a small chest and didn't fill out the built in bra as much as I would have liked, but it still looked great and I was comfortable in it.","The dress had more stretch and give than I thought it would.","I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy dancing and while I couldn't bust out break dance moves, I was able to dance without feeling completely restricted.","I am always a zero in dresses and this fit true to size.","I'm short, 5'3 and I thought the length was perfect with a heel.","Overall I'm very pleased with my order!!","Thank you RTR!"
"8","The dress arrived with a small hole in the beading on the front but wasn't too noticeable.","Glad I was able to get two sizes because the 4 was a little tight and would've made for an uncomfortable night of dancing!"
"8","This dress was absolutely gorgeous and I received so many compliments!","I wore it to a black tie NYE wedding, and even though it was short, I felt like the fabric, fit, and the way it sparkled made it fit in just fine with the other formal gowns.","I usually wear a 6 or an 8 in dresses.","I ordered a 4 and a 6, and true to other reviewers' comments, the 4 fit me very well.","The chest area was just a tad loose, but that typically happens when I try on dresses...nothing a more padded bra couldn't fix!","The cut and fit were very figure flattering.","By the end of the evening I experience a little chafing under my arms from the sequins, but that was after 5 hours and it was very minor.","Thank you RTR for a great first experience, I'll definitely be back!"
"10","The S was snug but in a good way.","I wore a push up bra, but this dress made me look like a 34C!","I wore spanx, too.","Overall great dress!","The only downside was that the sequins ripped up my bachelorette sash.","There were strings everywhere but still felt like a million bucks."
"8","I ordered this dress as a replacement because I thought my original order would be too small.","This dress fit my abdomen well, but it hung slack around my shoulders and neck.","I wouldn't recommend a large size for apple body shapes; get the smaller size and let it hug you!"
"10","Fit great, super flattering"
"10","Medium would have been a better fit but large worked for a night out.","Pants were high enough that they wouldve looked cute with a crop top too.","Very comfortable.","Would love to own a pair."
"10","This dress is just darling.","I would absolutely wear it again.","It fits true to size with a little room.","I have larger hips and this dress fit fine and highlighted my smaller waist.","It isn't too tight around your middle and I was really comfortable in this one.","I wore it out to dinner in Vegas and really felt amazing."
"10","Little tight, but loved this dress!!","!"
"8","This is a pretty and fun dress with vibrant colors.","I thought the dress ran true to size.","The picture of the dress on the model can make the dress seem too short, but the length was perfect for me who's a bit smaller in height.","I paired the dress with pink earrings (via RTR) and black heels."
"10","super cute, 8 was super tight so i wore the 10. if you have booty and hips prob want to get the 10. don't need bra and it has structure to give you shape.","the train in the back is extra classy to give it another emphasis for formal."
"10","I rented this dress for a spring wedding.","I had originally rented an 8 and 10 and when I saw that the straps were quite long (make sure you wear them criss-crossed), I contacted the RTR customer service who suggested sizing down.","I did that and ended up wearing the 6.","It fit great.","I wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day!","The top is fitted, so that helped to keep everything still while I was on the dance floor, too.","The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party.","The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long!","I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt.","I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want!","Lastly, I wore the Tova Blue Mohawk earrings which seem like they were made for this dress.","Compliments on those as well.","I can always count on RTR to make me look like a million bucks!"
"8","I wore this dress to my daughter's baptism.","It was perfect for a more formal, daytime affair.","I felt fashionable and put together, despite having the flu!","I received many compliments.","I paired the dress with nude pumps."
"10","Super cute; love the 3/4 length sleeves.","With a wider sleeve, I always want something shorter so that it doesn't drag.","I wore with black pants and pumps for the office, but could have dressed down with jeans too.","If I didn't hate ironing so much (and this shirt definitely needs to be ironed!!)","I would have bought it.","The gathering at the sleeves prevents this from being too big overall.","Note: wear with high-waisted pants or you'll show your stomach.","Ladies who are smaller across the shoulders could probably size down one, but I like the oversized fit."
"8","I loved everything about this dress!","Well made with a great color combination ( pictures don't do it justice).","My issue was after just having a baby, it did not hide the area I needed hiding & because of the way the skirt is shaped made me look slightly bigger.","I think it the top dropped down just a tad longer it would have looked better.","Not the fault of the dress.","My body just did not work well with this style"
"10","It fit perfectly - I have a small waist, normal-to-small bust and big hips, so it fit in all of the right places.","It was borderline too short, but I usually prefer a bit of length.","It was still easy to dance and sit in.","I got lots of compliments and finally recommended RTR to a few friends!"
"8","Absolutely beautiful dress.","The details were incredible.","Pros:-Unique -Elegant and sophisticatedCons-Extremely tight in the bust area (I had to wear a bra with no padding and it was still extremely tight).","I don't know if sizing up would be ideal, as every other portion of the dress fit well."
"10","This dress is absolutely perfect!","I originally grabbed this dress in the Georgetown RTR store as a back-up because it just looked pretty eh while on the hanger, but when I tried it on, I instantly felt like a princess.","I loved how it flowed, and it was such an easy dress to dance in all night.","I'm 5' 6 - 5' 7, and the dress was about an inch or two too long, and there is way too much fabric and layering to hem it with the tape they sell at RTR, but that was easy to fix with one inch Jack Roger wedges (easier to dance in as well :)).","Overall, the dress was amazing, the colors photographed perfectly, and  I felt great at my senior prom."
"10","Lovely fabric, heavier than I imagined it would be (somehow I thought billowy, but its softer and stiffer than that) but it runs small around the ribcage - my normal size gapped 2 inches.","I've sent it right back to try the larger size.","Pretty!"
"8","I wore this to a company holiday event and wanted something that would stand out.","I loved that it had long sleeves, making it feel modern but also more ideal for a company event, given that it did run short on me, being tall.","I got several compliments on the dress.","It fit well and the jersey material made it comfortable and stay in place."
"10","Will rent again"
"10","Gorgeous fit, I ordered two sizes (Small and Medium), both were great, could go with either one.","Small fit the best."
"10","The dress was beautiful and very comfortable.","The 4 actually was a little too long in the sleeve and the length.","The 2 was still a bit long but not a tripping risk.","It still was dragging a bit and I had to hold it up to walk and I am 5'5 and was wearing a pretty high  heel.","I received a lot of compliments on the dress and felt very glamorous.","I like plain, simple clothes so I really loved this as it was elegant and had beautiful structure but not flashy.","And did I mention soooo comfortable!!","!"
"10","I rented this for my birthday dinner at a downtown restaurant and loved every minute of it.","This jumpsuit is super flattering, sexy, classy and comfortable.","The only downside is the zipper, like other girls have mentioned.","Difficult to zip by yourself.","Highly recommend this and will definitely rent it again!"
"10","Fit was good.","Barely brushing the floor in the back with 3 heels"
"8","I am 5'10 and the Long was too short for me in the front.","Had I been able to try this dress on in the store, I probably would not have rented it because I really didn't like how short it was.","But other than that, the dress fit and felt great and I loved the way it looked.","I just wish it had been longer."
"10","Dress fit well and had a very classy feel to it.","Rented it for a meeting I had to attend and was great for the occasion"
"8","Wore this to a semi-formal wedding and it was just perfect!","The material was quite thick which was nice for being on the ocean and for smoothing coverage as well as when it got cooler at night, but if it had been any hotter it would have been too much.","Fit true to size.","Wore it with 4 inch wedges and it was the perfect length."
"8","I rented this dress in both a 0 and a 2 and ended up going with the 0, and it was still a little bit big for me around the waist.","It would have been perfect to cinch with a belt, but I couldn't find one in such short notice.","Probably the most comfortable dress I've ever worn.","The lacy detail around the sleeves were my favorite part, and the pockets were also very helpful while dancing at the wedding.","I would highly recommend this dress if you want to be comfortable, and not worry about it being too short."
"10","I wore the with jeans to my son's toddler bday party on the weekend, and also wore it to work with a black flare mini and boots.","It is a stylish, versatile piece.","I liked that the sweater was fitted and was not too long/hit at hipbones."
"10","This dress fit perfectly, and the ruched sides covered any imperfections.","Really lovely dress."
"10","I wore this for a wedding shower and it was perfect.","It was a great length, the bust fit great, the sleeves weren't too tight.","i loved it.","I ended up going with the medium since it fit better and i think i would have had some trouble zipping up the small.","I had my daughter with me and the times i had to squat down to put her in her car seat i had to be cautious not to flash anyone, but you can avoid that situation pretty easily.","between the top and the skirt there is a thick seem, but for me it was fine.","for others that have a thicker torso it might be tight.","got lots of complements!"
"8","This dress is gorgeous and really accentuates all your features!","With that being said, it does show imperfections in your tummy area, but not as bluntly as other tight fitting dresses.","I will say one of the only issues I had was continually having to adjust the dress around my chest (with it being a strapless) because the lining kept show and slipping down.","Other than that, it was a phenomenal choice and I am VERY happy with it!"
"4","Huge on top and super tight in the waist"
"10","Great dress!","super comfortable.","M fit but too snug for my liking.","Hem hit right above knee.","Would rent again !"
"10","This jacket is perfect.","It's a neutral color that goes with everything.","Has great details... zippers, pockets, and belt which make it more than just a regular leather jacket.","It's snug, but that's the way it's meant to be worn.","I felt it fit very true to size.","I would have love to kept it longer, but the weather got much too cold!"
"8","Overall, I was pleased with my choice in this dress.","I certainly received compliments on it, and the color was fun.","(It looks pretty pink here because of the lighting, but it's more purple).","The only frustrating thing was that there was no way to wear a bra with it, and unless you have a full enough chest, the top will swallow you.","So I had to buy those sticky implants that actually worked really well to fill out the dress nicely and give me a little more support.","Other than that, no complaints.","Loved the pockets!","And it was a truly high quality dress in terms of the material and the cut."
"6","It was way to short, I wasn't able to wear it"
"10","The side zipper was being difficult due to the band, but don't give up, it'll go."
"10","This dress is not my typical style (I normally wear something fitted all over for formal events), but I kept going back to this one for whatever reason for a fall wedding I had coming up.","It did not disappoint.","I fluctuate between a 2 and 4 depending on the brand so got both sizes and went with the 2.","The differences between the two were very subtle, I just preferred the smaller size since it was more fitted up top and I liked where the skirt fell lengthwise.","It ran pretty true to size, but I thought the skirt fell longer than it appeared in the photo (and I'm 5 foot 6 so I normally don't have issues with length), but I didn't think it took away from the look at all.","It was super comfortable which is high on my list, it was really fun to dance in, and was very unique in comparison to other guests at the winter wedding I wore it to.","It's a great rental - you won't regret it!"
"8","Cotton jersey knit material.","Comfortable and flattering, I dressed it down with a jacket and booties."
"10","I rented this for work.","I wanted a transitional piece that would work for the cold mornings, but also something I wouldn't be dying in during  the afternoon when it warmed up.","This dress was perfect!","The material was light but the coverage of the dress balanced it out.","The fit was super flattering, I felt so thin.","I got compliments on it all day long, I wish I kept it longer!","!"
"10","This dress definitely runs a little large - especially since it's more of a loose style so I would suggest sizing down.","It also runs a bit short, so if you are taller or have longer legs like me it definitely will not hit the ground.","The material is incredibly soft and the pattern looks like stripes in photos but is more like a watercolor painting - received lots of compliments on this one."
"10","It fit me perfectly and everyone complimented me!"
"10","Fit: Not so tight that it shows your lumps, not too loose that it makes you lumpy.","Material: Substantial and luxe.","Sizing: I'm 5'3 and the 4R fit perfect with Halogen slip-ons."
"10","This dress fit great, but it did ride up as I walked.","I didn't let it get me down, because it looked so great.","We were off to a concert that night, but stopped off for an impromptu renewal of our vows with Elvis - this dress was so fun and just added to the tone of our evening."
"10","I liked this one more than I thought I would!","I was afraid it would be short, but it was fine for work.","The material was nicer than I expected.","Really cute print and love the asymmetrical cut."
"10","The length was perfect, it all fit very true to size."
"10","The dress was a little tight across the chest but I am on the busty side.","The details are beautiful and so is the material and color.","I would def rent it again.","My only regret is not getting any good photos."
"8","Runs a little large and long, I am 5'7 and 130 lbs and this was a tad too big and long.","Overall still a great dress for work.","Material is pretty thick so would be great for spring, fall."
"10","This dress is absolutely gorgeous and has an extremely flattering fit.","The navy color is beautiful and the off the shoulder style makes it really special.","Absolutely love."
"10","The dress fit perfect.","I decided to order a size up because of the type of dress and also because I am more curvy; it was a good thing I did.","The dress was very comfortable and the sequins did not irritate my skin.","I wore this dress to the marine corp ball and for my engagement pictures; received compliments all night long.","Would definitely order this dress again !"
"10","This dress is extremely flattering and comfortable!","I love the unique design and how simple it is.","This runs true to size and we recommend sizing up for your backup.","This is great for any cup size and the fabric is stretchy.","This should be worn with a strapless bra.","Pair this with a gold cuff or bracelet!"
"10","I am a true size 4 in Badgley Mischka dresses, and this was no different.","I am 5'3 and wore 4 inch heels and the regular length was perfect.","I am not overly busty, but I couldn't wear a bra with this dress because it would have been too tight.","Not wearing a bra was not a problem since the fabric was thick enough and ruched.","However, if you have a larger chest, I would order up a size.","It was very flattering (especially for someone with a booty.)","I would definitely recommend!"
"10","LOVED IT!","Stretch fit.","Thick fabric help keep everything where it should be!"
"10","Want want want It's such a thick cable, soft and great to wear"
"6","This was perfect for an office party.","I really liked how big (very big) the skirt was.","It was classy and fun.","If you are anything more than a C cup, order a size bigger than 2.","My boobs just barely fit."
"8","I was wavering between true to size and large.","The fabric is stretchy and it probably runs a bit big, but I wouldn't have ordered down a size.","I think if I had ordered a two, it would have been tight in the bust.","The extra fabric wasn't unflattering and if anything, made it comfortable.","Nicely made dress."
"10","I wore this dress at a rehearsal dinner for a formal wedding.","I LOVED it!","The color is kind of a neon yellow/green in person.","Kind of like a tennis ball.","Surprisingly pretty for such a weird color.","The neckline adds a little interest to a simple, clean, but still flirty look.","I got so many compliments.","Also, it fits like other Elizabeth and James dresses, which is tight and non-stretchy but generally true to size.","If you have bigger than a mid-sized bust, you're gonna want to size up."
"8","This dress is gorgeous, but the front is VERY low cut.","No bra can be worn with it the way it is.","But a few pins here and there fixed it right up!"
"8","Comfortable, beautiful lace.","The first I dress received was damaged (big hole in lace on back) but excellent customer service - they overnighted a pristine dress in correct size to my hotel.","Got lots of compliments!"
"10","The dress fit well - both the 8 and 10.","I went with the larger size as it looked a little better.","The scuba material is great.","The dress was incredibly comfortable and super flattering.","Fun to dance in for a wedding.","Fit a larger bust well.","I felt very put together and the painted floral print felt special."
"10","Cant wait to wear this for 4th of July - it is a litle big but the straps are adjustable.","It is a faltering top actually!","Covers your arms the perfect amount."
"10","I normally wear a 4, but ended up wearing the 2.","I am 5'8 and 126 lbs and 34D.","The 4 was too big thru the hips.","The zipper was impossible to zip--but I found that if I put it on backwards and then turned it around, it worked!"
"10","Lovely dress for a summer vacation.","Felt elegant and the material was thick enough to be able to wear any type of undergarments.","The only downside was the middle button over my chest would come undone sometimes, but still one of my favorite dresses rented from RTR"
"10","I rented this to wear for my daughter's baptism.","It's a great dress since you can wear a regular bra with it.","The a-line made it very easy to camouflage a lower belly pooch and wider hips.","I loved how I looked in it so much I bought it!","It's my favorite date-night dress."
"10","Warm, comfortable, stylish, and so far looks good with everything.","I LOVE this jacket.","I am usually a medium, and a small is perfect for me, so order a size down."
"10","This dress was the perfect fit for a wedding, the dress code of which was Formal or Fabulous.","I got compliments on it throughout the evening.","It was comfortable enough to dance the night away, though some of the sequins near the arms rubbed unpleasantly against my skin.","Considering it was all sequins, that's to be expected.","Overall, a great experience."
"8","I wasn't so sure about this dress when I first tried it on - but I got a ton of compliments.","It fit easily - and was small bump friendly (I'm pregnant and just starting to show).","The sequins were quite scratchy under the arms.","I also ended up having to safety pin to show a little less cleavage.","This would be a great dress for NYE or a holiday party."
"10","Incredibly comfortable and really flattering.","Wore it to brunch on vacation.","Highly recommend."
"10","Loved this dress!","Received compliments on it all night and felt great.","When I rented they only had the long left so I just hemmed it with hem tape since I was wearing Toms.","Only problem was that the zipper was extremely difficult to get up and down where the middle section comes together in the back.","My fiancé had to use pliers and even then it took a lot of work.","It was a little tight in the chest area (I'm a 36DD) but not too bad.","Sad to see this dress go back!"
"10","I am 5'2 so the pants were full length, not cropped for me.","The fabric was incredible comfortable and the fit was very flattering."
"10","I wore this dress for a sorority sister's wedding and I couldn't have felt better!","It runs a little big in the chest, but fit the rest of me like a glove.","I danced the night away feeling perfectly divine!"
"8","The top was a bit roomy for me as a 36 D with a shorter torso.","A friend help me tie the straps together in the back to form a racer back.","It looked just as good and kept the ladies in the dress.","I had to size up for my chest so the skirt was voluminous and the waist very roomy on me, but my chest just wouldn't fit in the 10L."
"8","Probably could have gone a size up.","The dress is really tight in the bust area, took 3 people to zip it."
"10","You’ll need double sided fashion tape to keep the girls in.","The 2 fit okay, but I should have went a size smaller.","The dress is pretty thick and kept me warm throughout the night."
"10","Very comfortable fit, but the fabric was a tad itchy."
"10","This was a nice dress, elegant yet sexy.","I ordered the small and medium, but the small fit me perfectly (I usually buy a size medium, 6 or 8).","I wore a NuBra sticky bra and it worked fine.","The front did expose more than I like, but it wasn't that bad since i'm only a 34B, any bigger and it would have been cleavage central.","The length was perfect for a wedding, i'm 5'3 so it covered my knees.","The open back was nice, and no one at the wedding had a dress like mine.","Very happy with this rental, I was iffy at first, but i'm glad I did it."
"10","This dress is definitely on the smaller size so wild recommend sizing up.","I needed help with the zipper and realized I would never be able to go to the restroom on my own!","It's a beautiful dress and will be ordering again when the size up becomes available."
"8","I loved the pattern and soft blush color, but was a little nervous that the blush would appear white under certain lighting, as I was a guest at a wedding.","I think the color is fine in person, but the dress does look white in some of the photos from the event.","I loved how light and airy the dress was, but the arm holes made me have a bit of an underarm roll depending on my arm position/posture-- which I was fairly self-conscious about.","The lining wrinkled quickly (it was a very hot day), but you couldn't tell because of the flare of the skirt.","The dress was perfect for dancing, and the rental process was SO smooth.","I would definitely use Rent the Runway again."
"10","I usually wear a size 4 but I felt this dress ran a little tight...so the size 6 was perfect and comfortable.","This was my first RTR experience and I will definitely do it again.","The cut out on the sides make the dress super sexy, without being too revealing."
"6","The dress is absolutely gorgeous, unfortunately the dress proportions were off for my height.","I would have loved to wear this out, but I couldn't because the lengths were awkward on my body."
"10","Hey you!","Stop looking.","You've found the dress you're looking for.","This is tops!","Quality matches price!","About me: I am 5'8' and 141 lbs.","I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs.","RE: FIT/STRETCH.","Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size.","So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6.","Whereas, if you're a 4/6 girl and you've been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you'll be able to wear the 4.","I ordered both!","I was worried I wouldn't be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.","I was worried that the sleeves wouldn't fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!","RE: LENGTH/SEXINESS.","I felt that the dress was appropriately long.","By today's trends, most gals would say it's way too long.","And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman.","However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it's illusion top and glittery burnt rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).","From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale.","The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn't mind one bit.","If that's a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match.","RE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring.","My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps."
"8","The dress was classy, I wore it to a formal lunch event, and it fit great.","However, the shoulders/sleeves (whatever you want to call it) were awkward to me at first.","It's kind of off-the-shoulder, but not completely... anyway, it was fine but I was self-conscious about keeping the straps at exactly the right level (otherwise the material stretches in an unflattering way) so I wouldn't rent it again if you plan on dancing or moving around a lot.","If you just need to sit and look pretty then it'll probably be fine.","Other wise the dress was really pretty and I received a lot of compliments.","One last thing; I am busty, and I was able to wear a strapless bra, but I had to be aware of the dress slipping down at times and exposing the bra on the side.","Not a deal-breaker, but it wasn't a worry-free style for me."
"10","This dress was perfect and true to size.","Usually I'm between an 8 and a 10 depending on the cut of the dress, but since this one flared out at the hips the 8 was perfect.","The material was gorgeous and comfortable and I could wear a normal bra so I consider this really easy to wear."
"10","I go so many complements on this dress the whole night.","It was a formal event but there was a lot of dancing involved.","The fact that the dress is actually so short kept me from becoming a hot mess while still looking elegant.","It's slim fitting, so be ready to suck it in with any size you get.","It's a long dress and it would have been dragging if I didn't have heels on."
"10","Very comfortable.","Stretchy in the bottom and fit well in the top."
"8","Sweater material will stretch out especially if you're seated for a while.","By the end of the night it lost most of its shape and hung like a loose bag.","If you're planning to spend most of the event standing it will fit like a glove and be super comfortable."
"10","I ended up wearing a different option from Rent the Runway since this dress was a little too formal for the wedding I was attending.","However, I absolutely loved this dress.","It is elegant and unique.","It is form fitting but the best part is that the material has a little stretch so it conforms to your body for an exact fit.","The material is high quality and the beading detail is intricate.","I highly recommend this dress for a black tie event."
"10","The dress fit perfectly and looked absoultely great!!","I got so many compliments on the dress.","I hope it comes in other colors!!","I went with the 2 and it was a perfect fit and very flattering on!","Highly recomend this dress."
"10","The lace cut-out details were really cool and the fabric gives this dress a sophisticated, edgy feel!","Lots of compliments all night and no extra jewelry required!","The dress speaks for itself!"
"10","I would recommend ordering your normal size then one size down as a backup."
"10","Great dress.","I'm 5'2 109lbs but i'm very athletic which made the xs, which is the size i would normally wear, too tight in the arms.","Also as a mom i thought the Small provided a little more length.","Runs really short i think.","Dress is comfortable and easy to move in.","Also pretty warm.","overall, i got tons of compliments and had lots of fun in it."
"10","I wore this to my senior prom and honestly, I never felt more beautiful!","The dress was pretty true to size and there were no problems with the way it fit.","It was a bit long on me and I wish that I had gotten the petite, but it was my bad because I miscalculated how high my heels were going to be.","I received A LOT of complements and I couldn't have been ANY happier!!!!!!!!!","!"
"10","An AMAZING dress.","Seriously, pictures don't do it justice.","The lace is subtle but super sexy--the back is so, so great.","Fits like a glove!","My date was drooling all night.","Only caveats: it rode up a little sometimes, but I got used to it, and the extra hem bit by the middle lace section would sometimes show.","Nothing that would stop me from renting this dress a million times more!","The fabric was pretty thick, but if you're sensitive to nip slip, definitely plan on getting some sort of strapless backless something or other."
"10","Great quality of fabric, fit like a glove.","Slit in front was a pleasant surprise.","2L was indeed quite long but I was wearing 5 or 6 inch heels, so it worked perfectly."
"6","This dress is simple and classy, but it came down to my knees.","I thought it would have been shorter.","It was nice just not what I was hoping for."
"10","The bust was a little too big on me, but I fixed it with cleavage cupcake inserts.","The length was perfect for the 4-5 heels I had in mind.","Aside from the bust, it wore like it was tailored for me.","Loved this dress."
"10","I was not able to wear it before sending back but it was SO sophisticated & chic.","I can't wait to rent again.","It was fitted but not skin tight and would have looked great with a pair of skinny jeans , pencil skirt or straight black pants."
"10","Lovely lace, pockets, and great fit!"
"8","I loved the dress - it was think enough to keep me warm at a Washington fall wedding, but it moved and was very comfortable.","I do have to say, although I felt really good in the dress, I didn't like the way I looked in the pictures.","I wore a size 2, but looking back on the pictures taken of me that night, it looked like I gained 20 lbs.","I probably should have gone down another size, because I felt subconscious about my cleavage all night and the flare of the dress made my bottom half look a little too big for my liking.","Otherwise, I really did like it and I would get it again, just maybe a smaller size."
"10","It was comfortable, It looked great and I couldn't be happier with my experience"
"6","This dress was comfortable and true to size.","Only con was that my boobs run on the smaller side so I had to wear a padded bra and even still there was a little too much room in the chest area.","Also was a little longer than I expected"
"10","I typically wear a 6 in dresses.","I am a 34D, 29 waist, and 41 hips.","So for girls with hips, this dress is perfect.","I rented the 6 and 4 (per other reviewers recommendations) and I am glad I did because I wore the 4.","The 6 fit and I could have worn it... but when I tried on the 4 just in case I instantly felt it fit me better.","My only problem was I felt the empire cut under the breasts didn't allow much room for busty women.","But I was able to squeeze my D's in there and not worry about them falling out.","The material was lovely and packed well for my trip from Dallas to Seattle for the wedding (no wrinkles!).","And the color was PERFECT for a Fall wedding.","I got lots of compliments and felt very pretty!"
"10","Pros- Classy, great linesCons - slightly fitted"
"10","It was great!"
"10","It was nice to have a petite option.","The dress was snug in all the right places."
"10","I liked this dress a lot.","It was comfortable and cute.","I am short, 5'1, so it was a bit long on me, hitting below my calf but I don't mind a longer dress.","* I wear a bigger size so being short and a bigger size makes most dresses long, so it may be the right length for someone else*   I thought the size was good, I may have been able to do the 1x but I didn't have time to retry that (I ordered the 2x and 3x).","There was a little gaping in the back where it zips but nothing too terrible and wearing a small sweater over it helped.","I liked where it hit at the waist and had kind of a bell shape to the skirt, so it was flattering and I didn't have to suck in my tummy.","I would rent this dress again."
"10","This dress is really beautiful and the details are stunning.","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and got tons of compliments.","The dress runs small, and the fabric has no give.","I'd definitely recommend going a size or 2 up.","I typically wear a size 2 and wore the size 6.","There is one big but here though - the slip included with the dress is tiny!","If you have any sort of curves or hips, the slip doesn't even cover your butt.","I think it's supposed to hit about mid to upper thigh!","I had to buy my own slip to wear underneath because the dress is see through."
"10","I ordered this for my sister, who is 16, to wear to our holiday cocktail party and it looked phenomenal on her!","The 2 fit perfectly and she received a ton of compliments.","The back is gorgeous (it dips a little) and it was not too short.","We loved it!"
"10","I rented this for a unique situation at a military ball.","Since my husband is deployed, his unit was invited but the ladies were asked to wear cocktail dresses instead of a ball gown.","I wanted something comfortable that I could dance in but not look out of place with all the formals and this was perfect!","No shapewear necessary and bra friendly!","It does run very big.","I am normally a 10/12 in most items I rent because I am hourglass shaped but I was a perfect 8 in this- could have gotten away with a 6!","Length was great.","Got compliments all night, I would definitely rent again!"
"10","Fit great, was definitely form fitting, but was comfortable and looked great."
"10","I rented this to wear on a girls weekend in Vegas.","My daughter invited me to go along with her and her younger(20 something 30 something) friends.","Had delivered to the RTR Vegas Store.","Only size 10 was available and I was concerned as I have gained some extra weight recently.","The 10 fit beautifully (thanks to Spanxs)  This dress was everything I could want    simple sleek  sophisticated.","The navy was a bit different then black.","The cape is was made this dress.","I wore red  heels, rhinestone pins on the shoulder, cubic zerconica earrings and a statement ring.","The younger women said the dress was hot and like it.","I fit in with them and their  mini dresses..","I know what I should wear  and this is an examble"
"8","Perfect with black stockings for a work Christmas party.","Classy and sophisticated, yet super sexy since it was just a little on the short side.","I squeezed into the size 2 - which was a little tight around my rear and hips - but didn't regret it for a second.","The size 4 would have been more comfortable, no doubt, but this dress looks best when it fits like a second skin.","It wasn't the easiest dress to dance in, admittedly, because it doesn't have any give.","But it looked so great I didn't even care."
"8","Very flattering, very comfortable, received numerous compliments.","Biggest drawback is that it's a hard to lift your arms above your head.","The 4 came with a built in bra, the 6 did not."
"8","I loved this dress and hated to return it!","I wear a 36C bra and did not need to wear anything under it because of the built in bra.","Train was a little tricky to walk in, but I highly recommend this beautiful dress!"
"10","Wow.","I'm a 4 on a regular basis; I can sometimes wear a 2 in premium designers.","The size 6...I could barely get into.","Luckily I have tiny arms because the lace does NOT stretch.","The dress fit like a glove, but didn't allow for a lot of comfort unless standing up (which was worth it).","I went braless because there was absolutely no room for additional material.","I would definitely order two sizes up."
"10","I LOVE this jacket.","I really didn't want to send it back.","I even tracked it down online for cheaper than RTR is selling it and sent the link to my husband as a Christmas present idea.","It drapes perfectly, is warm, and very flattering.","I wore it everywhere - concerts, work, grocery shopping - and the pockets are large enough to fit my giant phone!"
"10","I am 5'8 and I wanted the 0L based on reviews, but it was already rented.","I went with the 2L for the ceremony and felt kind of blah...the dress was too big and didn't compliment my figure at all.","I switched to the 0R for the reception and am SO HAPPY I did!","It was formfitting but still incredibly tasteful and flattering.","I wore 3 inch heels and was overall happy with the length.","I do think the 0L would have been the perfect size for 5'8 and above.","I'd recommending having a backup in R or L (whatever you don't select initially) if you're close to this height as it could go either way!"
"10","Fit like a glove.","Loved the open back and high neckline.","Received compliments throughout the night."
"10","This dress was worn for my anniversary dinner!","I was a little apprehensive about the lace on this dress since usually it can be unforgiving and uncomfortable, but the lining on this little number made it great!","I'm a short girl, about 4'10 and the slit came up pretty high, but that wasn't an issue for me as I covered my lap with a napkin once seated at dinner.","The cut is low, but not too low.","I have a larger bust, 36D, and with a little strap adjustment, my girls sat in there nicely.","The only downfall to the low neckline is a little spillage for those larger busts when you're sitting down- still not enough to be an issue.","I would rent this again and again!"
"10","Nice material, flattering with a little attitude."
"4","Loved the look of this dress on the hanger, but it is definitely not for women with bigger hips.","The flouncy bottom pulled a bit and just didn't look right on my frame."
"10","Fit was true to size.","I'm 5'9 and the size 6 worked great.","The colors were bright and perfect for a party, lots of compliments!"
"8","I wore this beautiful dress to a golf outing at a prestigious country club as an appearance with my husband.","I love golfing in dresses because it gives you that polished look with out being stuffed into too hot shorts (the shoes are hot enough)  I am normally a medium, but per recommendations, I sized down to a small and it still fit very loose.","I tied the bow around the back of the dress because I did not like how the dropped hem looked with the bow in the front.","I have a pretty big bottom and hips, but this dress did a great job of dressing them up.","I also stayed cool in this material for eight hours on the course!"
"10","Fit slightly small around arm holes."
"10","Material is very forgiving, as is the cut of this dress.","It's really cute.","Comfortable."
"8","These pictures do not show the color accurately This dress is more red-orange than orange.","It was roomy through the body which hid my imperfections.","It was a smidge to short for my preference for work, but looked cute with talk boots.","It was an awesome look for dinner."
"10","Comfortable and so cute that it transitions perfectly from day to an evening of pub crawling in New Orleans."
"10","Dress was fairly true to size.","I am typically a small in most dresses and the 4 was good.","I ordered a 6 as my backup as reviews said it ran small, but I actually would have preferred a 2 as my backup.","The was a small wrinkle up near the chest area that might have fit better in the 2.","It was fitted and tight, but not so tight that I felt like I needed spanx.","I got many compliments throughout the night and someone even told me I should buy it because it was so great on me!","Definitely rent this one!"
"10","I loved this dress.","It cinched perfectly in the waist and had some very nice detailing on the bust and waist.","It even has pockets!","The dress is low cut, so expect to wear it without a bra.","It holds you in though, so it should work out perfectly.","It's a plain navy, so I wore it with over the top earrings and a necklace."
"10","I usually wear an 8 and I am SO glad I sized down for my back up and ordered a 6 because the 8 was like a pillow case on me.","I wore a sticky backless bra just to eliminate the risk of showing any straps, but you could wear a standard bra as well.","I like that the top was fitted and the skirt was more flowy--great for dancing (and eating lots of cake).","I received lots of compliments which is always nice :) I would highly recommend for any spring/summer occasion!"
"10","This dress is LOVELY.","I rented it for a hip yet formal fall wedding.","Two of our closest friends were getting married, and my husband was asked to officiate.","In order to play “Preacher’s Wife” I feel like I had to step up my game.","After dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh.","Enter RTR and this lil beauty.","PROS: GORGEOUS detail.","Lace for days.","Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business.","Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail.","Love the two pintucks on the front.","Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling.","Tons of compliments!","Looks pretty with pearls as well.","AWESOME to dance in.","Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.","CONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum.","The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked.","I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top.","The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out!","HMM: There’s a bustier / inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!","I’m still giving this thing a 5/5 because I loved my RTR experience and I see this dress in my dreams.","We already miss each other.","Come back to me, Shoshanna dress."
"10","I love this sweater.","I normally wear a large but I sized down to make it a bit more of a crop.","The green color is beautiful and it has green metallic thread going throughout the sweater which make it great for the holidays!","I will rent again!"
"10","The dress does run small (as do other ML dresses), but was a great fit once I was in the correct size.","It was a great dress if you plan on dancing because there is a lot of freedom to move in it.","The color is more green in person and was gorgeous.","I would also worn complicated necklaces tended to get caught on the lace, so keep it simple up top with the accessories.","I received great feedback and felt wonderful in the dress.."
"10","The dress fits great, and I felt very comfortably in it all night!","The lacy back was very figure flattering and my friends loved it!","!"
"6","Had to return the dress.","I have a closet full of size 12 gowns as we do a fair amount of formal events.","Had checked the size chart before renting and thought I'd be more than safe in a 12 as I've even recently lost weight.","Was excited when the gown arrived only to put it on and not be able to zip up the back.","I had purchased a size 10 White House Black Market evening gown and it fit the same as this gown.","Not sure how others felt the sizing was but I even checked the inside of the dress to make sure I hadn't accidently been sent a 10.","Gorgeous gown, well made, heavy.... just didn't fit true to size."
"10","Could have ordered the Medium - the small was a little tight in the chest but it was form fitting and short which was perfect for the occasion!","Great party dress- simple but fun!"
"10","The fit is very good.","The sleeve openings are a little low, so I had to be careful in photo poses not to show too much weird armpit area.","I was also surprised how heavy it, but that makes the flow of the dress spectacular."
"10","I got a size 6 as a backup but never even tried it on.","The 4 fit perfectly.","The dress is indeed long, and I agree with other reviewers that it's great for tall ladies.","I don't think I've ever received so many compliments from strangers.","The lace is thick enough that your undergarment choice makes no difference, but I was still comfortable on a hot day.","I wore a strapless bra.","The skirt is bit constricting because of the length, but I could still walk, dance, and sit without much problem.","I loved wearing this dress and would highly recommend it."
"10","Very fitted and high quality material.","Love how the pockets and waist are constructed.","Thicker material so wouldn't recommend for warm weather.","I wore a simple chain necklace and it was perfect but you could do bolder jewelry if you wanted.","As others mentioned it is difficult to get on when going to the bathroom, but I managed fine."
"10","It fit well.","The 10 was tight around my hips so I went for the 12 which fit much better."
"8","It felt a little big in the bust, but because it is a flowy material it didn't have too much impact on the overall fit.","I really liked the length.","I'm very tall so I can never find things that are a good length but this would probably be floor-length for a female of average height."
"2","The dress was much shorter than it appeared, too short for a wedding, so I wasn't able to wear it.","Other reviews about the lace being a little tight on the shoulders is spot-on, but it would have been fine if the dress had been a little longer.","Bummer, too, because it is such a pretty dress."
"8","I am normally a 4, but always size up with rompers.","The 6 fit perfectly.","It was very flattering.","My only complaint is that the lace on the arms was a bit itchy."
"6","This was my backup dress and I didn't need to wear it.","The color is amazing in person.","A 10 would have been better for me- it was very large through the belly (and I have a bit of a belly!).","I wanted a purple dress, but this was probably too casual for my formal fundraiser."
"8","The dress runs big overall so order a size down."
"8","I'm 5'8 and wore a three inch heel, I ordered the regular only because the longer length wasn't available, but since there was a bit of a train in the back the length wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.","Just enough so you could see my shoes in the front, and hit the floor in the back.","I was able to wear a normal strapless bra with the dress that didn't show in the back.","Dress in all lace so be careful with any bracelets that might catch the fabric.","I felt confident and beautiful all night, and received so many compliments all night long."
"10","The Large wasn't as tight as the medium, and felt more comfortable in the large.","I think this dress is beautiful and would definitely wear again!"
"10","this is a fun dress- it's very regal looking.","The blue color is so bright and pretty, it will definitely catch some eyes.","I got lots of compliments.","it's also pretty comfortable.","I didn't wear a bra even though I have a C cup chest, and it was okay because of the conservative shape of the front/top.","I love the way the dress flows."
"10","This is one of my favorite gowns on the site.","It fits amazingly and gives off a romantic, effortless vibe.","The light dusty pink is perfect for a late spring or summer black-tie event.","It runs true to size, but definitely size up for backup.","The bust runs a bit small and is perfect without a bra or with a NuBra, Luckily the fabric has some stretch, which is helpful with fit!","I would highly recommend renting this gown.","Style it with statement earrings!"
"8","super short, but super fun.","I had to wear it with leggings because even slightly raising my arms revealed a little too much, but it was still really cute.","I actually liked the shoulder pads, lending a little more structure to a dress that could look really heavy... it's A LOT of sequins.","But the most fun sequins I've ever experienced-- the ability to flip the color from matte black to shiny silver is brilliant.","Be prepared for lots of hands all over you."
"8","How I wore it: black long sleeve crew neck bodysuit, slim black velvet chocker, small hoop earrings, nude pointy toe pumps, sleek ponytail.","Fit:  a bit larger than I would've liked:  I wanted it to hug my body like a pencil skirt but it was a little looser than that:  I think that is due to the material.","Pros:  Nice way to add a little holiday sparkle into your wardrobe without being overly obvious.","Modest length good for work.","The double vented back was a nice surpriseCons:  Just wished the material would have had a little more spandex to it to hug the body"
"8","The only con is that the Zipper is a bit funky, so even though the dress was lose, it was difficult to put on.","But it was comfortable, flowed well and was easy to wear."
"8","This is a cute dress and much warmer than expected.","It does run large and I noticed this expecially in the shoulders.","The sleeves are also long, but I'm tall and it didn't bother me.","This is dark navy and I wore it with brown boots.","Practice tying the bow beforehand.","Overall, cute for work."
"10","This dress is my favorite dress I have rented so far!","The lace was beautiful and the colors really popped!","Wore true to size, I wore the size 8.","Rented for my birthday, but will be renting again for a bridal shower!","May even consider buying this dress!","Does ride up a little when you sit."
"10","I wore this for a casual outdoor wedding reception.","It was a beautiful dress!","It was so comfortable and fit very well.","I wore mine with flat sandals and it was the perfect length.","I do recommend being prepared with something for the static of the dress.","The skirt will not lay right unless you use something for the static.","Other than that, this was a great dress!"
"10","I rented this dress for my company's holiday party and got many compliments from everyone!","Like all the other reviews, this dress does run a little long.","I am 5'6 and got a 4R and had 4 inch heels on and it still kind of dragged on the floor.","The bust area is a little more roomy than other dresses, but thats what a push up bra is for!","Pair it with a statement necklace, some bracelets (and add on a fur coat for the winter), and you got a fabulous outfit!"
"8","This was the perfect dress to wear as a bridesmaid in my friends wedding.","It's got a nice classic cut, but the low V and mid-thigh length also feels very sexy and fun.","I paired with deep plum pumps and some fun rhinestone earrings.","Runs true to size.","Definitely better for smaller chest sizes due to the deep V, but if you got em flaunt em."
"10"," This is my 2nd time renting from RTR and I was not disappointed!","I wore this dress to my sorority's 25th year anniversary gala and received lots of compliments!","I am usually a size 8, but I tired on the 6R first and it fit perfect!","I was afraid my 3 inch heels would make the dress too long, but the dress fell just perfect below the shoes!","I wore a racer back bra and there's lot of flow through the hips so no spanx needed!","The color is darker than on the model, but still gorgeous in person!","I paired the dress with nude heels and a gold colored necklace.I would definitely recommend this dress!"
"10","I am 5'1 so I had to wear 5 inch heels.","I wore the 4R and it fit well considering that I am curvier in the hip area.","I would recommend this dress!I saw this dress on a friend of mine and she mentioned that she got this from RTR.","This was the first time renting a dress for a wedding and absolutely loved the fit and the feel."
"8","This dress was bright and cheerful.","The colors are actually more vibrant than pictured.","But it was too large for me.","I was disappointed."
"6","I wore this to the office.","Because I am petite and the cut-outs on the front are low, I had to wear a black cami underneath and it was visible all day.","I didn't have a strapless bra that worked with it.","Otherwise, it was fun to wear and I did get some compliments."
"10","The dress runs big.","Go down a size for your backup.","I rented it in blue a few weeks ago and loved it, but the red was even better."
"8","A little baggy in the bust (thus the runs large) and watch that the back zipper stays fully zipped.","Nice silhouette, feminine but streamlined."
"8","The dress is very pretty and looks great with a jacket.","The fabric is thicker than I thought it would be making it well suited for fall/winter."
"10","I loved wearing this!","I wore it for a Valentines Day dinner.","It was so comfortable and beautiful, and the material was really soft.","It was a little difficult to get the zipper down in the back, but it didn't ruin the overall impression that I had of the romper.","Such a good rental!"
"10","I loved this dress.","While I usually wear a 6, I wore the 8 in this because the illusion sleeves are somewhat tight on the arms/shoulders and I wanted the freedom to dance.","It was extremely comfortable, I barely had to adjust it all night.","It was light but well made, voluminous but not puffy, elegant but also fun!","It was a great length for me, but with low shoes it might be a tripping hazard.","The pattern appears more grey-black-purple in person.","I would wear it again in every color if I could."
"10","The dress had a lot of stretch so it made it  very comfortable.","The length was a little weird though because it was short when I put it on with heels.","I still loved it though.","The 6 long would have been perfect, but I didn't have that size.","Bust area was a little revealing for me, but it was fine."
"10","The top was a little looser than I would have liked, but there is a rubbery lining that helped keep it in place.","Thicker material, might have been a little warm for a wedding in July - but GREAT color."
"4","this was not flattering on my curves.","Didn't leave the wardrobe!","!"
"10","This dress was so much fun.","Perfect for a classy formal with the low back--not too sexy, but not too boring either!","I am pretty curvy and it was super flattering.","I ordered the 4R and 6R--the 4R fit better overall but I ended up wearing the 6R because the arms were a little snug in the 4R.","I would rent and wear this dress again!"
"2","So I didn't get a backup of this dress because it looked online like I would be charged extra for the backup.","This was small enough that I couldn't zip it up and it was unwearable."
"10","Loved the dress and it was perfect for a Gatsby themed party.","The long was perfect length with 2 heels and I loved the back."
"10","This sweater is comfy and very warm.","Perfect for the 20 degree weather I wore it in.","Great for everyday or dress it up for a date."
"8","Rented S but runs larger, rather loose fit.","Perfect to match with skinny jeans as it also runs a bit long.","My piece arrived like new, good quality.","Love the cute patterns too."
"10","I am not someone who usually chooses form fitting dresses , however when I tried this on at the Georgetown salon, I couldn't say no!!","It is the most flattering dress, in the most FANTASTIC color.","I ended up wearing the size 8R (though I'm usually 6R) and it fit perfectly - I cannot emphasize enough how flattering this dress is, it hugs in all the right places but then the lining helps skim over any anxiety-areas.","N.b.","there's no way to wear a bra or spanx (the side cuts are quite wide), however that really wasn't a problem as the fabric is strong enough to hold everything together.","Overall, 10/10 - I wish I could have bought it!"
"10","The dress fit absolutely perfectly."
"6","This dress was picked by RTR and provided to me as a substitute alternate choice for my second gown selection.","(I needed two different dresses for my multi-day event, and my first choice was not able to be rented to me due to its condition upon return from the previous renter.)","It is very beautiful, the fabric is quite thick and the train in the back gives it a solid feel.","The fabric also flows quite nicely when you walk.","I was pleased when I received it.","I was happy that the petite length worked for me with a 2 heel, but I was ultimately unable to wear the dress due to the bodice.","I am very large busted and have to be able to wear either a full bra or at least a strapless bra.","This dress has an open back.","I tried to wear sticky bra supports but they did not stay on and therefore did not work for me.","I could not wear this dress comfortably without a bra.","I would have had to wear this dress on stage and did not feel confident I presented properly with no breast support by going braless.","It is not conducive to braless wear for large busted women.","Unless you want your bra strap to show across your back or your breasts to hang down to your waist (without a bra), this is not the dress for you."
"8","Dress fit true to size.","I loved the design just wished the ruffles and pleats were higher.","The extra fabric hung by my hips and butt.","I got several compliments and I was very comfortable all night."
"10","This dress was perfect for a late fall wedding.","I got a TON of compliments.","The fit was perfect, the color was perfect, length was perfect (a tad on the short side, but felt it was fine because of the long sleeves).","Loved, loved, loved it!","Would rent again."
"10","It was  very good - felt very slimming.","Definitely had to go for the bigger size tho!"
"10","I've had  my eye on this dress for almost a year now.","A few of my friends have rented it for weddings and formal events, so I was a bit nervous to copy them.","The original dress I ordered was unable to ship so RTR sent a 2R and 4R as a replacement.","Boy, I am glad this was available.","I'm 5'2 120 lbs - I'd say I'm closer to pear shape then straight up and down.","In terms of length and fit around the waist I could have gone with either the 2 or the 4 ,  but the selves were falling off me when I tried on the 4 so I went with the 2.","Great fabric a bit heavier than I thought it would be.","I'd definitely rent this again."
"10","I can't get over how much I absolutely adored this dress.","It was beautiful, the sparkles made it fancy, while the length kept it casual.","It was comfortable, I could wear a regular bra and there were pockets!","It fit great, enough room where I needed it and not too big where I wanted to hug my curves.","It was flirty without being overly sexy, the neckline was perfect.","It was a show stopper, people at the wedding gave me compliments and people stopped me on the street to tell me how much they loved it.","It was the perfect dress and I was a little sad to send it back!","I would rent this dress 20 more times!"
"8","I'm not sure if I kept the dresses in the bag too long but when I took them out both dresses were very wrinkled.","I hung the one I wore from both ends in my bathroom by a hot shower running (for awhile) and that seemed to solve the problem.","The strap up top could've been a little tighter but it wasn't noticeable and the smaller size was too small.","I did love the back and thought it was worth the small issues I dealt with.","I also felt very comfortable in the material.","I was glad I rented the bigger jewelry I did because it helped with the front of the dress.","As another reviewer pointed out for her, the front did not do much for me.","Overall, I'm glad I picked the dress and would recommend because of the back and classic look."
"10","This top was really comfortable to wear to work with unique detailing and comfortable feel.","Wore it with black pants and a cardigan, but also removed the cardigan and work and felt that the top was appropriate.","As is evident, it doesn't flatter the midsection but flows well and looks nice."
"8","The dress fit like a glove - I wore the 6, and had the 4 as a back-up.","I can wear anything from a size 2-4-6.","I'd say the dress runs on the smaller side, so if you're in doubt about which way to go, go up a size."
"10","It can be a little short although it has shorts.","But really cute with the sleeve rolled up."
"10","This dress fit perfectly.","No issue in the hip area.","It was a little snug in the waist but not terrible - the top fit perfectly and I am a 36DD.","Really pretty in person and just a fun dress to wear!","!"
"10","Flattering fit, comfortable, great color"
"8","I wish I had the long but it still covered my shoes."
"10","The dress fit like a glove.","Ordered a 4 and 6...both fit but went with the larger size.","Fabric is thick so it's very forgiving and flattering.","Easy to put on, no zippers...just step into it!"
"8","Comfy, cute, and classic.","I would recommend."
"6","I tried this dress on at the showroom at Henri Bendel, and after not finding anything I loved, I chose this as my last resort.","When the dress arrived, it fit great, however it ended up being a little TOO sparkly for my event.","The wedding was black tie casual, however I was a guest of my boyfriends, and felt it would have drawn too much attention.","I would DEFINITELY rent this for a New Years Eve, or holiday cocktail party, it would be perfect for that type of occasion, especially if you do not like to draw lots of attention!","Fit great, low cut V-neck and nicely fit throughout hips, waist etc."
"10","I wore this dress to my School of Pharmacy Centennial Gala.","It definitely stood out, and I received so many compliments from colleagues and strangers.","Many commented that it was their favorite dress of the evening.","The dress was in excellent condition, and the color was gorgeous.","The back was my favorite part.","I usually wear a size 2, but the 0 fit like a glove.","Plenty of room and hugs every curve!","I loved this dress and would recommend it to anyone!"
"6","I was not able to wear it because the size which fit had a 6 inch opening in the leg seam-the previous wearer had clearly pulled a thread-but it was not fixed before it was sent to me.","I had to scramble to find a dress the day of the event.","I was seriously disappointed.","The stylist who responded to me was prompt and professional, she said I'd receive a full refund when they receive everything back.","It was a truly beautiful dress........bummed I couldn't wear it, but I did wear the jewelry I picked."
"4","boxy and weird.","oversized in shoulders even though i have broad shoulders, and tight in chest.","not great for woman with curves."
"8","I wore this dress for my schools winter gala, and it was amazing!","Like others said, the straps were long."
"8","The dress was snug but in a good way!","I received tons of compliments the whole evening!","I typically wear size 0  and this size 0 was quite snug.","Since I am so petite (only 5' 0) the dress hit below my knees.","After ordering this dress, it got me hooked on Rent the Runway!","All my friends asked me how it worked, and I was delighted to tell them the details!"
"10","My back-up size for the original dress that I choose was not available, so they sent me this dress as a backup.","If I didn't love the first dress so much, this would have been a beautiful alternative.","It fit so well and hid my stomach (which is post baby).","I will definitely be renting this dress in the future if I have somewhere dressy to go!"
"10","The dress was beautiful and flattering.","My boyfriend LOVED it as did everyone else- i received compliments from everyone from my friends to the bridal party to random other people.","One of my guy friends told me that people approached HIM commenting on how gorgeous my dress was.","I paired it with nude pumps and a nude shawl.","My backup size was a 10 and I wish I had sized down to a 6 instead, the 8 looked fine (my normal size) but I would have liked to see how it looked a little tighter."
"10","The dress is just gorgeous.","I love the fit of this dress.","I received many compliments."
"8","A little long but perfect fit"
"10","What a fantastic dress for a great price!","One little thing, it tends to catch on things because of the beading.","Would definelty rent this dress again:)"
"8","This dress was so comfortable and slim fitting..","I absolutely loved it!","Fits true to size, easy to wear with a strapless bra.","The only problem I had was the second layer kept riding up but I made it work!"
"8","Just be sure you have an appropriate bra for the low back."
"10","This dress fit perfectly.","I am usually a 4P, and this dress fit true to size.","I am 5'2 and wore 4.5 inch heels, and the dress barely brushed my toes in the front.","The color was unmistakable, and I was the only one wearing red at the wedding, which made this an unforgettable dress!","It was very comfortable to dance in.","This dress fit snugly in the bust, waist, and hips.","As I get a tad bloated after eating/drinking, this dress did show this by the end of the night.","So I would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly.","I did not wear a bra nor spanx with the dress, as the material is very sensitive in the rear, and would have shown the spanx outline, so I decided to take them off.","There is built in wiring/lining in the waist and bust.","Customer service was extremely helpful.","My first choice dress was damaged, so I could choose another dress, and when that one did not fit, they overnighted me this dress."
"10","All previous reviews said it ran long, so even though I'm 5'9 I got a 4R because I planning on wearing low heels.","it fit perfectly.","really nice thick material"
"8","interesting pattern, easy to wear"
"8","The dress was a perfect fit!","The only small issue that I had was the sequins scratched under my arm after being in the dress for a long time and dancing all night."
"8","I rented the skirt portion to wear for a White Shirt Day at my company's Conference.","The goal was to style your white shirt to reflect you.","I got so many compliments on this!","The fit was a little tight so I had to wear the Size 4 - didn't even try on the Size 2.","Perfect for accentuating tiny waists - but Curvy bottoms beware - I had to shimmy over my bum carefully so the zipper wouldn't rip - but was all good once I got it over."
"10","I wore this to Disneyworld, and it was perfect!","Lightweight and forgiving, but most of all happy!","I will definitely rent this again this spring."
"10","I normally wear a 6, but the 6 was squishing my chest.","Overall, this dress is great and I got tons of compliments.","It did take two of my girlfriends to zip me up and my underarms were a bit sore for a few days from the sequins, but I already knew this from reading all the other reviews.","I wore dark gold accessories and a regular bra."
"10","I loved, loved, loved this dress!","It made me feel sexy, and my boyfriend loved it.","I rented it for my birthday party, and the looks and the compliments in the restaurant were endless throughout the night.","It's definitely short (even on someone my height), so taller ladies should be aware of that.","The shoulder detail adds to the appeal of the dress, too - highly recommended!"
"10","I rented this dress and the same dress in blue previously and love them.","It is a little snug in the arms but the fabric has some stretch, so it was just fine.","The color is vibrant and you can wear a regular bra with the dress.","Definitely would rent again!"
"8","Loved it!","Wore it to a baby shower"
"6","The top was too loose - baggy at the waist, long in the arms, and boatneck too wide."
"8","comfortable, great fit."
"10","The fabric is thicker that makes it warm and stretchy.","Which was perfect for a chilly night.","It was a great length (right above my knees) .","The bodice hugged my upper body and then perfectly opened up just enough.","It was a great dress that made me look amazing and was perfect for drinking cocktails at the bar."
"10","Absolutely loved this dress.","The color is unique, but understated.","The material of the dress is scuba suit ish and very flattering.","The neckline is super sexy and classy.","Love it."
"10","This dress was gorgeous.","I wore it to a rehearsal dinner and loved it!","I got so many compliments.","The beading on the top is beautiful and the fabric is very flattering and forgiving.","I vary in dress size, especially ones that are tight around my ribcage (which is where I am biggest)).","I ordered a 6 and 8 and ended up wearing the 8."
"10","This is a really cute dress, but boy does it run small in the chest even for Saloni.","I wasn't even close to being able to zip the 4 up and I usually wear a 2 or a 4.","So if you are busty or have a large rib cage, size up!"
"10","Dress is slightly stretchy so its comfortable.","It hugs your curves well and the lace looks beautiful.","I got many compliments on the dress.","The chest is a bit tight so I did not need to wear a bra and not sure there is room for a bra anyway.","It is the perfect dress for a cocktail party in the fall.","It looks great with black heels and some black tights.","This is the second time I have rented it and would rent it again!"
"10","I wore this for a black tie winter wedding, in Vail,CO.","iEveryone complimented me on this dress all night.","It was so easy to wear.","Super comfortable.","so fun to dance in!","It is a gorgeous red color too!","I am very glad I got the 6.","It is my true size and fit perfectly..","I wore short heels and it was perfect length... Had I worn my 4-5 heels, i would have needed the 6 long.","(i am almost 5'8)"
"8","I should preface this by stating that my review is very much based on my real girl body -- so if you are in shape, then this dress, like most dresses, will look great on you.","For me, it did not do wonders.","I'm a stereotypical apple and did not find this flattering at all.","The only pro from that perspective, to me, was the fact that the top was cut in such a way that it hid the chub where my arm and body meet.","All of that said, the fabric is pretty."
"8","There were some times that I didn't like the cut out, but still wasn't that bad."
"6","Maybe I've gained weight?","I think the wide straps were not flattering.","I didn't feel confident.","Maybe this is better for someone with wider hips and a skinnier waist.","Or perhaps someone who is just rail thin?"
"8","Slightly on the short side (and I am only 5').","Comfortable stretch."
"10","I wore this to a teacher banquet, and absolutely loved it!","It does run small- even though I usually wear an 8 I sized up so it wouldn't be as form fitting for this occasion.","It was almost too tight .","It did fit especially small in the chest area.","If you don't want really fitted you may want to consider sizing up 1 or even 2 sizes.","Having said all that, I got so many compliments, and the lines are so flattering.","I loved the crisp white with the black lace contrast.","My husband loved this dress.","I will rent again, just this time I will up two sizes to a 12."
"8","comfortable"
"8","This is a beautiful dress.","Details are immaculate.","Fit is a bit small, especially in the arm holes.","I'm 5'4 and it hit me at the knee, which added to the matronly-ness in my opinion.","I prefer a midi or mid-thigh length personally l"
"10","Wore this on a date with my boy friend who was not super jazzed about seeing a RTR bag arrive at our apt for an ordinary Saturday night while we are trying to save to buy a house!","Knew it was a winner when even he admitted  the dress was great.","Was cute with black stockings and booties for a wintery evening."
"8","I received several compliments.","Love where it hits on the leg.","A little tight in the arms.","I usually wear a 6 but wore backup 8."
"10","It was very comfortable, easy to wear dress.","The only delta I can give it is that it wrinkles fairly quickly - but I didn't mind because the wedding was on a farm."
"8","I am 5'11 and I ordered a Long, however I had to wear flats because it was so much shorter than I thought it would be.","Also this dress fit me much lower cut in the bust than the pictures I saw of the other girls reviews.","Great dress and the sparkle was perfect for New Years, got a ton of complements which makes a new mom feel great!!","!"
"10","I fit into the 4 but it was snug and I prefer room to move, so I wore the 6.","It was great, I danced the night away, helped the bride change and never felt constricted.","The fabric was soft and light, perfect for a hot and humid day!"
"10","I'm typically berween a 20 and a 22, and being 5'8 with a longer torso, I usually need a Tall size in orser to get a good fit.","The 22T fit me perfectly and even left a little room for a small heel (which is rare for me.)","I'm very busty and I was concerned that it wouldn't contain the girls but it fit nicely in the bust.","A sexy neckline and I didn't feel like I was going to fall out of it.","My only knocks on this dress are the crappy zipper and the broken/bent sequins.","I had to have someone help me in and out of the dress because the zipper was so stubborn, even though I had plenty of room for it to zip.","I found a fee bent or broken sequins throughout the night as they were catching on anything woven, including my shawl and my friends dresses.","I paired the dress with silvery/sparkly jewelry and added a metallic red purse and lipstick for a pop of color.","I received a ton of compliments both during the party and when I went into the office the next day."
"8","I rented this dress in the lighter pink color last year and loved it, so I tried out this color for another wedding.","Because this is a darker dress, it feels a little more formal than the light pink, but they are both great for cocktail parties/weddings/etc.","Loved the pockets and structured fit, particularly for a full figure.","The only downside is the lack of any stretch, which is why I went with my larger backup size."
"10","This dress is GORGEOUS.","It was perfect for my vision of Old Hollywood glam/Great Gatsby style for my recent engagement photos.","The sequins are not overly gaudy - they seem the shimmer in the light!","And the slit on the side is sexy but not too high.","As others have mentioned, it is a big snug in the midsection, and runs a bit short.","I ordered the 0L and 2L, and ended up wearing the 0L.","I'm only about 5'5, but with my 4 inch heels, the regular would have been too short.","The long worked perfectly!","The midsection was a little tight, which is why I wanted the size 2 as a backup.","The bust, however, is a big large for someone with a small chest, like me.","I would have worn the 2L had the bust not been big on me.","My advise is order a size up as backup, but if you are small in the bust, you may end up sticking with your usual size.","It really is a lovely dress, and I highly recommend renting it!"
"6","I rented this dress thinking I would wear it to work but it looked a little too well worn and had an overused look that I didn't like.","The dress puckered in the rear where the zipper ended and didn't lay flat which would have caused me to tug and pull the dress down periodically so I decided not to wear it and returned it instead."
"10","I thought this dress would be textured since it was called pebbles but is really this beautiful lace instead.","Was surprised but a great dress and very pretty.","Sexy although covered."
"10","This dress is so flattering and beautifully made.","I wore this to a wine dinner fundraiser at an upscale restaurant.","The embroidery on the dress looks hand done and is so rich in color.","I wore with fuchsia suede pumps and minimal jewelry because of the metallic thread, just earrings.","You have to wear a strapless bra.","The hips were snug, but the waist was loose.","Fit perfectly on top."
"10","I ordered both size 4 and 6.","Normally I am a 5 so I can go either way depending on the designer.","I am glad I went with the 4 as the 6 fit but it was a tad bit loose.","I wore this to a wedding and got a lot of compliments as to how beautiful and elegant I looked in this dress."
"10","This romper is perfect for summer!","It is very true to size, stretchy, and lightweight.","I would recommend wearing a strapless bra and wearing the romper off the shoulders.","If you're not comfortable with that, this romper still looks great wearing it on your shoulders.","There is plenty of stretch and this was so comfortable to wear."
"10","I rented this dress last minute for a black tie event in the city.","I am normally a size 4 but since I decided to rent so last minute the size 4 was not available.","I ended up getting a 6R which was a little big over the hips and in the arms but it wasn't too noticeable and quite frankly it was really nice to not have a super tight dress when you have to sit down for a 3 hour dinner and award show.","The length of the dress was a little short for me as I was wearing 4 heels with a 1 platform so if I would rent this dress again I would go for a 4L in size.","Overall I'm really happy with the dress and would recommend it for any formal affair such as a winter gala, wedding, holiday party etc."
"10","This dress fit beautifully !!!!","Very high quality fabric and construction.","I will definitely use RTR again."
"10",":)"
"4","I did not wear this dress because the size I ordered (4L) did not fit correctly.","I have a larger chest (32DD) and the strap did not seem to look appropriate.","I think this dress would be very pretty for a petite build (I'm more athletic)."
"8","I normally wear Petite clothing because I am short (5').","The dress showed my bra at the arm holes and gaped - I wore a simple white jacket with it and it solved the trick.","Loved the quality construction and the hue was subtle and not garish.","Rented  necklace that had spring colors and paired well."
"10","I wore this dress for 238th Marine Corps Birthday Ball in Santa Fe, NM.","I fell in love with this gown the minute I opened the box.","It is gorgeous, true to size and very comfortable.","I received a lot of compliments trough out the night and turned a few heads as I was walking the hall ways!","this dress fit the occasion perfectly!","I will definitely  be renting RTR again!"
"10","Perfect fit, so comfortable.","I wore a strapless bra and you couldn't see the lines through the dress.","Many compliments and it fit to size."
"8","I'm 5'4 and a busty, so I ended up wearing my back up size (4R).","Unfortunately, it was a little too long even with 4 heels, so if you're short I would recommend ordering a petite.","Other than that, the dress fit beautifully, and I would definitely use rent the runway again!"
"8","I wore this to dinner and a show.","It was so comfortable.","Definitely runs big."
"8","Top a bit big as I'm slightly short waisted.","The sequins under the arms may be a bit much if you wear for a while.","And top reveals a bit too much cleavage for me.","Didn't get to wear to event as it was canceled due to weather so I don't have 'wearing' experience, just wishful trying on!","Would rent again."
"10","LOVED it and got tons of compliments.","I was pleasantly surprised that its kind of a sweetheart neckline instead of straight across.","This was a new herve rental for RTR so it was in perfect condition and not stretched out at all.","I usually wear XS for herve rentals but sized up for the size S this time, it was just more flattering and comfy."
"8","This dress fit beautifully for the most part - I'd say it ran pretty true to size.","I am normally a 4, and the 4R fit right through the bodice.","The only negative was the long length - I am 5'6 and even with 3-inch heels the dress was a bit long.","I had to be careful not to step on it throughout the night.","I did wear a nude strapless bra with the dress.","There is not lining under the lace details, but the back strap of the bra was barely visible through the lace.","I loved the colors of this dress - the navy was classic, but the aqua provided a pop of contrast/fun.","The even was a black-tie optional wedding.","This dress was formal, but the sleeveless and sheer skirt details made it a bit more casual than a formal gown - perfect for a spring wedding."
"8","I wore this dress for a family member's wedding/anniversary celebration.","The dress fit true to size as it said.","It hit just above the knee for me with the length.","It was a little snug around the waist area, but still easy to move around and dance in!","The sleeves fit well but became a little tight as you raise your arms up.","Overall, the color is amazing and perfect for a fall or winter wedding/formal affair and comfortable to wear  thru out the day.","I would rent this dress again!"
"10","Great dress!","I wore this as a bridesmaid in my sister's June, Texas wedding and got a TON of compliments.","I wore a NuBra with it - though I probably didn't need to - and used fashion tape to keep the shoulders in place.","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone considering it."
"8","I found the dress mostly true to size.","For a size 12, which I felt more comfortable in, the bust area was a bit tight.","I found a strapless minimizer bra that fit well and did not leave me tugging and pulling.","For the chestier ladies I wouldhighly recommend it with this dress.","I did get compliments and felt the sparkle for a  Saturday night formal wedding."
"10","Runs true to size and the fabric is thick enough to hide any flaws."
"10","The fit was very small.","If i did it again I would get a bigger size, but other than that the material is amazing and unique."
"10","I am petite and this dress fit perfectly.","It hit above the knee, so it was work appropriate.","However, I also wore it to a weekend event.","One of my favorites."
"10","This dress fit great and was a flattering little black dress.","It was very low-cut and fitted, but worked perfectly for a girl's night out on the town.","I could have worn either the S or XS, but went with the XS for a more tight fitting look.","The fabric did not have much stretch though so arms were a bit tight and I was unable to wear a bra due to the cut of the front but the fabric was thick enough to be supportive.","Overall a very fun dress-- I would definitely rent again!"
"8","Depending on the dress I can wear a 6 or a 12, this makes RTR difficult.","I wish I ordered the 6 for this dress although the 8 worked well enough.","It could have used a steamer, but I still felt beautiful."
"10","This dress perfectly, true to size!","It is made out of a thick material so you don't have to wear a bra with it if you don't want to.","The color photographs beautifully and the length was just right!","Sad I couldn't keep this dress in my closet."
"10","Beautiful dress for a beautiful wedding!","I received so many compliments all night.","The fit is very flattering.","I just had a baby that left my lower midsection with a slight pooch and this dress provided just enough flow to hide it.","I also didn't need to wear a bra as the top of the dress is fitted with a bit of  a stretch.","I was completely comfortable all night in this dress.","My only hangup is the color is not as pink as pictured, which I kind of expected after reading other reviews, but it was still a nice light blush color.","RTR is my go-to for all events now."
"10","I'm 5'4 and can't wear most RTR trousers because they are too long.","On me, these were ankle length rather than calf length--perfect!","The flare is just right.","The fabric is stretchy and thick, so it smooths and it does not wrinkle.","These traveled well in a suitcase."
"8","I still can't put my finger on what I didn't live up to my expectations about this dress.","The color is lovely and the texture is unique, and the fit was mostly great.","The boning in the torso was uncomfortable as the night went on, but that was my only fit issue - I didn't even have to wear a bra, which was a nice surprise because that just doesn't happen for me with 32DDs.","I think I was thrown off by the high-low skirt, which isn't my favorite cut, but I thought it worked for this style.","Maybe I wanted the skirt to be a little fuller?","It sort of looked like it was hanging there.","Overall, it was a fun summer dress, and I'm glad I tried it."
"10","I felt like a queen in this dress.","It's pretty perfect.","The back is so flattering, the front gives a little peek but not too much, with the lace center.","It was the perfect length for me in 4 heels (for reference, I'm 5'4).","True to size."
"10","Loved the fabric, it makes the fit very flattering!","I usually wear a size 6 or 8, I think these European sizes run small.","It is a little heavy so perfect for fall or winter event.","I was comfortable all night!","Great dress to dance in!","My husband was happy too!"
"10","Obsessed with this romper!","Perfect for summer.","This runs true to size and there is only some stretch within the waist - I would size up for your backup.","There is comfortable room in the bust.","Because it is an off the shoulder outfit, a strapless bra should be worn with this.","The midsection is fitted but there is a decent amount of room in the hips.","This romper is definitely short - it comes to about 10+ inches above the knee.","I would pair this with wedges or sandals and fun statement earrings!"
"10","The dress was great!","It fit perfectly and looked beautiful in low light.","A little bright during the day but still great overall.","The small train in the back have it the extra glam it needed and I received many compliments all night.","The only con I have is that the sequins did rub under my arms.","This was my first experience with Rent the Runway and it went off without a hitch...","I'll be back for sure!","!"
"10","Can't go wrong with a Badgley Mischka gown!","I love the muted tone of this gown and the open back adds an amazing twist to the conservative front.","While it was very form fitting throughout, it did fit true to size, although  I recommend going up a size in your back up - especially if you have fuller hips.","I chose to not wear a bra with this gown because of the open back, but you could definitely use a seamless adhesive bra or silicone coverups for extra comfort and concealment.","The length was perfect on me with 3 inch heels but if you are taller than 5'7 and plan on wearing heels I recommend going with the long length!"
"8","The romper was just too baggy to wear."
"10","The 4 fit better in the chest but it was too loose in the waist but the 2 fit perfectly in the waist"
"10","Loved the dress.","A little short in the front for me (i'm 5'7), much too short if I lifted my arms, but I wore it with tights and that was perfect.","As many people mentioned the dress stains easily when wet (even with water).","I found simply using a blow dryer and a towel I could manage to get the water stain to disappear.","Highly recommend especially for a winter event!"
"10","I loved wearing this dress out for a fun girls night out in Napa.","I was super concerned that it would be to short in the torso which normally happens to me and rompers but that wasn't the case with this one!","I am 5'7 and have a very long torso so keep that in mind if you are on the fence.","It made me feel great and was made out of a wonderful fabric that gave a bit of stretch but not to much.","Can't recommend this piece enough!"
"10","This dress was extremely comfortable and was so pretty!","I would definitely rent/wear this again.","Don't mind the sushi baby I have going on in this picture."
"10","Loved this dress and got so many compliments.","Only complaint was that the neck line was pretty tight when you sat down but would otherwise rent again!"
"10","Big, go down 1 size for perfect fit"
"6","I always get compliments when I wear RTR dresses, but not with this one for some reason....the pockets stuck out; I should've taped them down.","I thought this was a smart, sharp looking dress, but it wasn't my best."
"8","Fit TTS.","Very form fitting but surprisingly comfortable.","I was initially underwhelmed with this dress as it seemed more business appropriate rather than formal wear but was able to dress it up with shoes and statement earrings.","I ended up being very pleased with how it turned out."
"6","Dress was more pinkish than the picture.","I wore it as a bridesmaid dress.","I am a b-cup so I had to pin the cleavage area up.","Other than that it was very comfortable."
"10","The fit was great.","It was snug but by no means uncomfortable.","Both the 2 and 4 fit great but I ended up going with the 2.","It is a thick material which really helps the dress lay very flat and smooth.","I had strangers approach me all night long about the dress!","I do wish I had ordered a long as it was a little bit off the floor.","I am 5'5 and had 2-3 inch heels."
"10","This dress is classy sexy!","I wore this for my 50th birthday black tie affair...I felt so glamorous.","It fit snug but in all the right places.","The construction is such that it held everything in place beautifully including not needing a bra which is a big deal for me.","If you are larger in the bust be comfortable showing cleavage!","I loved how it kicked when I walked.","So for size reference I am 5'4, wore 3 in heels and length was perfect.","I weigh 126 and am a 32DDD, the boning kept me in place just fine.","The lace allows for some smooth shape wear if needed.","It's stretchy so it was very comfortable...although I didn't eat much a few days prior!"
"10","This is a very comfortable and flattering piece for a petite person.","Styling and great quality.","In great shape but it appears I was the first to wear.","The pants were well lined and top had structure.","Down side:  pants wrinkle very easily and it's difficult to get out of without help so take  a friend to the bathroom."
"10","Fit really well."
"10","This dress is just gorgeous!","The colors the fi,t everything screams glamour!","It is form fitting but comfortable and thick enough to hide my love handles.","I usually wear size 12 on evening gowns and the XL was perfect.","I have broad shoulders and narrow hips but thanks to the stretch of the material it fit perfectly!!","!"
"10","I wore this to a gala that I attended with my coworkers.","It was a fun twist on the LBD.","Loved that the fabric was heavy enough to wear it without a bra!"
"8","This dress fits like a glove, and the fabric is thick enough that it doens't show bumps etc!","I thought it was super flattering and really comfortable.","It is a great way stand out in a sea of black dresses.","I paired it with Black wedges and a creme pashmina for an outdoor late summer wedding"
"8","This dress works for everything.","I drove a long road trip and still got there looking cute.","It is comfortable and you can dress it up or down.","It is a little short for people that might be taller than me.","Love this for everyday."
"10","Amazing dress!!","Fit true to size, comfy, & was sexy yet classy!!","I got so many compliments all night!","Totally recommend this dress...definitely a MUST!!",":)"
"10","Body hugging, but surprisingly thick material.","It is pretty short, but the neckline evens out the dress so it's not overly revealing."
"10","The ONLY downside was that the dress was so long and my heels kept getting caught in the lace.","I'm 5'9 and ordered a regular length, yet it was still too long for me.","Otherwise, perfect."
"10","The top has give to it, but structured.","It was easy to go without bra.","Perfect length (56 with 2 inch heels).","There are two layers of non very breathable fabric, so wouldn't recommend for hot weather.","Other than that, very comfortable.","I ended up wearing the sleeves up on the shoulder for some more arm coverage, and it looks pretty both ways."
"8","Generally speaking, I love just about everything I put on by Kate Spade.","This dress was pretty adorable, but I personally didn't love the pattern; it looks amazing in the stock photo and the mid-section hits her just right, but it wasn't as pronounced when I wore it and I missed that!","Overall, still a great dress and it was my fiance's favorite of the three dresses I rented this time around.",":)"
"10","Loved this dress.","It was a heavier fabric than I thought but the quality was excellent.","Loved the fit and the feel of the fabric.","Good length for work, and the darts made the fit seem like something out of Mad Men.","Think Joan and pair it with a big pearl necklace and a padded bra."
"8","This DvF piece is stunning.","I wore it on-air for a public affairs show and have been approached so many times since - not because of the interview, but because of this jumpsuit!","The tailoring and the color made me feel truly regal.","Plus you can wear it as a professional look or for going out.","My only gripe (which is why there are four stars and not five) is that it's low cut.","Like, crazy low cut.","So low cut that I don't know how anyone wears it without pinning it or double sided tape.","My tape actually started to give right before the interview, so I had to pull the back up with a hair tie at last minute.","It totally worked and I felt very Fashion MacGyver, but would have been much easier if they simply put a clasp on the front."
"10","Yes"
"10","I am normally a 2 in dresses.","This one was too tight at the top of the bodice.","I am reordering in a 4...should work great!","It's a beautiful dress!"
"10","high quality fabric"
"10","Pockets are a great extra and the lace design overlay.","Very pretty and lots of compliments!"
"8","I liked this - I have never worn a jumpsuit before so it was really fun wearing NICE pants to a formal event.","However, the bust part of the outfit was a little interesting.","Mine gaped (I guess I don't have enough to fill it out properly) and so I had to use a safety pin to pin it closed all night.","I didn't love that but wanted to wear the outfit so dealt with it.","Also, and this is just a function of all jumpsuits probably - but peeing is HARD.","You have to take off the entire outfit!","So remember that if you are renting this for an occasion where you might drink a lot.",":)"
"8","Much more formal looking with the gold embroidery than I thought.","It fit true to size.","Even though there was no stretch it did not feel tight at all.","A dress for any season!"
"10","I would definitely recommend renting this dress.","The dress fits true to size.","Looks great on!"
"8","It’s flowy and body skimming and perfect!","I went home to check the price to buy and that’s a little out of my reach right now.","I got so many compliments (I teach at a high school).","I wore it with a cardigan since it was thin straps.","The straps on the under dress are a little too long for me, so if there was a “short” size I bet it would be perfect.","The under dress straps drooped all day, but the cardigan hid it.","I’ll be wearing this again this weekend to a graduation party."
"10","This is a great dress.","Really well made.","Definitely a heavier material that is best for fall/winter.","The colored under panel is subtle but still adds a fun pop of color.","Dress was comfortable and there is stretch in the skirt material.","The only thing that was weird is the zipper ran long on the inside of the dress and poked out a little bit making for a weird bump on my butt."
"8","Super cute.","Loved this Romper, even though we couldn't find the belt for it.","It worked perfectly without it.","Ran a little big in the stomach area, so this can work if you have a small baby bump.","The V neck isn't too much with larger busts.","Must wear."
"10","I wore this to a Mardi Gras themed party and it was a total hit.","The lace sleeves are the most forgiving I've ever worn without being baggy.","I'm tall so I'm glad I ordered a size up from what I normally wear because the shorts were definitely short.","This was my first ever romper and I have no regrets."
"10","I have a large chest (34DD) so I was worried about this top having a snap-closure down the front.","However, it stayed in place all day with no issues.","It is extremely flattering with the peplum shape and the print is even more beautiful in person.","Would rent again!"
"10","The dress fit like a glove.","Thick material that fit well.","I am a size 2 and the fit was true to size.","The zipper was a different color on the 4 so beware."
"10","This dress is not subtle.","It fits like a scuba suit.","Super tight with no zipper/buttons.","I found it really flattering."
"8","I wore this for a black tie event and got lots of compliments.","I normally don't have to wear long dresses being 5'6'', but after reading everyone's review I'm glad i got the long.","It fit perfectly.","I will admit that the beading and sequins look a little cheap up close, but from far away it looks great, and photographs great too.","This was my first RTR experience and I will defintely do it again!","Too easy."
"10","This dress felt amazing on.","The fabric was soft, the color was gorgeous and it fit well.","The only issue I had with it is that I wore a 0R with 4-inch heels, and the dress was still a little too long.","I probably should have ordered a petite size."
"10"," I am on the curvier side through the hips and butt.","This dress had plenty of give to accommodate that.","Would definitely recommend and would definitely rent again."
"10","Nice form fitting, you can go without a bra if you so choose, however I used gel cups to keep everything in place.","You need help with the 4 clasp at the neck line so make sure you have extra hands available"
"10","the dress is so beautiful !","im a plus size lady im a size 18, 42dd .","my weight is very even out tho.","the 16L fit perfectly.","only thing is i ordered a long and should have gotten a regular.","but other then the length i was the bell of the ball.","i will be renting here again.","if ur plus size this is the dress for you its very flattering and u can wear a reg bra.","just put some spanks on and youre good to go.","thank you RTR"
"8","Nice material made it feel slimming while also forgiving.","It looked fancy but not too fancy for a company holiday party, and would have been just as appropriate for a nice dinner out."
"10","Fit true to size.","I wore a black cami under the shirt, as low cut.","Loved the button detail and the black stitching detail.","Material had a high end feel, and really nice with a pair of black slacks."
"10","The dress does run large, but I loved it that way.","For those who prefer waist definition, a belt is a must--but I love the column look, so I went without.","The colors in this dress are what make it special, along with the fact that it's crazy comfortable!","I'll probably rent it again.",":)"
"10","Went with another dress, but wish I had another affair to wear this too!","Bright color but not neon or overwhelming.","Probably should've gotten a 2 (normal size) as 0 was tighter around mid section.","Pockets are great.","A fun dress for sure :)"
"8","It fit great, but is probably better for women with a B or C cup.","I was able to wear a low back bra with it to give the girls a boost, but the material is thick enough that you could go without.","The color was a little deeper than pictured, but it was very flattering on my skin tone.","It is very fitted, but stretchy enough to move with you.","Not the best dress for lots of dancing or stairs, but worth it as I felt incredible in it.","I would definitely rent again!"
"10","Great fit - could have gone smaller but they didn't have that size.","Wrap dress makes sizing very flexible.","Perfect length.","Originally rented for Easter, but ended up wearing it to work.","Lots of compliments."
"10","This dress was my fav so far!!","I loved the fit."
"10","I wear this dress for an outdoor wedding.","The fine details of the dress really stand out.","Attention: do wear some shapers...after a couple of drinks the belly stands out..."
"10","This dress is so much cuter than it looks in the picture.","I loved it.","The top gave a bit more cleavage than I needed, though I would rent it again.","The skirt is very flattering and the fabric is nice and thick.","It's very comfortable and since I filled it out on top I didn't have any problem with the strap length."
"10","The dress was perfect for work.","The material is so comfortable, I didn't want to take it off at the end of the day!"
"8","I waffle between a 4 and a 6 in formal dresses, and for this one, although the 4 fit, the 6 was more comfortable and just a hair longer, which made a difference in this dress at my height!","I paired it with nude pumps and a gold necklace.","It's very much a bright pink with fuschia undertones in real life.","If you like shift dresses, this one is a great option!","My only complaints are that the dress was a little bit worn and it was very short."
"8","Loved the style and sheer elements.","Because I'm very curvy, this dress would look trashy at an office party (even a nighttime one), but not for a girls night out in say, Vegas.","I had no bra or shapewear on.","* I plan on reviewing everything I try.","The majority of reviews are usually on the smaller sizes and I'm definitely not those!","My stats: 5' 6, 169 pds, 36-30-42, size 10-12, L bottom, M top."
"8","I wore this dress for a hot day in the city - we had friends coming in and had a mini photo shoot.","This dress is gorgeous and flattering; it looks great in photos!","Major hit - will definitely rent again!"
"10","This dress was even more beautiful in person!","The embroidery is so pretty, and the colors are really nice!","It was a very flattering fit, but honestly my boobs barely squeezed in there.","A small detail that I loved was that the straps were velvet, which was a really nice touch!","I'm typically between sizes 8 and 10, but the 8 fit really well other than the bust!"
"8","This was a fun dress to wear, and I got many compliments.","It's plain material, but I dressed it up with a formal shawl and jewelry.","Make sure you have a sticky bra as there is no way to hide straps.","I had to pin the front as it was a bit too low for my taste."
"10","I rented this as a piece to wear on my birthday weekend for various activities.","I ordered up a size because I'm always worried that things aren't going to fit.","It was definitely on the big side, so its probably true to size.","I liked the skirt and would consider purchasing a similar piece."
"10","This dress is a showstopper!","The high low effect with the light pink lining was absolutely beautiful and it was so comfortable to wear.","It fits true to size, but if you have bigger hips I would recommend sizing up, as the short skirt part of the dress has no stretch to it and is somewhat tight!","I highly recommend this dress for your next formal affair!"
"10","Um, there's cats on this dress.","Also, I couldn't walk five feet without getting a compliment.","Best.","Dress.","Ever.","I miss it every single day and I think I'm going to have to buy it."
"10","Rented and worn for a December wedding.","This dress was beautiful, flattering, AND comfortable.","I got endless compliments.","The best part - it has pockets.","I was so sad to send this dress back!"
"10","I wore this to my a company holiday party in San Diego.","I ordered the 6, it did not come in time so ended up having an 8 overnighted to me.","This dress is definitely short as people have already said but it is so beautiful!","I would have done better in the 6 since I am small up top.","Wearing the 8 was a little bit loose and the sleeves fell down a few times.","But I loved this dress too much to care.","The sequins didnt bother me and it was just enough sparkle for the night.","Definitely recommend!"
"8","It's definitely a cute, fun, and playful type of dress.","I wasn't crazy about the material - it looked and felt different than I'd imagined from the online pictures and reviews.","It had a natural stiffness and poof to it that was unexpected, but it was flirty and fun (but not scandalously short or inappropriate for my friend's wedding!).","The top part was snug in the rib cage area, so I opted to go up a size.","It was nice that you could wear a strapless bra underneath (although I didn't even bother since the dress was snug, secure, and thick enough to go without).","A busty girl might want to avoid this one - I'm small chested and felt it was quite snug.","Overall a cute, fun dress for the evening!"
"10","I had originally ordered another Badgley Mischka dress and it ended up not fitting properly, but thanks to RTR's fantastic customer service they had this dress to me by noon the next day.","This is such a fun, flattering dress and I didn't want to take it off!","The color is even more outstanding in person, compliments all night long :)  I wore the long with approx 3 1/2-4 in.","heels and it still reached the floor.","Paired it with the Ella Carter Ashley necklace and it looked wonderful!"
"10","The only drawback was that I couldn't wear a regular strapless bra with the side cutouts."
"8","The dress was overall pretty much perfect!","However, since I'm really tall, the waist didn't hit at my waist and instead hit at my lower ribs.","You couldn't tell by looking at the dress/me, but by the end of the night my lower ribs felt like they were being suffocated.","If I had gone a size up though it would've been too big.","Got a ton of compliments though and it paired perfectly with black heels, a red lip, and gold clutch!"
"10","I got this for a friend's baby shower.","The material was medium weight and didn't need to be steamed before wearing, and the fit was true to size.","Lovely, bright, fun dress!","For some reason my measurements aren't saving in my profile, so for reference I'm 34-28-34  and the size 6 was great."
"10","For my body, no dress is totally perfect unless I have it tailored, but overall this fit really well.","I'm a 36DD and there was room for the girls in this dress.","Keep mind though -- there is ZERO stretch in the upper portion of the dress.","The slit at the bottom makes it comfortable to move.","As far as the length -- I'm 5'7 and I'm planning on wearing a very low heel -- it's a good length, but I wouldn't mind if it were a tiny bit longer.","If you're my height or taller I would definitely recommend getting the Long!","Overall a beautiful option that I would fully recommend."
"10","Fit was very flattering.","Highlighted my curves but wasn't over the top sexy.","Color was vibrant."
"10","Wore this for a date night, and it was a lot of fun -- something different and sexy without going over the top!","The skirt gets a little tight after eating, and I had to pull it down every so often, but overall a great choice."
"10","Fits perfect, very feminine."
"10","It was comfortable, beautiful, and made well.","The zipper was a little hard to zip up due to the fabric collecting, but it was stunning.","I wore this as the sister-of-the-groom and it was perfect for a fall wedding in New England."
"8","Bright, slightly shiny dress with a great fit.","I did not end up wearing this dress because even for late spring in the Northeast it was too bright for the event but would wear it to a different event.","The neckline is more modest than it looks here, and the length is great.","Pockets are always useful.","The armholes were a little smaller than normal but it wasn't a problem for me.","If anything, it prevented armpit fat from spilling out."
"10","I received the Alice dress as a backup option when my original dress was not available in the size that I ordered.","I ended up not needing it because the smaller size in my first dress worked fine.","However, the Alice dress is adorable, and I would definitely wear it for another occasion.","As others have noted the arms are a bit snug, but they are not so snug that I would avoid the dress altogether.","I like the length and shape of the dress.","I find it flattering and comfortable.","Thank you to RTR for quickly sending another dress so that I had options!"
"10","This dress is a WOW.","It steals the show, sparkling, changing colors with the light in the most elegant way.","When you are on the dance floor in this, you will fill as if you are in a music video!","And you will not need to worry about accessories, fancy updos or crazy shoes, this dress carries the night all by itself.","I am 5' 3 and full-figured on top and the M was perfect (might have been able to rock the S if I had wanted to really grab more attention.)"
"8","It doesn't have much shape to it but somehow it is much cuter and flattering than the other summer dresses without a waist.","It's not transparent and the material is comfortably light."
"8","fit great.","elongated my petite frame."
"10","Dress was super comfy and I LOVE the material!","I ended up wearing the small, although I usually wear Clover Canyon in a medium.","The pattern was so unique and got tons of compliments on the dress!"
"8","I thought the overlay was going to be gold but it is bronze/copper.","Shoes were a challenge."
"8","Chic and classic wrap dress fit.","The material is very sheer and will require a slip.","Easy to dress up or down with the right shoes and assessories.","Be sure to size UP"
"10","This was a backup for a dress that wasn't ready in time.","I have rented it before and love the dress, classy but also sultry.","Wore the size Small"
"10","I usually wear a four but got a two as a backup size.","I could have worn either, but the two was a slightly closer fit.","I wore it for my best friend's rehearsal dinner, and I got a ton of compliments.","It was surprisingly comfortable considering the amount of beading, and I felt like a million bucks.","My dress was starting to show its wear from lost beads over various wearings (there were some strings here and there).","However, it did not impact the look of the dress that much."
"10","Loved this dress -- gorgeous color and so fashionable.","Runs a little large so I would go down a size next time, but I would definitely rent it again."
"10","I wore this dress for my company holiday party.","I had about 20 minutes to get dressed and ready so I threw the dress on and quickly did my hair and i felt great all night.","The dress was easy to wear, very comfy and was perfect for the occasion.","I am still shedding some baby weight and this dress made me feel great (hid the problem areas!)!","I can't thank you enough RTR - I stress so much LESS getting ready for a night out."
"8","Didn't like the way the fabric clung to my hips and midsection.","This dress is for someone with a straight silhouette, not someone with a lot going on in the hip department.","Also felt very casual, like a slip or a nightgown, not like a fancy dress.","You can wear this with a regular bra, and it felt like a true 6 except for the hip business."
"10","nothing to say went wrong!"
"10","The fit is flattering, the dress is so comfortable and the color is beautiful.","I love the dress.","I rented it once for a wedding and the second time for a rehearsal dinner."
"10","This dress ran small, normally I wear a 10 to 12.","After reading the reviews I decided to order the 12 and 14.","I had to go with the 14R due to my broad shoulders and larger chest I am a 38D.","I felt like a million bucks in this dress and received TONS of compliments, even from people who were not at the wedding.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"8","I really liked this dress but I could have gone a size smaller for the bust area.","I pinned the top to reduce the low 'V' and I used fashion tape to ensure the sides didn't expose too much (mostly while dancing).","The long length worked out well with heels, which I usually do not wear given my height."
"8","High-waisted party skirt.","No STRETCH!"
"10","I was 125lbs when I wore this dress.","I find BCBG runs large in their XS/S/M/L sizes and I own another version of this dress (as a maxi dress) in XS, so I knew to order a size down.","Soft, pleated fabric was great to travel with - no wrinkles!"
"10","Dress runs a size or two large, so get your backup a size smaller.","The dress is a great red color and got lots of compliments.","Thick forgiving fabric without being too hot."
"10","I got loads of compliments on this skirt.","Note that there is more gold woven in than it looks like there will be in the phoeo."
"10","This dress was comfortable, flattering, and appropriate.","I loved it and definitely recommend!"
"8","Not my favorite.","The print looks like faded 70's curtains."
"8","The dress is beautiful and great quality material.","I had to use my larger back-up size because it does fit tightly around the hips/stomach.","The 6R fit fine but I felt more comfortable in the 8R as it was less tight around my stomach.","However, going up a size for the hip area meant that the dress was quite loose around the chest.","Regardless, I wore this without a bra and didn't have any problems.","The dress is long, I am 5'6 and wore it with 3.5 inch heels and it was still trailing a little."
"10","I rented the M and S size and went with the M. In fact, I didn't even need to try on the S. The dress is a lightweight but sturdy material.","It fit great in the waist and the length was perfect.","It was a little tight in the chest, and I don't have a huge bust, so I ended up going sans bra.","I got several compliments on the dress and paired it with a chunky silver necklace and white wedge heels.","I would definitely rent again!"
"10","This dress was true to size.","I loved that the fabric is thicker, it kept me warm without being too hot.","I didn't need a coat or shawl and the pockets are added bonus!","I paired it with Ladies who Lunch necklace.","So many compliments!"
"10","Great Dress!"
"8","No bra needed however be careful dancing, may want to use fashion tape.","I would say if you are 5'6 I would recommend ordering the tall if you plan on wearing high heels.","Ran a bit short.","However very comfortable and easy to dance in."
"8","Definitely an offwhite vs. white dress (my fiancee in the second pic is wearing stark white).","However, super comfortable, flattering, and fun to flaunt on the dance floor.","Fabric is good quality and not flimsy, so I wore for an outdoor party and didn't mind when the weather turned chilly.","Would recommend!"
"6","The color and flow of this dress is lovely.","There's zero stretch and if you have a wide rib cage there is no getting it on.","The bust was too big on the 6 so I got the 4 and could not zip it up."
"10","Wore with booties, easy to wear for everyday but polished.","Feminine, modest, and the best part is how it moves when you walk.","Will rent again!"
"10","Worn to an outdoor wedding in Vegas, the dress was comfortable, fun, and age appropriate.","In agreement with other reviews, the most unforgiving area is the ribbon at the waist, no stretch or give whatsoever.","Typically a zero in most dresses, I was glad that I wore the 2.","No bra or chest support necessary, the girls were supported by the tight waist and fitted chest area of the dress."
"8","Not overly comfy (even though baggy) because they are quite tight at the waist but really cute and got lots of compliments."
"8","I wore this to my class reunion.","It really showed off my large bust.","It was fun comfortable, and easy to wear."
"10","This dress was absolute perfection!","It's simple and elegant without being boring and the perfect gown for a wedding or formal affair.","The ruffle split details adds some fun and flirt to the dress.","The color and fit are very flattering.","The  chest area does run small.","I could not wear a bra and ended up wearing pasties.","Received compliments and inquires all night about the gown.","I would highly recommend this Parker gown if you want to stand out from the crowd!"
"10","One of the best I have rented from RTR.","Fit beautifully.","True to size.","Great colors that pop.","Super sexy.","Got a lot of compliments!"
"10","I wore this dress for a Valentine's Day dinner, and it was perfect.","I'm between a 6 and an 8, and wore the 8.","The 6 zipped but was way too tight across the chest.","I don't have a large chest, but I do have somewhat broad shoulders.","The 8 was a perfect fit.","It's a little hard to tell in the photos on the website, but this dress has a lace overlay.","It's very pretty and the sleeve detail looks great on.","I would definitely recommend this dress - it would be great for a wedding!"
"10","Wow, I loved this dress.","I felt so sexy in it.","The slit in the leg opened when I walked; but it wasn't over the top at all.","It fit like a glove.","Not to long for me at all, but I am tall and wore tall heals.","Overall, awesome dress!"
"10","I wore a belt with it it to give it more shape which I highly reccomend"
"10","Loved the color of this dress!","Beautiful cobalt blue that compliments so many skin tones.","It was very flattering, hiding my less than flat midsection.","My only complaint is that it was a little long even with my 5 inch heels, though it wasn't all that bad.","Overall, it's definitely a dress I would rent again!"
"10","Comfortable with room to move and beautiful on!"
"8","I loved this dress!","After reading some reviews about how long the dress was...","I just went with regular length, I do wish I would have gone with the longer length.","I am 5/6 and I wanted to wear heels but the dress was too short, so I had to wear small 2in wedges for the dress to just brush the ground.","Other then that it was perfect.","I loved the quality of the dress and the fit.","So beautiful in person and in photos.","The zipper was a bit hard to zip up but once you get it zipped it stays with no problems."
"10","Thank you to all the ladies who said this dress runs big.","It does!","I normally wear a 4-6 and I ordered a 2 and 4.","I ended up wearing the size 2.","The top is a bit big and the front gathers with extra fabric.","Also the front of the size 2 was longer than the back.","Over all very comfortable and sparky!","The service was excellent!","The dress can clean and ready to wear!","I'll definitely rent from them again!"
"10","Fits great!","I needed a little bandeau underneath to make it work appropriate - MAJOR cleavage.","But perfect for work besides that, or church, or a weekend bridal shower."
"10","Perfect fit!","Runs true to size and is flirty but cute with the cut-out sleeves and fuller cut skirt.","Still short enough to feel a little sassy but professional.","Would certainly rent this again!","Great material as well."
"8","The 6R was long and I had to wear 4 heels.","The 6P would have needed flat or very low shoes."
"8","I had to get your attention...This dress is beautiful.","The fabric is gorgeous.","The pockets are a nice touch.","The translucent panels are fun.","Here's the catch-if you are busty at all, this is probably not the dress for you.","I am ordinarily a size 4 and asked for the 6 as a backup.","It's a good thing I did because I barely got the zipper up on the 4 in the chest.","It fit beautifully everywhere else but absolutely squashed my chest.","I had to wear the 6 and even that was a bit snug in the chest.","Unfortunately it was big everywhere else.","The 6 made my bottom half look much bigger than it did in the 4.","All in all it worked out but it would have been an over the top home run if the top were more proportionate to the bottom.","I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before so I do not feel like it's me.","If you are a B or less this is probably a perfect choice."
"10","Great for work!","Worn with long gold necklace and nude pumps.","Tie the knots well because the knots tend to loosen up throughout the day!"
"8","Beaitufl dress!","Received lots of complitments.","Only downside was that it was a little short.","Could never have worn this with a bare leg."
"8","The dress itself was so pretty on the hanger and on my body; I just loved the way it fit.","Plus, the style of the dress is so flattering that despite my being pretty boxy, gave me a little bit of a shape.","I wore the dress to a wedding, including a catholic church ceremony (I paired it with a cardigan to be conservative), and it fit the occasion perfectly.","I feel like the style of the dress would fit any number of occasions, though.","The color in person is very pretty and I received a lot of compliments on this rental!","My only issue was with the hardware of the dress.","The dress stayed up, for the most part.","There is a silicon strip at the top of the dress to help it stay in place, but the strip on the dress I received was partially worn away so I was tugging it up more often that I think is normal for that dress.","Also, the zipper eye-clasp faced inward, so I had a few scratches on my side from the clasp rubbing against my skin."
"10","Fit true to size.","Hugged my curves.","Kept me warm.","Made me feel sexy and look sexy"
"10","I wore this out for my birthday....great outfit for early spring time in Michigan.","I am 5'9 and wore the size 6 - which fit beautifully, but was tight when I sat down for dinner.","I had small red marks on the tops of my shoulders when I took the jumper off - but well worth the wear anyhow!","A small price to pay for how good I felt the rest of the evening.","The zipper is difficult if you need to use the restroom alone, but I was able to manage it solo.","I am typically a 36C in a VS bra, but the top on this jumper is very tight, and held everything in place the way I needed it to, so I did not need to wear a bra (which is not usual for me, I typically need one).","The cut outs are sexy, yet sophisticated - the outfit has a commanding presence to it, which I loved as well!"
"10","Snug and tailored fit.","Paired with a white tank, navy leggings and brown booties.","Numerous compliments, including strangers!","A bit more casual than I anticipated- the blue is really denim, but a lovely jacket I was able to wear twice on unlimited."
"10","I was nervous about the dress because it was low cut and I have a relatively larger bust, but was so happy that it wasn't a problem."
"10","I wore this dress for a second time and it was very nice and appropriate for the occasion fit very nicely.","I received compliments throughout the evening."
"6","I was hoping this would be a more structured shift dress, but the sweater material is more flowy and less thick than I was expecting.","Cute print and enjoyed wearing once to work, but I wouldn't rent again."
"8","Loved this dress and got compliments.","I was wondering if the flowers on the dress were going to be gold or silver because I had seen other reviewers describe them as both.","They are really an in between color, and will go with either gold or silver accessories.","I wore it with gold accessories and nude/beige shoes.","If you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top.","I found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders, even when I wore the smaller of my two selected sizes.","The dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders.","Probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types.","Both the 8 and the 10 fit but the 10 was really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole.","The 8 was still a little gappy and I was going to try to fix it with fashion tape.","But I ran out of time trying to get the fashion tape right and ultimately I think it was fine to wear as it was."
"10","Dress fit well.","The V was perfect.","Not to low.","A dress with POCKETS!!!","YAY."
"10","I absolutely adore this dress.","It was originally my back-up dress, but I liked it so much better than the original one I had wanted.","I wore it to the George Washington University Inaugural Ball, and despite the fact that I personally knew of at least 5 other people wearing the same dress, it didn't matter.","The color of the dress photographs beautifully, the neckline is very flattering, and the length was perfect."
"10","This dress is incredibly comfortable, and even has pockets.","The cutout in the back is adorable.","I am typically a small, and I listened to the other reviews and got an xs- great idea... this dress runs big.","The color is such a great shade too.","This was a fun dress for my friend's classy roller skating  bday!"
"10","RTR keeps getting better and better; this was my favorite dress so far (but I'm saying this every time)!","Perfect balance of sexy/sophisticated for my debut as a member of the Board of Directors for our YP organization.","The fit of this dress was beyond perfect and I was comfortable in it all night long.","I'm assuming it was fairly new, as the lace was stiff and thick, so I couldn't lift my arms above me head (not that there was much of this happening anyway, but the under breast lace would also make this a bad idea).","Wish I would have gotten a photo of the full lace back, it was amazing and I received compliments all evening.","Went no bra and felt that the stiffness of the lace top provided enough support.","Although the dress is lined, I did wear spanx underneath to tighten up and smooth out everything.","I would certainly rent again or purchase when available."
"10","true to size"
"10","Loved this dress and also received many compliments!","The color is great!","I wore the 8, which is my typical size.","I was surprised that I had no issues with the fit in the bust.","I'm a 34DDD, but this fit just fine, and in fact, there was a little extra room!","I wore a regular bra.","(My back-up size was a 10, which was too loose, but I don't think the 6 would have worked as it might have been too small in the armholes.)","I added a brown leather belt and wore brown high-heeled sandals with gold jewelry.","The dress was fun to dance in and very comfortable.","Highly recommend."
"6","Wore this to my baby shower and received many compliments.","I did end up wearing a nude tank top underneath as pregnancy made my chest bigger than normal and as a non chesty pre-pregnant lady, the amount of cleavage made me uncomfortable, however, this seems to be highly personal as all of my friends insisted I didn't need one (As a sizing note, when I wore this dress I was a large 34D/maybe a bit bigger and about 170lbs)."
"8","I loved the color and cut of the dress... and the pockets!","It was perfect for my graduation party.","However, the dress does run big.","I ordered the size up as my back-up size which was a big mistake!","The top of the dress was definitely way too roomy.","I would recommend ordering a size down as a back up!","Overall, great dress!"
"6","I ordered a small and a medium and ended up wearing the medium.","The shorts portion of the romper are very small, more like booty shorts and the wait band is tight but then the top is very loose.","The medium that I wore was also very wrinkly and I didn't have time to steam it.","The top flap of the romper had some inner fabric that hung down too which was frustrating and I couldn't fix it.","I would suggest ordering one size up and give yourself a lot of time to steam!!","!"
"10","The gown was amazing.","I am a bottom heavy girl, but from the moment I tried it on, there was no struggle and fit amazingly.","I was the hostess at this wedding, so I needed comfort and movement.","The gown did not disappoint.","And the compliments!!!!!!!!!!!!","Even the bride said I looked wonderful."
"10","The fit was a little snug on my ribs but I have very wide ribs so it’s nothing new.","Gorgeous length and I got so many compliments."
"10","Wore this to a Fairytale Ball with my family.","Fun easy dress!","It did run big--I'm usually a 4 and I wore the 2 (I'm 5'2 and 120)."
"10","I'm usually a 10 in dresses, but have a full bust, so I'm glad I went with the 12.","At first I thought it would be itchy but it wasn't at all.","I received tons of complements.","I would definitely rent again!"
"10","I was a little hesitant to rent this as I've rented Lilly Pulitzer dresses in the past and they have been too short and/or too tight.","This dress however was perfect!","The material is thick and vibrant blue with lovely gold detailing down the front.","The 4 fit perfectly (maybe even a little roomy), although I would not have sized down.","I wore this for a date night out while in FL and received tons of compliments.","It was easy to move around in and was totally comfortable all evening.","It was brand new with the tags on it when I received it which was a nice bonus!","It was dressy and classy enough for a summer wedding, but also would work for something less formal.","Was sad to send this back!"
"8","The dress is very flattering and the color is gorgeous,  It is true to size, but long.","I wore with 4 heals and it was still about 1/2 too long.","I probably could have worn a size 2 since I am small on top and that would have likely been the right length.","It is a great dress!"
"8","This dress was a ton of fun to wear.","It was very flattering and the open back gave it a little something extra.","I wore an adhesive bra, but it didn't really make a difference, as the front is formed.","I am pretty rectangular in shape and did notice that the dress was a little tight in the rib cage area.","Overall, it was a super fun dress and I received a ton of compliments."
"10","Perfect for clubbing in Vegas!","I wore the 8 but the 6 fit as well.","Wear with a nu-bra or no bra at all."
"10","Absolutely LOVED the cut and fit of this dress!","EVERY client I encountered that day complimented me on this dress.","I typically am in between a size 12-14, but this size 12 was extremely comfortable.","A must try."
"8","I wore this dress to a friends wedding and it was a big hit.","I felt super glamorous and I got a ton of compliments.","My only complaint was the length.","I'm 5'9 and I could have used 3-4 more inches to achieve the look I wanted in heels.","RTR definitely did not disappoint and I'm currenlty looking for next rental!"
"10","This is up there as one of my all time RTRs.","The dress is perfect.","The faux crop cutout hit right in a flatter part of my waist.","My bra didn't peek out of the bottom, and it was long enough.","Great fit and beautiful color and details.","I felt super sexy and confident on my Valentine's Day date."
"10","The only con, the sequins rub on the inside of your arms.","Wear body glide or another protective product to prevent this."
"8","The inside of this jacket almost reminds me of a sweatshirt like material...this is super soft and comfortable.","It's not as crisp, stiff or dressy as I thought, and maybe a little bit raggy, but overall I felt it dressed up my jeans and was easy to throw on over a dress for work.","Biggest complaint - I though the 6 would be way too big on me.","It was perfect other than the length...so short!","!"
"10","This dress fit exactly as it says it does.","It was exactly what I was looking for.","I would wear it again in a heartbeat."
"10","Was unable to wear as the garment was received damaged; however, I tried on anyway.","I am tall, but have a shorter torso and long legs and this would have been the perfect fit.","Top part was a little big, but I am smaller chested - could have made it work.","This can be dressed up or down and is a great color!"
"10","Great item, will definitely rent again in the future!","Fits true to size."
"8","This dress is really pretty and super interesting.","The cut flatters your shoulders & arms.","I didn't end up wearing it though - it hit me right at the knees and the skirt was very full - highlighting my hips which I didn't love.","I kept going back & forth, but ultimately returned the dress without using it."
"8"," At first I was a little unsure about the jumper when it arrived.","I order a 4 and it was a little tight on my chest and waist.","I could of really used the 6 however it wasn't available for my back up size.","The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was  the front it bagged out a little by the lower stomach.","But I just kept pulling it down or used the pockets when I felt unsure of the look.","I paired the outfit a skinny belt and a fancy necklace.","Received a lot of compliments all night!"
"10","The dress is really pretty and I received so many compliments for it!","I am a petite girls and it fir me perfectly.","I really wanted to buy it!","I will definitely rent it again1"
"10","The paneling truly is a work of art.","Reminds me of a Monet piece, waterlillies in particular.","Wore to work and got many many compliments.","The panel is placed in such a way that it accentuates the waist beautifully and brings the eye in to the smallest part of your waist."
"10","Fit well, even though I don't typically like sleeveless.","This was my second choice and I like it, but I was disappointed I didn't get my first choice."
"8","Limited range of arm motion but excellent comfortable dress.","Stretchy material makes it an easy wear and comfortable all night long.","The dress was the perfect length for heels, sparkled all night long, and made me stand out all night!"
"10","Runs a little large"
"8","A nice temporary complement to my all black wardrobe.","The fabric is a little itchy around the neck, but my skin is kinda sensitive so it could just be me.","It is the perfect weight for these cool spring nights."
"8","This dress is so unique and vibrantly colored.","I ordered in sizes 2 & 0.","The only downside to my  experience was that the size 0 came without the liner, had a rip in the mesh in a very noticeable place, and was strangely too large on me compared to the 2.","(The 0 was larger in the arm openings and length, as well as the waist hitting lower... Maybe it was mismarked?)","Thankfully the 2 fit like a 2 should and was in great condition.","It was very comfortable to wear and I got more compliments than I could count, which is saying a lot at a wedding of 25 people.","I agree with the stylist notes: keep shoes and accessories simple with this fabulous dress.","I wish I owned it and would probably rent again.","This was my first RTR experience and the return process couldn't have been more simple."
"8","Love the shirt.","The print is very pretty, but I am a 36D chest, and it was tight.","It wasn't uncomfortably tight or anything, and I still wore it, and got compliments.","I loved the sleeves."
"10","Loved this romper!","Wore it out a couple nights while on vacation, it was too good to only wear once!","I am 5'4'' and it was the just right length on me, otherwise may have been a big too short.","Runs true to size."
"10","I had my eye on this dress for a long time, and this May outdoor wedding was the perfect occasion.","The color is beautiful, and the unique fabric looks great in person.","It was comfortable and light, and I got compliments all night.","I usually wear size 2-4, but the 2 was not available.","The 4 fit great (and gave me more room for free wedding food/drinks!","), but I think a 2 would have been the perfect size for this one.","Wore it with a simple Kendra Scott necklace and black heels, then changed to boots for the reception.","Definitely one of my RTR favorites!"
"10","I gained some weight lately (normally I'm a small/medium, but right now I'm a medium/large) and have been trying to hide it while I work it back off and felt like I needed a large.","This is definitely a shirt that is great for hiding your bad areas!","I easily could have worn a medium instead of a large, but because of the ruffles and general loose cut of the shirt I'm sure the different between the two isn't a big difference."
"10","Cannot say enough wonderful things about this dress.","It fit beautifully and the fabric had enough stretch that I could still sit, dance, and move around comfortably.","Looked fantastic and got compliments all evening!","Also--I have a small chest and was able to wear the dress without a bra--a win all around!"
"8","The dress that I originally picked came back damaged, and I decided on this one as a replacement.","Unfortunately, this dress was very tight around my ribcage/breasts I did not wear it as it would not zip up.","If you're larger up top, size up."
"10","Beautiful color, lots of compliments.","I went up a size but shouldn't have.","Runs true to size."
"4","The jumpsuit is fun and elegant!","I'm a size 6, but due to other reviews, I order the size 8.","It fit perfect, but the reason I give it 2 stars is that it arrived damaged and I could not wear it."
"10","I love red dresses and this is a great one for work.","It was loose, which is great for everyday."
"8","I loved this dress on the site and wanted it for work.","After reading the reviews, I made sure to rent a size bigger than my normal 10.","Well, unfortunately the 12 was still way too tight around the bust and shoulders (I have broader shoulders due to kickboxing).","So I think a size 14 would be perfect for me but they don't make it.","So size up accordingly and busty/curvy ladies, beware!","PS My husband loved it on me so at least it was flattering to the beholder."
"8","This great jacket was a crucial part of a Raining Men  Halloween costume I put together.","Fit is very slimming, length is perfect,  and the material feels well made.","Normally I would have ordered a small in this jacket but there  wasnt one available, I took my chances and ordered the xs, which was snug around the shoulders but still worked.","I live in San Diego, a place that doesn't experience a lot of rain or else I would totally buy this piece to add to my wardrobe.","Great classic coat!"
"10","Easy elegance in this dress.","Super comfortable and flattering to a curvy athletic figure.","Got many unsolicited compliments all night!","I am 5'5 and the regular length was perfect with 4  heels.","Ordered it the day before my event and it was delivered right on time .","Wish I could keep it."
"10","It's a very soft comfortable outfit.","You can wear it with flats for every day or dress it up with cute heels.","One of my favorite brands and would look good on any body type."
"10","My friends planned an amazingly memorable bachelorette party for me in Chicago.","They are fabulous!","With them all in white, this silver Slate & Willow stunning made me the center of attention.","The dress runs true to size, and if you're like me, you can enjoy the exposed back without a bra cutting across the geometric structure.","This dress is a lot darker than it appears in photos.","It's more of a dark silver/gray.","Still, it was absolutely stunning and surprisingly comfortable."
"10","I usually wear an 8 but the arms were snug so I ordered the 10 and it fit great!"
"8","The material was surprising.","It wasn't as soft as i had thought, but I didn't mind it.","I wore this for a date, but didn't feel like it was special enough to wear again.","The stripes are extremely flattering."
"8","I wore this for Valentine's day.","It was very pretty, in a fun color and flattering.","It fit nicely and I wore it with a regular bra and no SPANX.","Not my favorite thing ever, but a nice option.","The lace looks very nice."
"6","Overall, I loved this dress and I thought it flattered me very well.","But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.","1.","The bust area is extremely loose.","It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.","I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).","2.","Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.","If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.","Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.","However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.","3.","The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.","I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).","The dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.","It just needs some adjustments to make it the perfect fit."
"8","My first time renting and everything went well!","I saw that many of the reviews said that the dress ran big and to order down, and I'm glad I listened.","Normally wearing a Medium, I ordered Med & Small and the Small fit much better.","The dress is on the shorter side but wasn't a problem for me (at 5'1 it hit me a couple inches above the knee) but I could see it being an issue if I was taller.","The back is the best part!","It's a little peek-a-boo without being too much AND since the cut out is higher on the back, a bra can easily be worn.","I wore a strapless but after the fact I realized I could have worn a regular bra and it would have been fine... oh well!","Overall a great dress, a bright fun color, and comfortable to wear in the heat!","No negatives - you get exactly what you see in the photos."
"10","Wow!","Simply put, I loved this dress and felt amazing in it.","My husband asked me several times what it would cost to keep it and I got tons of compliments from friends and strangers alike.","The fabric is gorgeous and although it does seem heavy on the hanger, it drapes and moves beautifully.","I got the 12 L and it was long enough for me to wear 3 inch heels for an effect similar to the model photo - the back of the train swept the floor and my shoes peeked out just a bit in the front.","This dress is fully lined which helps give a smooth profile, but I found that a body shaper underneath helped me feel more comfortable with a post-baby belly!","I would 100% rent this dress again."
"8","I really hoped this would fit but I have a long torso for my height and found it was too short in that respect.","I have had problems with other jumpers for the same reason so I was not entirely surprised.","I probably could have made it work except since it was strapless it was being pulled down and wouldn't stay up.","I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who has a slightly longer than average torso and/or small bust that won't hold up the jumper at the top."
"8","I read the previous reviews and ordered a size down from my usual 2.","The 0 fit great allover!","It's a pretty short dress, so keep that in mind.","Amazing color is really flattering."
"10","Great dress!","Runs a little small, could of used the 4"
"8","The fit of this gown was spot on.","I am usually a size 12-10.","Depending on the brand.","I ordered a 10L with a 12L as back up.","The size 10 fit like a glove.","As you can see, the 10L was actually a little short.","The 12L was EVEN SHORTER, ;like 4 inches shorter (bizarre).","I'm not all that tall.","About 5'7 in bare feet.","My heels brought me up to about 5'11 and the 10L still didn't graze the ground (the 12L was UNWEARABLY short!","Seriously, I almost wish I'd gotten the XL).","I was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves.","I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy.","This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING!","I'm not kidding!","It also helped with my less than perfect arms.","This dress has a good amount of stretch.","The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the amount of layers.","The pictures don't really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect.","Overall, I would recommend this dress.","It was very comfortable and it didn't feel too heavy.","I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra.","Overall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion.","I would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel (which are notoriously COLD).","I was comfortable throughout the event, while many of my friends complained of being cold."
"10","Amazing dress.","Tons of compliments.","Fits beautifully.","It's short and slightly flaired so if showing legs isn't your thing then don't rent.","That said, it looks great with knee high boots and/or tights.","Perfect fall dress but also worked in cold winter weather."
"10","The dress fit perfect!","The length was great and it did show a little cleavage but not too much that I couldn't wear a regular bra.","Got tons of compliments!"
"10","Wore to a rehearsal dinner.","Used a backless bra.","Comfortable and chic."
"10","It's a bit smaller than I expected, so I wore the backup size.","Except that, the dress is gorgeous, great color and really comfortable."
"8","The dress was true to size but a little fitted around the hip area.","I went with the one size smaller because it accentuated the waistline better.","The fabric is gorgeous and the color is striking in person.","A must have for a wedding or similar event!","#fabulous #weddingflorals"
"10","I am 7 1/2 months pregnant and I was not a small petite girl to begin with.","This dress made room for my breast (which are much larger now thanks to the baby) and my baby bump!","It fit perfectly!!","The only think I would've done differently is get it longer (on account of my baby bump making my dress look a bit short) ."
"10","Loved the fabric, it was a great material and the perfect red!","I usually wear a 6 sometimes an 8 and i wore the 2.","It was a little small around my arms but fit my waist and bust perfectly.","The 4 was too big on my top half."
"10","GORGEOUS dress!","Super classy, with a touch of sexy.","I didn’t end up wearing this dress - the photo is of me in the 4L, which was a little short in the front and which I had to wear spanx with and still showed a little too much tummy for me.","The 6L which i don’t have a photo or me in was much better and I didn’t need the spanx.","I ended up choosing the Navy Stanfield Gown, for the X factor/open back, but for a more conservative crowd I absolutely would have worn this."
"10","This dress fit perfect.","It came the day before my event and tracking was easy and transparent.","The dress was a deep red, made of a nice, heavy material.","The dress was much more complex then the simple looking dress in the website pictures.","It looks very expensive and special in real life.","The scrunching was beautiful and very flattering.","The strapless top felt secure and I really only pulled it up out of habit.","Would recommend for any formal event."
"2","It was way too big and had an odd fit."
"10","Fit great for me.","Not too much room in the chest area, size up if you are bigger then a C.  The boning in the mid section is really great and kept the dress in place all night.","The only issue i had was the zipper, since there is so much pleating on the bodice the zipper is hard to get past the waist.","Had to have my husband hold fabric in place while i gently pulled.","Length was long for me, hem tape is a nightmare since this has a Aline shape to it, getting an even hem proved rather difficult.","All in all it was gorgeous and fit beautifully."
"6","I normally wear a 4, but this was tight.","The torso was just built smaller and it gapped where it shouldn't"
"10","This dress runs very tight in the waist.","Also, I have an average chest size & my bottom half is why I wear a size 6, so the top was too big for me.","The darts were sticking out a bit near the armpits, but it wasn't overly noticeable."
"8","The dress was fantastic.","Both sizes fit great - I went up a size just because I had been sick and my chest and back hurt - but I could have worn either one.","They were both quite long on me.","I read the reviews that stated it would be ok with heels, but I had on 3 in heels, and both were still to long, but nothing that just picking up the hem couldn't fix.","I loved the dress!"
"10","So easy to wear, so flattering, and subtler but unique."
"8","Loved it!","The dress was very comfortable minus that it is a little tight around the waist (but the entire dress was too big with the next size up).","I was able to wear a normal bra and it had a full skirt.","I felt the top was a little big (my bust is small) but it wasn't noticeable to anyone besides me.","It also tended to show a bit of cleavage when sitting down.","I also felt the length was good.","Overall, a win!"
"8","I wore this dress to my own birthday dinner.","I thought it was a very fun dress.","In fact, I said it was my modern 80's dress.","The skirt is very flouncy, and the white material is definitely a heavy brocade.","It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I thought it was different in a good way.","The bodice fits well and is very flattering, but do be aware that the skirt is very fitted where the black and white fabrics meet.","I thought it would have more give there than it did, so just be aware that it will fit tightly.","Overall, I enjoyed it, and I felt good on my birthday!"
"10","Love this dress!","I chose to wear this to a friend's 1920's themed birthday party.","I felt a little sexy with the gorgeous open back and the glam came from the material and sparkle.","A must to rent for NYE or black tie event."
"10","The dress looks red in the photos but is really a bright, beautiful salmon/coral pink in person.","The cut is very flattering and looks great on camera.","I highly recommend this dress!"
"8","Somehow the color was different from my expectation, but loved it.","It is more smoky salmon pink rather than baby pink."
"10","Wore this w/ red patent pumps to match the red flashes in the sequins.","The party theme was New Orleans, so I thought, Perfect!","I was way overdressed for the crowd, but my husband I had a ball.","Got so many compliments the whole night!"
"8","Rented this for everyday wear.","Great leather bomber.","Beautiful rust red color"
"10","I felt like a movie star in head to toe sparkles.","The dress moves like a dream and is delicious to spin around in.","I was steeped in compliments all night long and felt sexy, glamorous and fun!","Easy to wear, dance in, sit and pose.","A little chafing under the pits, but nothing I couldn't put up with as a price for wearing this showstopper."
"10","The dress fit perfectly - the material does stretch so it hugs your curves and is comfortable.","I expected to need to wear a long since I am 5'11'', but the regular was the perfect length with flats (so it does run long).","I received a lot of compliments and never wanted to take it off!"
"10","Absolutely love this jacket -- with dark jeans and a nice t shirt, it's equally perfect for a casual work environment or drinks with friends."
"4","I so wanted to love this dress.","The neckline is fantastic and I like the pattern on top.","However, the pattern accentuated my belly fat and made it stand out!","No thanks.","I did not wear this out to the wedding as planned.","Also my husband didn't like the dress, he didn't understand the mixed patterns, haha.","Thick fabric hid imperfections (except tummy) and my butt looked awesome in it.","I've been looking at other dresses by this designer, hoping to find one that's better."
"8","While it fit there were simply too many pleats and I felt swallowed up by the fabric.","The leg slit was not visible while walking."
"10","Seriously though, I forgot to take a picture, but I've got 34DDD boobs, a tiny waist, and some thighs and the dress is tight but tight in the right places.","If you like yourself, you will like this dress.","I know I looked good.","Sorry that I don't have photographic evidence!"
"10","Fit like a dream.","A little tight in the chest but all my clothes usually are.","This hit right at the knee.","I got so many compliments on the color and on the little bow!"
