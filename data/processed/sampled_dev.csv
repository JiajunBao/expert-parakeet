"date","Ran true to size, was a classy length, and loved the color!"
"date","This is the most flattering thing I have worn in my 2nd trimester.","Not only can you pair it with some comfortable leggings, but the shirt itself is super comfortable.","I would normally wear an XS and I probably could have gotten away with the XS, but the Small was the perfect most flattering length to cover my booty.","Great shirt - cant say that enough!"
"date","The dress was way small.","I wear a lot of Theory clothes, all size 2 but this one simply did not fit!","Everything was tight for me.","The dress is very structured and you have to be really skinny to wear.","Not recommended for curvy women."
"date","I am a size 2 and usually wear and XS, but I could barely get my arms through this.","Had to send it right back.","It is cute, but I never got to wear it."
"date","Loved it!","The medium would have fit me fine, but the Large gave me more length in the legs.","its short!!","Sexy!!","!"
"date","I rented this dress for my birthday weekend for date night and it was so comfortable.","It can be dressed up easily with heels and fun jewelry.","The only reason I would give this a 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 is because the bust was tighter than I expected given the flowy fit through the hips.","If youre bustier, just be aware that when you size down for fit through the waist (as I did), the bust is much tighter!","However, I got several compliments :).","I wish I took a picture!"
"date","Wrap style makes it easy to customize fit - looked great with wedges, lots of movement on dress!"
"date","I rented this dress for Valentines day.","It was super cute, very stretchy.","Im 57 125 lbs and rented the S and XS as backup.","I liked the way the XS fit better but the slip under the dress was longer then the dress, so I ended up wearing the S because it didnt have that problem.","I would love to rent this dress again for other occasions."
"date","I wore this for my one year wedding anniversary to The Setai Hotel Sunday Brunch.","Its a snazzy hotel, so I wanted something cute but not formal and appropriate for a Sunday brunch.","I paired it with my nude red bottom heels and it was perfect.","It was super comfortable and the material was really nice.","I didnt want to return it, and I actually found it for sale on the Kate Spade website (on sale for $190!)","I wear a size 12, but ordered a 14 as a backup, and the 12 was perfect, in fact I think I might have been able to wear a 10 to be honest.","Its a bit tricky to take off since the buttons only go down to the waist, but other than that it was perfect.","RTR also has it in black and Im thinking of renting it for NYE.","Absolutely recommend!"
"date","I am not sure if it is me, but it seems to fit tight across the chest."
"date","Great fit - conservative neckline but very feminine shape."
"date","I love the color, print and relaxed look for this dress.","I usually wear petite sizes and I found the sleeve length and overall fit to be too large.","Luckily, it has an adjustable drawstring around the waist but it was gaping on top so I had to wear a cami underneath.","I would recommend sizing down."
"date","Fit was great, im usually a 0 or 2 and went w/ the 2. the details on the top are even prettier in person.","i was very impressed w/ the quality.","the shirt is tailored so the V-cut is not too deep.","I thought from the photo i might need a safety pin but its tailored just right (im a 32B for reference).","I wore out w/ jeans and wore to work w/ black pants and heels.","Very versatile, a shirt you could go from day to night in."
"date","I ordered the 18W based on the size chart plus a 20W as backup.","The 18W was HUGE!","I could not wear.","Plus I should mention the dress is very heavy weight was between the lace and the lining.","I would not order this again."
"date","This dress is incredible; one of the first that I want to purchase.","The fit is snug around the hips (Im a size 2, 25 inch waist and with a 40 inch hip.","Needless to say it was tight.","This dress highlights your waist line so some may feel more comfortable with Spanx, if not, size up."
"date","I had to use shorts under the dress to avoid showing too much when I sit.","The skirt was waaaaaayyy too short for me."
"date","its warm fabric -so perfect for fall or raining day,as it have long sleevs -but sexy, on the photo it doesnt show that you can have nice cleavelage with this dress-whats make it very sexy,i probably would be better with size S-as sleeves was pretty tight-but wearable.","& if you want take it to next level of sexy- wear high tights- the wrap dress let you have that sexy peek a boo- may make it that date/night dinner with your boyfriend or  husband more special!"
"date","I wore this dress for a special birthday dinner.","Gorgeous, rich color is more purple than maroon.","The secondary color is black.","Could be worn with black tights and still look elegant.","Fit my body type perfectly.","The skirt is loose but not a full skirt.","This cut made it so easy to wear.","May be difficult if you have a large bust (not much stretch).","There is nothing I would have changed about this dress.","Another amazing RTR experience!","!"
"date","Again, I loved everything about it.","I imagine however, a very small framed person might get lost in it."
"date","Dress runs large.","Was great for a night out or would be perfect for a wedding.","Loved it!"
"date","It was a bit big, should have ordered a small but was overall extremely comfortable and cute!","really easy to throw up, and to dress up or dress down, got tons of compliments would 100% recomend"
"date","pros: flatteringcons: very low v cut and sleeves are not snug so if tape is not used the sleeves may fall a bit"
"date","Not too warm for late summer/early fall.","Sexy without being too revealing.","Would rent again!"
"date","This dress was a backup dress sent to me.","The material is nice and thick and the color is a bright cobalt blue.","I didnt think that the pattern was necessarily very flattering on my body, however.","Ended up wearing my first choice anyways."
"date","Overall pretty romper"
"date","True to size.","Hides flaws.","Need a strapless bra."
"date","It was cute, but super tight and showed every bump.","Im pretty skinny and I still felt like it highlighted my midsection in an unflattering way.","I didnt feel comfortable in it and ended up not wearing it."
"date","Great pattern & colors (as with all Mara Hoffman looks).","I liked that it felt a little more substantial and well made than a standard casual maxi dress.","Its pretty structured and fitted, creates a flattering shape.","Also fully lined, so could get a little hot if worn on a hot summer night.","I wore it to a birthday dinner in NYC in June and it wes perfect.","Im 54 and wore 4 inch heels and the length was great.","Hope this helps!"
"date","This dress is simple and classy, but it came down to my knees.","I thought it would have been shorter.","It was nice just not what I was hoping for."
"date","Much longer than it looks on model.","If you are under 55 Im not sure this would really work as it was about as long as could be on me.","It looked really cute with a black tee tucked in and heels for a dinner date though.","However after wearing it for a few hours (only going to and from dinner - not even really even moving around that much) the butt of the skirt had stretched out and looked quite dumpy (see pic).","The front still looked great, but keep that in mind depending on where/for how long you are planning to wear it."
"date","really superb"
"date","This was my second choice and I did not end up wearing it.","The dress has a side zip under the arm to enhance the snug fit.","This dress hugged my curves and looked fabulous.","It just wasnt my favorite in comparison to the other dress I rented."
"date","Im usually uncomfortable in dresses because of my weight at the time I wore this, but I loved how flattering this dress was.","It had a nice amount of cleavage was well."
"date","Pros: beautiful color, interesting cut, sexy, classy, quality fabric/texturePotential Cons: cant wear a bra"
"date","I wore this dress on a date to see a broadway play.","People wear all kinds of stuff to the theater now but i knew i wanted to dress up without wearing something too over the top.","This dress was perfect for the occasion.","I wore it with sheers stockings, black stacked knee-high boots, a gold chain and a neon green purse.","The pattern is gorgeous and fabric is very comfortable.","All in all, a great dress to rent."
"date","Thicker fabric was great to smooth curves and keep warm for winter.","This would be too heavy for summer or a warm climate.","Ran very small.","2 was tight, and Im usually a 0 or 2.","Very happy with this rental, fun and comfortable to wear!"
"date","The cut of the dress is very flattering and the sleeves were the perfect length.","I thought I could pull off a small due to the shape of the dress, but the fabric doesnt have as much give as I thought, so it was a tight fit.","Still looked great.","My boyfriend said it was his favorite yet and suggested I get it again for Christmas.","May try a medium this time though."
"date","Fits true to size.","However, it does show a bit of cleavage.","For women with a larger bust, you might want to use some double sided tape for extra security."
"date","Loved this dress... a little more cleavage than I was expecting but it worked well for date night ;)"
"date","This is by far the most flattering outfit Ive rented from RTR.","I have an hour glass figure.","I am self conscious about my big arms and back fat but I love my legs...this was the perfect outfit to minimize and accent what I hate/love.","The see through panels on the side and back are more on the opaque side and I felt well covered but still sexy.","The neckline plunges deep.","I have a large B cup and felt a little self conscious at times but not enough to not rent it again!","I love this one!","Get it and rent it!"
"date","This is a beautiful dress and extremely flattering.","I wore it for Valentines Day and my boyfriend was drooling over me!","haha :) However, its very fitted so you need to wear spanx or some type of fitted undergarment.","I dont think this dress would be good for girls with smaller busts because I usually have to go up a size because of my chest but the size 2 fit me perfectly."
"date","Wore this for date night before Christmas eve.","Went out because we didnt feel like cooking and I had received this dress as an upgrade/backup.","Beautiful color, nice stitched detailing.","Not cut too low for me to be uncomfortable.","Paired with black heels, black pea coat and silver scarf for a wonderful night out!"
"date","Fit me well since I am small chested.","If you are busty, order a bigger size."
"date","fit well, was a bit loose and didnt realize it was completely open on the front.","classy and sexy all in one"
"date","This fit perfectly.","Super chic and tons of compliments.","As soon as I put it on my boyfriend begged me to buy it.","Even being 6ft tall it still fit well and I was not uncomfortable.","I would rent again and again!"
"date","The dress is beautiful but it is so long!","I do not have heels high enough that would bring this dress off of the floor, and I am 57 so this is very long.","It would be pretty if you had very high heels and were going to dress this up, I was looking to wear it more casually so it didnt work."
"date","I did not need a bra with this dress.","It was a little stiff but I would rent this one again."
"date","I loved this dress.","It fit a little large for me in the chest (Im a 34A though), but I thought the dress overall was very flattering and easy to wear."
"date","I rented this dress to wear out to dinner for my fiances birthday.","It is such a fun dress and I would love to wear it again.","The material is thick and feels very durable.","I wore the larger size because of the length.","The size 4 fit all around but was way too short, so I wore the 6 to keep it an appropriate length.","It is still very short, so might not be the most appropriate for all affairs.","The dress is great because it can be dressed up with heels, or dressed down with flats/sandals and a jacket.","Definitely worth the rental."
"date","My arms are my problem area and are big for my size.","I optimistically ordered a L, but couldnt fit my arms all the way.","This jacket is a great material and is VERY cute, so I will be returning to rent an XL!"
"date","The dress is probably very pretty to other women - but all the guys I met thought it looked stuffy and uncomfortable."
"date","i absolutely loved this dress.","I wore it to a celebration dinner in NYC and it was perfect.","Just the right amount of sparkle...I was worried it would be too flashy, but it was subtle.","The fit was very flattering and true to size.","I ordered a 2 and 4 just to be safe and wore the 2."
"date","I normally wear a size 2 but needed to wear the 4 because of the sleeves.","I do have broader shoulders which may have caused this.","The dress felt tight in the shoulders and chest but tons of room in the hips and waist.","At only a B cup having a large chest was definitely NOT the issue.","The sleeves make is extremely difficult to move around.","We just went to dinner so it wasnt bad but scooting in and out of a cab was not fun and dancing would have been near impossible!","I received ton of compliments and if youre just standing there its amazing!","But if youre going to do a lot of moving around, be prepared to feel a little awkward since the sleeves have zero stretch"
"date","Pros: Cute pattern, nice material Cons: Top is very loose and fit isnt great I think on the right body type, this dress would be very cute.","It didnt work for me.","It wasnt horrible, but I knew that if I wore it out, Id be self-conscious about the top all night.","You definitely need to wear a tank top/cami under this dress.","It doesnt lay as nicely as it does on the model."
"date","Fit perfect in the hips and butt.","Was big on me in the chest and waist.","Comfortable.","Quality material."
"date","Ordered a L and XL as Im usually somewhere in between.","The zipper on the L kept catching so I opted to just go with the XL.","XL was a little loose up in the bust and shoulder areas, but other than that everything was perfect.","Material on the inside was soft, stretchy, and comfortable.","Didnt have any issues with the dress being absolutely covered in sequins.","I thought that I would be self conscious due to the tightness of the dress--Not at all!","I felt confident and pretty--I even received a few compliments about the dress from strangers (something Im definitely not used to!).","I would totally rent this again!","Loved it!"
"date","This jumpsuit is a head turner..but beware it is tight!!","I am usually an 8 and the 8 wouldnt come close to zipping up the back.","the fabric has absolutely no stretch.","I went up to a 46R.","I did not have to wear a bra with a 36D top, the tightness held them in all night.","overall it was a stunner!"
"date","I had rented other dresses from the same designer in a Size Small and found it fit a little too snug for my taste so I ordered this dress in a Medium and felt much more comfortable.","Loved the elegance with a splash of sexy to this dress.","The only con I have is while walking I found I was constantly pulling the dress down as it kept riding up.","With the beautiful see-through lace back, I put on a pair of sticky boobs and I was ready to go!"
"date","Im 4ft 11 and  this dress was still a mini for me!","The sequins after awhile were quite painful under the arms."
"date","I wore this to my birthday dinner and loved it.","It definitely runs large.","I usually wear a size 4/S and wore the XS.","Its longer in the front, came right above my knees and the  asymmetrical hemline is very flattering.","I gave it 4 stars because, I think whoever had it before me dried it in their dryer and shrunk the top layer.","You could see the liner in the back (pictured).","Also, its much shorter in the back.","Just an FYI for the tall or rocking booty girls."
"date","Would not recommend this dress- it was uncomfortable and I felt like I was constantly adjusting the top, it was difficult to find a strapless bra that would not show.","Having said that, I did receive multiple compliments on it and it looks good in photos.","Would not rent again."
"date","A true winner.","Incredibly flattering, true to size and very comfortable to wear."
"date","I tried to put this dress on bottom up and thought it would never fit.","I then wrestled it on over my head and it fit tight, but perfect.","It is edgy and fun.","I love dresses that I dont have to dress up with jewelry, and this has so much design and texture, it fit the bill.","Loved it!"
"date","Fit great up top, but was super snug through the hips - which is why I wore a Medium rather than my usual Small.","It was far more comfortable to size up.","I was REALLY impressed with how comfortable this dress is for one that is covered in sequins.","I would definitely rent again!"
"date","I love this dress.","Its sexy and accentuates your curves, yet everything is still covered.","I would definitely rent this one again!"
"date","I loved this dress for a date - its extremely sexy and flattering.","One point of caution though - you cant really rely on the snaps on the straps to stay closed so I ended up having to tye the straps together to avoid a wardrobe malfunction."
"date","I plan to to rent this with my Unlimited subscription and purchase it with Try to Buy!","Beyond Obsessed!","I havent stopped thinking of this top since I tried it on.","I love it!!!","While most of the shirt does run on the large size (the sleeves for example) underneath there is a fitted bustier, which runs a bit small.","It certainly made me feel like I was very securely in the top and nothing would slip out.","I would wear this with either no bra or a strapless bra.","Perfection from Kendall + Kylie!!","!"
"date","I LOVE this dress!!!","I am a RTR Pro member and I used this as my birthday rental for going to dinner with my boyfriend.","It fit perfectly.","I thought it would maybe be bit too frilly with the full skirt and maybe make me look bottom-heavy but the fabric is heavy enough that it falls quite nicely and doesnt poof out too much.","I wear a 36A bra and usually have problems with dresses being a bit too tight on my rib cage, but this fit so perfectly.","It would probably fit fine if you have a smaller band size as long as you have a larger cup size as well, otherwise it might be a bit too loose (at least in a size 8).","I rented the 8 and 6, tried the 8 on first, and it fit so perfectly I didnt even try on the 6!"
"date","I wore this dress for a date night where my boyfriends colleagues were floating around.","It was a great fit, flattering, and he liked it."
"date","So, I didnt actually wind up wearing this dress because the bustle made it a much bigger deal than I needed for the occasion I rented it for.","Its an incredibly fun and visually interesting dress that might feel costume-y if you dont wear it confidently.","Also, it weighs a ton.","Ill rent it again when I have the right occasion."
"date","The dress is chic and sophisticated with the moderately high-low hem, navy color, and zippered sleeve cuffs, but it was a last-minute replacement for a different bump-friendly dress.","Alas, this one is not bump friendly unless you are in the early weeks of pregnancy (I was late 2nd Trimester with a definite but small-ish bump).","The fabric is stiff, but for a fit-and-flare for the non-bumpy ladies, Im sure it would be a great conservative dress and Id try it again post-bump.","It was super-easy to accessorize and looks great with over-the-knee boots (it was chilly) or fab shoes."
"date","The top is large - the bottom was perfect, I had to use tape to keep the shoulders up - the smaller size was to tight in the hips.","The color was awesome and the dress if very pretty."
"date","Very sexy and comfortable - perfect for our Anniversary Dinner.","My husband loved it, and I caught a few other stares at the restaurant as well!","I will keep this one in my favorites for another rental in the future."
"date","I wore this out to dinner for my birthday.","I could have gone with the 4 or 6, but the 4 was a little better for me in the shoulders, and the dress is stretchy, so it worked overall.","The fabric is heavy and warm, which was great for the cold night I wore it on, but I would not have wanted to dance in it.","Its flattering and simple."
"date","Love this dress.","If in between, order a size up.","The dress is cut to your curves and the material is thick - doesnt give much.","But it is a GREAT choice for a night out.","Truly stands out from the crowd."
"date","Really large in the shoulders and long in the legs- would have ordered an XS if they had it"
"date","This top is pretty cropped in the front (Im 510) but it fit really cute and is a great color!"
"date","This was originally my back up dress however I fell in love.","Its the perfect dress for a night out..","The only downfall is its a little short.","If you got a booty beware that the dress rides up VERY quickly (which is why it lost one star) I used a stick on bra because I cant stand going braless.","However you really don;t need one.","I didnt want to take it off."
"date","This piece is so fun!","The cape detailing is different from anything Ive seen.","If you are looking to make a high fashion statement I would highly recommend it!","I would almost call it a long vest because you can wear it open or closed and absolutely need to wear a slip underneath.","There are only two buttons so the slit goes all the way to the top of the thighs.","It also has a very deep v neckline and you cant really wear a bra with it, but the extremely thick/heavy material helps hold everything in place.","It runs true to size, but I would size down as backup.","Love this style and will absolutely be wearing it out again!"
"date","I thought the dress was heavy feeling and looking.","Though I liked the way I looked, it was also QUITE short - I cant imagine if I were tall..."
"date","Fit well, pocket inserts sick out just a tad."
"date","The color is absolutely amazing and the material/fabric is incredibly comfortable.","Cant wear a bra though.","I would purchase in a heartbeat."
"date","This dress was fabulous.","My husband and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary with a fancy weekend get away and some fine-dining; so of course I needed a nice dress.","It was our first real evening out since the birth of our first baby.","I hadnt felt as fantastic or confident since before becoming pregnant.","This dress was the perfect final touch to top off our special weekend.","I would rent this dress again.1"
"date","I do not think I have ever got as many compliments for a dress as I did with this one!","First, the colors are much more virbant in person than they are in the pictures.","The dress has a really pretty shimmer to it that made it perfect for the engagement party I was attending.","Second, the cut was much more flattering than I thought it was going to be - a lot of the reviews said the dress was boxy but I did not find that to be the case.","I am pretty curvy so boxy is not a good look on me, but the dresses ended up looking great!","Slightly snug in the bust - but overall true to size!","Im short, so a lot of times dresses are just a little too long on me - but this was a great legnth!"
"date","Im typically a 0, so renting the 4 felt like a bit of a gamble, but the fit was absolutely perfect.","The dress fell just a bit longer than the model shows, and the fabric is absolutely amazing.","Unfortunately, I wore for just a short amount of time- but I will definitely be renting this again in the future when the dress code calls for funky and elegant.","Love love love."
"date","Loved this dress!"
"date","The material was heavier than I thought.","This dress is perfect for a fall/winter occasion."
"date","As with any rompter going to the bathroom is a bit more difficult but its totally worth it.","This outfit is very light weight and appears sheer when you take it out of the box.","However, once undergarments are on you could not see through it.","It has pockets which I love and add to making it more comfortable.","Great for hot weather!"
"date","Im short but the tightest part of the shirt was right around my midsection which gave me a muffin top.","It was smaller than I had expected."
"date","This dress is made very well and is figure flattering.","Im usually an 8, but in some designers I have to get a 10.","I went with a 10 and Im glad that I did!"
"date","Color is more orange/red Nice thick fabric!","Comfortable!","Im a 34 D/DD and it fit perfect !","I would rent this again!"
"date","Fit was True to Size!"
"date","I loved this jumpsuit...it was true to size but I didnt feel totally comfortable.","I have a hard time fitting into jumpsuits with larger legs so I think it was more of my own biased.","I received a ton of compliments!","Very versatile."
"date","Runs very small.","I am usually a 0 and the 2 was even tight in waist area.","Wish it was a little bit longer as well but overall simply a classy beautiful top"
"date","This dress nails the perfect combo of sexy elegance.","It is somehow understated, even as it carves out more curves than the road to Hana.","This dress is so beautifully constructed, I felt confident and able to move naturally - and even enjoyed a full dinner!","FIT:  Like all HL, this dress hugs your curves like a glove and holds everything in place - and somehow does this comfortably.","I am 51, and the dress came to mid-calf.","The fabric is heavy - like 2 lbs; no joke- so, it is warmer than it appears.","COLOR: Sumptuous navy that looks much richer in person, than in the picture.","The bright gold zipper in back really pops against the dress.","SIZE: Standard HL, which means one size smaller than usual.","I am usually an XS, but definitely a S in HL.","DETAIL:  What looks sexy, albeit more conservative in the front, suddenly sends off sirens with the gold zipper in back, which spans from top to bottom.","The zipper is absolutely what makes the dress."
"date","This dress was very comfortable but without the added cut out, it ended up seeming a bit more simple than I had originally intended.","It was warm and perfect for the cooler winter months.","I would recommend the dress but just caution around the cutout."
"date","Great fit and made me look skinny.","Im very big in the bust area and did not have to wear a bra"
"date","I will definitely be renting this again.","I wore it for a night out with friends and we were getting stopped in the street asking where I bought it.","Even people who had seen us an hour earlier walked up to say they had noticed it when we parked.","It is fitted in the waist so keep that in mind and order up if needed."
"date","Super cute top.","For fit, ideally I would have gone with an XS but I was at the showroom and XXS was the only available size and it looked great!","I wore it with a high wasted white cropped pants."
"date","Great fit, very elegant...was sad to have to return it!"
"date","The dress was really stretchy and was very flattering.","I wore it to a baptism and it was perfect for the occasion.","Because of the stretchy material of the dress the waist can rise up a little bit but it wasnt noticeable to anyone else.","I got a ton of compliments on it."
"date","Fitted styling of this dress makes it flattering, while the thicker material allows for forgiveness on your figure.","Ribbon like striping gives this little black dress a little punch.","Got lots of compliments tonight wearing this dress.",":) Also worth mentioning...as a taller girl (5 9), I loved the length of this dress.","If you are shorter, be aware of the length."
"date","I wore this dress to my husbands Marine Corps Birthday Ball, and it was perfect!","Ive always been one to enjoy standing out in a crowd, and this did it for me!","I received more compliments than I could count, and I felt fabulous.","It was a little on the short side, and I only wore (maybe) 3 inch heels, but it was perfect for dancing in!","As with any sequin dress, it did get a little scratchy under the arms, but nothing unbearable.","If youre thinking about renting this dress, do it!","Id do it a hundred times over again."
"date"," It was really comfortable and in good condition.","It was longer than expected.","The only thing is that the straps kept coming down."
"date","Fun statement jacket!","I wore this for a date night with a casual floral wrap maxi dress and studded booties - it made the outfit look very rock & roll.","It was a very snug fit (and I usually wear size 6 in jackets) and I could have easily been comfortable in a size Large.","I would have kept it to wear again but the cut was a tad short on the torso for me.","Wish I would have taken a pic!"
"date","I wear an 8, and only a 12 was available but I really wanted to try them out.","The 12 was a little roomy but actually looked fine because of the elastic material.","These are easy to dress up and wear to a cocktail event (which I did on Night 1), or dress down with some ankle boots and a swear (which I did on Night 2).","Will rent again, and possibly buy."
"date","fits true to size; fit just above my knee at 5 tall."
"date","The dress is really cute and the color is even nicer than in the photos.","However, it is very restrictive to arm movements.","It would be better if it were sleeveless."
"date","Amazing fit for curves.","Sexy but mostly just suggestive, a flesh color bra is perfect.","Loved it and WILL rent again.","Love clover canyon."
"date","I wanted a not too fancy dress for a summer dinner date.","It fit the bill for that.","It was a nice material (heavier than expected) that did not wrinkle.","While not fitted in the hip/butt area, it does run smaller than I expected.","I usually wear a 2, but went with the 4 to have a little more room."
"date","If you are shorter than 54 the dress might be too long for you.","You should also be comfortable with the possibility of not wearing a bra.","Other wise the dress was amazing.","My boyfriend loved it!","lol"
"date","I really felt like a goddess in this beautiful dress!","Wore it for to dinner to celebrate our anniversary, and received a few complements from strangers.","The color is gorgeous.","I typically wear size 8-10 pants, but due to tightness across the rib cage ended up wearing the 12R dress, which fit comfortably.","I think of my belly as my problem area, and this dress hid it well.","Im 57 and wore flats; it definitely would have been too short with heels, but I was happy to wear sandals!"
"date","This was cute and summery for a concert and date.","It is tight in the bodice so I just wore a regular bra and tucked my extra strap in.","Probably could have gone braless.","Tight and high on the neckline and shoulder, so dont expect it to feel flowy or super comfortable, but it is quite cute."
"date","This dress is really comfortable, a heavier textured fabric that was flattering.","Very comfortable with a bit of stretch.","I wasnt sure about the placement of the pockets but they worked out great.","I had my cellphone in my pocket and you couldnt even tell.","Hit below the knee for me, but very flattering.","Worked fine with my shorter torso.","Lots of compliments."
"date","Great for someone with a small bust because it is nearly impossible to wear a bra with it.","I loved it and got a ton of compliments on it!"
"date","This dress is beautiful.","It flatters the figure without being too snug."
"date","I rented the small and the medium.","Im normally a size 6 or 8, but this ran exceptionally large.","The small fit like a glove but the medium was too long in the sleeves and baggy in the torso.","I wore this romper for a night out in Vegas.","Make sure you have a friend, or make a friend, who can help you get zipped back up because going to the bathroom was a 2-person job.","I paired it with black stockings and black booties and it was comfortable all night long."
"date","Loved the dress - perfect fit and not too tight through the mid-section.","The vented sleeves are a fun touch.","Great pop of color!"
"date","I wore this out to a nice dinner with friends one evening.","I really loved the cut of this dress.","The v-neck was very flattering and I liked how the material of the dress had a nice shimmer to it.","I rented the 6 and 8, and ended up wearing the 8.","My body has been changing and I do think by the time I received this dress I wasnt a size 6 anymore, so I felt it was a true to size fit.","Got to wear a regular bra with it.","It was a longer skirt and I was able to sit, eat and drink in it comfortably all evening.","Again, great color and fit.","Would rent again."
"date","Fits nicely, thick material good for cooler weather but a little difficult to wear a cardigan or jacket with it because of the shoulder ruffle."
"date","Definitely wear a padded bra with it- if worn without, the top would have been too large."
"date","This was a beautiful dress that fit true to size or a bit small.","Im between sizes (4 to 6), and the 6 fit me perfectly.","This dress is classy, and the color is beautiful, but the style is conservative and older.","Perfect for me (40s) but maybe a bit too tame/mature for some.","I liked the length (hit just above the knee for me)."
"date","Fit extremely tight (not true to size)."
"date","Hugs curves in all the right ways.","worn with a leather jacket, my husband could not love it more!"
"date","I usually wear a size 8, but the material is stretchy and the 6 looked better.","Overall the dress is very flattering and comfortable.","The color is a lot more purple in person than it appears in pictures.","The cut is low and I found myself having to adjust often to hid my bra, but it wasnt too risque."
"date","Easy to wear, fit true to size.","An easy way to experiment with brighter colors and patterns - could be dressed up or down for your occasion."
"date","      I wore this out to dinner with my fiance and received a lot of compliments.","The material is very sturdy and hangs very well.","I am small on top and larger through hips and seat and this dress fit perfectly.","It was fitted through chest and waist and flared just slightly enough for it not to be tight in the hips.","This is great for pear shapes!","Be warned that while this dress looks very work-editorial it  only has the two buttons pictured so make sure to wear some black hot-shorts under because, when seated, this can open.","I didnt feel like it opened inappropriately when I crossed my legs but just enough to give a little peak of leg.","The top had a tendency to gap so you may also want to pair this with a bandeau top.","I have a feeling I will be renting this dress again!"
"date","Small fit, cute cut outs, straight up and down dress.","Cut outs added just enough sex appeal without being inappropriate.","This dress was in good shape but didnt fit great on my body type.","Im athletic but curvy with a shorter torso, so this wasnt a hit for me.","Could wear a bra and spanks under without issue.","Wont rent again."
"date","One of my favorite dresses that I have rented.","I love dresses that are easy to wear!","Meaning, you can slip it on over normal undergarments and not have to worry about it the rest of the night.","It was long enough that I could sit comfortably on a chair without it riding up.","I received a lot of compliments about the lace and the color.","Its a beauty!","!"
"date","This dress fits all shapes and sizes perfectly.","I ended up wearing the S and belting it, as I thought the style as is was not flattering for my body.","Just throw on (no zippers, or buttons), and go!","Print is great and soft for fall.","Material is midweight and silky.","I can easily see this dress being dressed up or down, depending on how you accessorize."
"date","Wore this fancy little number for an anniversary date night in Rome.","No bra worn with the dress.","Dress so super comfortable.","Dress was a little short so just be aware of dress length when sitting down.","If you have a tenancy to hunch your shoulders, the dress may spill off your shoulders.","Would wear again!"
"date","I really enjoyed this dress.","I went out for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend and his family.","It was sexy without being too risky.","The 6 fit more comfortably than the 4.","The back strap attaches to the other side of the dress with 3 hook and eyes (I think that is the right term lol).","There are two lengths to choose from and I was on the larger fit for both the 4 and the 6.","With the size 4 dress you were not able to see the additional hooks but with the size 6 dress you were.","I am not sure how but thats what was going on.","It wasnt all that noticeable though.","I was able to eat a large 8 course meal without my stomach bulging out or the dress feeling overly tight.","It was perfect.","I def would recommend."
"date","Recognize this dress, anyone?","That is because it is the same dress that Emma Stone wears in the 5 years later scene in La La Land, a movie with fantastic costume design.","I loved this dress.","I have larger breasts for my size and I definitely had some side boob happening.","It was slightly tight on me and slightly skimpy but for a sexy date, it is appropriate.","I would absolutely recommend it."
"date","This was such an amazing jumpsuit!","I wore it for my birthday dinner and absolutely fell in love and got so many compliments.","It fits like a glove and looks very expensive.","The fabric is thick and has a bit of a stretch.","Wish I could have kept it in my closet forever!"
"date","I am always a six, but from seeing the other reviews (thank you), I ordered the 8R and it fit perfectly.","The 6R definitely would have been too small.","The fabric is thick enough to wear in cold weather and it has great lining.","Two thumbs up!","!"
"date","Fit amazing.","Excellent detail throughout the lace.","Beautiful shirt.","Lots of compliments."
"date","I wore this to the office with a blazer, tights and my beloved Dear Frances boots.","Removed the blazer for date night and it was a great look!","Cons: this dress isnt very forgiving.","You cant eat a large dinner the night before or really have anything for breakfast or lunch, if you are intent about pulling this look off.","Im not really built for this look, but I managed to pull it off by skipping a few meals.",":)"
"date","This dress runs 1-2 sizes big....but IT IS AMAZING!","I had a free bday rental and it was mid week so I rented it for the office.","It was adorable, vibrant yet conservative!"
"date","I am a true size 6 and I ordered this dress in a UK 10 (UK conversion of US 6) I had to send it back and order a UK 12 (UK conversion to US 8) and the larger size fits well if not still snug in the hips.","Otherwise, I love this dress.","It is form fitting and gorgeous.","I plan to wear to a birthday dinner with black leather jacket and booties."
"date","I wore this to birthday dinner with my boyfriend.","We both loved the dress.","I tried looking up where I could buy it, but no luck!","Guess Ill have to rent it again!"
"date","I usually wear a 4, but have a long torso so I ordered the 6 and 8 in this jumpsuit as I usually have difficulty with fit.","The 6 fit like a glove with just enough room for comfort while still offering a chic tailored look.","Can dress this up or down.","I wore it out to dinner with friends and it was a hit!","Will definitely rent again!"
"date","This blouse was really fun and felt sexy.","I wore a long bralette under so that some lace peeked through the open side.","I was very comfortable and felt good in it.","Love the color.","The material is very thin.","Also, Id use a clutch as a purse with a strap will wrinkle the super thin material."
"date","Just adorable."
"date","SOOO many compliments.","The fit was a bit loose but I managed the top with fashion tape.","This is a statement dress for sure."
"date","The fit was amazing.","It fit just right and was very forgiving to my figure.","The lace is gorgeous."
"date","The dress was a little bit tight in the chest, but fit great everywhere else!"
"date","So comfy, especially because I wore it with leggings, but wish I had gone with a large.","Cute though!"
"date","Like my last CS dress, seems to be made for a long torso.","Sleeves fold over a bit so you can see inner lining, which may be an issue for shorter gals.","Beautiful fabric, amazing color."
"date","The bottom front hem wasnt pressed right otherwise great very sexy dress ... date night with my husband.","I rented this again.. this time the hem was great...ended up buying it...love this dress."
"date","This dress is definitely one of my favorites.","I wore it to work then for date night.","The neckline is quite low but i am also very short.","The fabric was very lightweight so i stayed cool & comfortable all day!","I got so many compliments on the dress.","The colors are absolutely stunning!"
"date","Ok...why did it take so long for someone to use neoprene for dresses!",";) These dresses are not only comfortable, but VERY flattering (its like wearing spanx, without the granny lines!!)","and I wasnt sure I would love the seemingly wacky prints but the colors are amazing and the prints just work.","I wore this dress for a date night but could have dressed it up with heels and jewelry or down with sandals.","I LOVE.","LOVE.","LOVE this dress and we sad to have to return it!"
"date","I am between a 4 and a 6 and I shouldve gotten the medium.","They just pulled up the crotch a little bit.","I have a normal/average waistline and flat belly.","I thought Id get the smalls because sometimes a medium can be too big.","Either way, I was able to wear the small no problem.","LOVED these.","They are a nice fabric and very chic."
"date","No bra needed for me and it held my girls up nicely.","If you were any bigger cup, Id suggest sizing up."
"date","Fit great, good style, fun pattern and fabric.","I wore it with nude heals."
"date","Dress was great for Vegas because it was super short and sexy.","Not typically the type of dress I would wear.","Great quality."
"date","."
"date","I wore this dress on a date with my husband.","He loved it.","Im petite with wide hips, and the dress fit well on the bottom.","It was loose on top especially in the back.","I kept having to pull it down.","I think its ideal for someone a little taller.","Despite all that, I still felt very sexy in it.","It was great for a night out."
"date","Ended up being a little tight, wish I had sized up.","The color is great, its more pink in person.","I got lots of compliments!"
"date","I didnt end up wearing this dress because it was way too short.","Fine if I was only going to be standing up all night long.","Granted, Im 511, so keep that in mind, but whoa.","Loved the print.","It was definitely a little boxy in the waist and tight at the hips.","Im an hour-glass-ish shape and I actually dont have a small waist, so if youre hourglass, Im not sure this would be the right choice."
"date","My first RTR experience!","Rented the dress for my first traveling Broadway experience.","Due to the date of the event and limited shipping/arrival dates, ended up having to do the 8 day rental (which I was not a fan of), but needed the dress so I settled...and it arrived a day late, disappointed.","I wanted a 10 but that wasnt available so ordered an 8 and 12.","8 was snug, too snug and 12 felt great.","Likely would  have worn the 12 over the 10 anyway.","LOVED the pockets.","Didnt need a small handbag to worry about for the event.","Perfect length, capped sleeves covered a tattoo, too.","Thicker material so even though it was a little chilly that night, I only took a cardigan to wear if needed.","Able to wear a regular bra and didnt show any straps/lines and no fussing with anything either.","Doesnt need a lot of jewelry, I only wore a watch (because I cant go without) and drop pearl earrings.","The man friend was stunned and I loved dressing up for the night.","I was so comfortable, didnt want to take the dress off.","Would definitely consider renting this one again without any hesitation."
"date","I wore this dress to the final show of Justin Timberlakes Tour in Las Vegas.","This dress fit me very well.","I could have worn it without a bra, but was able to wear it with a slightly lower plunge bra without any problems.","The dress accentuated my slim waist, and hid my full hips/ thighs nicely- and was TOTALLY comfortable all night.","I never was worried about the dress hiking up, falling down, or showing too much of anything.","I got several compliments too.","Great dress and I would rent it again."
"date","So playful!","I adore this dress completely.","You can dress this piece up, or make it super casual; I love the option of both.","It runs true to size, perfect for any bust size, and doesn’t stretch, but it was a really roomy dress so fitting it wasn’t an issue.","It is a pretty short dress, but the pattern and design makes it super appropriate no matter the occasion.","Pair it with cute booties, sneakers, or even heels and you’ll be sure to turn heads!"
"date","The dress is runs about a half size or so smaller than it says.","The dress arrived sealed with their version of a zip-tie and I had to break it to even unzip the bag.","The dress was sealed and I mean sealed in plastic so maybe it was new or newly laundered?","There were times I worried if it truly covered my rear however it seemed to go over ok with the hubby."
"date","Very flattering, sexy date night shirt.","Missing a button on the top though"
"date"," Forget about the little black dress on date night because this dress is the next best thing.","The color is amazing in person and definitely makes a statement.","This style does run true to size but would size up if you are curvier as this does have a straight cut and does not have any stretch.","The material is a little bit thicker but the small straps and tie in the back give it a lighter feel.","I am a 34DD and was comfortable in the bust area.","This should be worn with a strapless bra and one should be mindful about the length.","This dress is on the shorter side; at 5’5 it was about 4 inches above the knee.","A great pair of pearl or diamond earrings can definitely make this romantic look even more perfect."
"date","I wore this for a night out.","It leaves little to the imagination, so its definitely wise to do a few sit-ups before slipping into it!","My boyfriends eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw it, and I got a lot of compliments when I wore it a second time out.","Great color, great cut."
"date","Rented this as part of my unlimited, and I intended to wear it for one of my boyfriends work events.","However, our anniversary dinner ended up being more casual than we had initially thought, so I wore it for that instead.","Super comfortable, GREAT for petite women!","Being a shift it wasnt terribly flattering in pictures, but that is the only con.","I tend to look for things that run a bit small, because I tend closer to a 00 than a true 0.","I loved that this dress was slim enough through the sides but still fit like a shift.","Wore it with red lace pumps and simple jewelry.","Well made, cute (looked just like the pictures), and super comfortable!","It was great for a relaxing date night, and my boyfriend (who doesnt normally like shift dresses) liked it as well."
"date","It fit like a glove, and the back detailing is really stunning."
"date","perfect fit!"
"date","This dress fit like a glove, was super comfortable, and I received many complements from strangers.","Very flattering as the lace hides any imperfections.","I wore a strapless bra, but it wouldnt necessarily be needed.","Loved it!"
"date","I rented this dress as a different skirt to wear for a night out with my boyfriend who was meeting my best friends from college for the first time.","The skirt arrived and I tried on the Medium which I thought was what I would need.","It was very comfy-had a bit of stretch to it which I wasnt expecting but appreciated.","It fit my curves well, and I loved the bell at the bottom that flared out.","It looked great with black tights and heels.","It could also easily be dressed up even more for a fancier date, or dressed down for work.","I would definitely rent this skirt again."
"date","It fit like a glove, but wasnt overly tight at the bottom so it allowed me to walk comfortably.","It also wasnt that short, which was nice.","I wore this out to dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday and the waitresses and the hostess all couldnt stop asking me where it was from.","The open back was sexy but not overly sexy.","I would definitely rent this again for another party or even as a wedding guest date.","Im 59, pear shaped, 150 lb, 34C."
"date","This dress looks super cute on the RTR website and many ladies had success with this dress.","I am a full chested lady and this made the dress even shorter!","I am only 51 and did not feel comfortable with the length and unfortunately did not wear the dress."
"date","This top was perfect for a date night.","The arms run a bit tight, but the rest is true to size.","I opted to wear the smaller size as it was more flattering around my waist, even though the arms were a bit snug.","There is also a hidden zipper in the back to help you get in and out of this.","I also paired this with the layered pearl necklaces, and got a TON of compliments."
"date","Love the fit!","It was tight in the chest, but I really like that.","It was flirty without being too showy.","My first RTR dress!"
"date","I was afraid to wear this because I dont usually wear white, but the color looked incredible.","I rented this from the store in Chicago, and the size 2 was the only one they had available.","It was barely too tight, but that was understandable since Im usually a size 4.","I wore this for my 4 year anniversary date to a very nice restaurant.","This dress was beautiful and glamorous.","I wanted to keep it."
"date","My boyfriend had this sent to a friend and surprised me with this dress.","Im usually a size 4, so he ordered a 4 and 6.","The 4 was a little TOO tight for my liking.","The 6 fit like a glove.","I have a more athletic build and it was incredibly flattering.","I loved the length, neckline and color."
"date","This was a great color and I loved it off of my body.","The cut was too low for me to wear a regular bra and therefore I didnt end up wearing it."
"date","I usually wear a 0 or 2 (most of the time a 0) however after reading the reviews rented a size 2 and size 4 for backup.","I ended up wearing the 4, which fit perfectly.","I loved the dress and felt incredible.","Would definitely rent again."
"date","Fits beautifully but my dress was damaged and the lace was in bad shape with holes on it.","Even the long was almost too short for me."
"date","I could have used the XS but they only had S available.","It forced me to stand up really straight so there wasnt a bunch or extra material around my mid-section.","The material was awesome and the print was so unique...","I would rent this dress again (in the smaller size)!"
"date","fit like a glove"
"date","This dress is a knockout!","The material isnt stretchy, so dont expect it to be fitted throughout  (especially in the waist).","All the same, I received loads of compliments.","Definitely a great rental if you feel like showing some leg."
"date","Wore it out to dinner and to the theater.","I wanted something wintery, but not too fancy.","I like the that the material didnt wrinkle when seated or in my suitcase.","Fabric was thick but I didnt overheat or sweat in it.","Fit well, the lace did show.","I wore it with black tights, it didnt feel too short, was too dowdy with flats but looked good w heels.","Im 57 135lbs and 6 fit well.","Not a wowza dress, but a good classic fit and I got lots of compliments on it."
"date","Dress ran pretty true to size.","The lace is gorgeous and the color was stunning-like a burning coral!","I will say it is VERY short.","I had trouble sitting and dancing in it.","Not recommended if that is your plan..","I imagine it would not be so short on a more petite frame.","Overall, I loved this dress!","The scalloped lace neckline is also very alluring.","I felt  very beautiful in it and my boyfriend complimenting me all night!","Definitely worth renting but be prepared to show those gams!!",";)"
"date","I wore this dress for my birthday dinner and it worked perfectly.","It was the perfect length and thick enough that I did not need to wear a coat to keep warm."
"date","Loved the dress and fit.","It was exactly as expected but very short (and Im only 54)... be wary if youre tall!"
"date","I ended up wearing one size up to insure that it wasnt too tight on my hips.","The dress is rather revealing, so I wouldnt recommend it for a work function or formal event.","It was, however, a great dress for a hot date with my boyfriend (who loved it).","Depending on how it fits on your bust, I would recommend having fashion tape on hand as a back-up (just to make sure that the low cut isnt too revealing)."
"date","Perfect dress for petite"
"date","This was cute, but it hooked near the top in the front.","I dont know if it was because I have big boobs so it was stretching, but you could so see the hook so I didnt end up wearing it."
"date","Beautiful color and cut.","However, the dress is cut very small.","I sized up to a 6 and it still wouldnt fit over my hips.","I have an hourglass figure, and for others with a similar shape, size up by at least 2 sizes."
"date","I wore this on a date night with my husband to a tapas bar.","The dress has a great stretch to it that hugged all the right curves.","It was classy but flirty with the ruffled bottom - and super comfortable.","I will definitely rent this dress again."
"date","Im a 36B / normal size 6...","I ordered a 4 b/c there wasnt a 6 in stock, but it definitely pulled a little tight in the chest, so it does run true to size.","Material is lovely, details are so beautiful.","I will TOTALLY rent this again."
"date","True to many reviews, this fit true to size on my frame (petite 52 slim athletic build).","Great eye catching red and the fit helps to accentuate an hourglass silhouette.","There is little to no give in the midsection so ordering up is a safe bet.","Super comfortable yet sexy and chic dress for a special occasion night on the town."
"date","This dress is so beautiful and the quality is awesome!","The hemlines are so much fun it flows!","Proenza delivers beautiful dresses including this one!","I love it!","And the 4 fit like a glove!","My measurements 34D-25-38...","Its fitted at the waist but its comfortable and flows from the hips!"
"date","Loved this dress!","Overall, the size was a bit small.","The 6 fit, but the size up was more comfortable.","Received tons of compliments!","Would definitely recommend :)"
"date","This was a nice dress.","Very light and flowy.","I usually get Regular lengths with maxis because one of the benefits for me is wearing flat shoes with nobody being able to tell!","However, I forgot and got the long with this dress.","I wore heeled boots and a cardigan since its January and it worked out well.","I am super conscious of cleavage and the straps were a hair long so I pinned them together in the back which was fine because it was hidden by my cardigan.","Even without doing that there wasnt super cleavage - but im fairly tall so dont know how it would fit a more petite girl.","The fabric is fantastic, very luxe.","I wore it with a spiked gold necklace also rented from RTR to give it a little edge."
"date","This dress should be ordered one size up if you have hips.","The backup size 10 was too loose in the abdomen.","I did where the size 8 which was okay.","Overall, a great dress!"
"date","Cute shirt for many different occasions.","Very light-weight material & silky.","I wore with black jeans and heels out to dinner.","Because of the material it is perhaps a little dressier than your average crew neck shirt, but you can definitely dress it down or up.","Fit very true to size."
"date","I wore this dress on the Fourth of July to dinner with my husband.","I was stopped by multiple other guests at the restaurant who not only loved the dress, but said it reminded them of a firework when it moved as I walked.","If youre thin but busty, the top may be too tight.","Its perfect for someone who is pear shaped as there is plenty of room in the skirt.","Those with a small to medium chest may be able to get away with going bra-less since the neckline is high enough that it doesnt show cleavage and the flounce/ruffle over the bust hides headlights."
"date","Beautiful top for night out or date night.","Silvery blue with perfect drape and deep V-neck shape."
"date","I loved the fit, very form-fitting and unusual pattern perfect for pre-holiday season.","I received tons of compliments and wore with over the knee black suede boots."
"date","I wore this for a Valetines Day dinner date, with black tights and black pumps (and black snow boots for a while...).","I would say it runs a little big, but it still looked cute - its not fitted, but still flattering, so its good if you want a dress that can hide some flaws.","The fabric is thick and beautiful, and the flower texture is really nice.","The colors are close to the RTR picture, just a little more vibrant.","The only thing that was surprising is that the colors of the stripes are printed on, so they bleed a little past where the flowers end - its meant to be this way, and it looks fine, but I just didnt expect it.","The only reason I have this 4 stars is because the pleating around the shoulders is pretty big - I felt it was a little over-the-top, and more practically, it made it hard to wear a cardigan over the dress in the cold weather.","Overall though, a fun dress."
"date","I wore this out to a nice dinner and a show with my husband in Vegas and it was perfect.","The color is gorgeous and the shimmer isnt too overwhelming or cheesy.","Length was perfect for me, awesome since a lot of dresses end up being too short for me.","The top half was a bit tight and didnt have much give, but I blame myself for stuffing myself at dinner!","Overall Id definitely rent again."
"date","I usually wear a 0, but this 0 was a bit tight on the chest, so I ended up wearing the 2 and added a different belt.","Its romantic and super flattering.","Will rent again!"
"date","I loved the dress.","It runs really large.","I usually wear a size 4.","I ordered a size 2 as backup, ended up wearing it, and could have gone even smaller.","It was lose in the waist.","This dress is very flattering.","Makes your legs look wonderful (and shows quite a bit of them), but hides the worst parts.","It is also extremely comfortable.","I used it for a dinner and a show, and I was pleased with it.","If I wear it again I will also order a nice long necklace to wear with it.","It seems to need it to complete the look."
"date","Not too short, very cute and comfortable."
"date","Beautiful heavy material.","EXTREMELY hot in the middle because there are 4 or 5 layers of that thick, heavy material, so be ready to sweat a little.","Runs small, had to wear my back up size.","Beautiful layering, skirt flares artistically.","Doesnt really show off your curves, kind of has a life of its own."
"date","Wore this to go to a nice Valentines Day dinner with my husband.","The small and the medium fit nicely, but I went with the medium for a little more room because I knew Id be sitting most of the time as well as eating quite a bit of food.",":-)  Comfortable, stretchy just enough without getting too stretched out, and you can wear a regular, skin-toned or black bra, even with the lace on the back.","AND, I didnt have to wear Spanx to feel comfortable in it...definite plus!","Only con is the neck came right below my chin, so it would get irritating at times; and I have a pretty long neck.","So, warning, if you know you kind of have a shorter neck...it may not work for you.","The zipper in the back goes all the way up, so rolling the neck down wouldnt work.","My husband LOVED it on me, and I loved being in it."
"date","I ordered a small with a medium as a backup and wore the medium.","The material is thick enough that it is warm and hides anything  you want to hide and the waist is high enough to be able to wear tights, which was great!","Im short, so the length was great for me, hit mid thigh.","But I found that waist was way too big on the medium (my natural waist, where it hit, is 26 in), and that if there had been no sleeves, I might have tried to wear the small.","The sleeves were very tight and a little restricting on me, even in the bigger size since I have muscular arms.","While the main fabric of the dress is pretty stretchy, the lace has a lot less give.","The fact that the waist and midsection of the dress was loose was not distracting though, since it fit great everywhere else and my arms looked a lot smaller than they are with the lace!"
"date","Rented for a birthday weekend getaway.","This was my first time renting, and this was the perfect choice!","Dress did run larger than anticipated.","I wish I would have rented a size down, instead of up for my back up size, just to compare the 8 to the 10.","Overall, fantastic dress and will be renting again soon!"
"date","Classy but a great way to show off shoulders in transitional weather."
"date"," Fits true to size.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"date","Fits as described.","I had no problem with it.","It is easy to wear, comfortable yet cute."
"date","Built in bra is a plus."
"date","It is fitted, but does have a little give.","Wore it to Valentines brunch.","Love Rebecca Taylor pieces."
"date","I loved the fit of this dress!","Quality material and perfect for my body.","I wore panty hose, which ended up with a runner, but it was freezing outside which made the sacrifice a-okay lol."
"date","Such a fun top!"
"date","The knit itself is beautiful!","Even though its 100% wool, it could not be more comfortable.","I wore it with a bandeau bra as the side cleavage was a bit much.","I wore it in the fall, on a mildly chilly night, by itself, and it was comfortable warm.","So easy to wear, simple, and beautiful."
"date","I wore to Hamilton in Chicago with over the knee suede Stuart Weitzman boots.","This dress is incredibly sophisticated.","The blue/navy is such a rich color.","The top has a cool mens wear/tailored vibe with the high color and short sleeve and yet the peek-a-boo sheer fabric adds a bit of sexiness (yet it was not overly revealing).","A tiny sliver of the underside of your bra may show under the bust if you lift up your arms, but I wore with a black bra and didnt feel self conscious.","It runs a bit small because the fabric does not stretch.","I am about a 100 lbs and have a 25 waist line and fit into the 0 perfectly (which runs normally big on me) so be careful when you choose a size!","I recommend size up."
"date","This dress was so comfortable I could imagine wearing it every day!","I love the edgy flair of the leather on the skirt.","It pairs easily with accessories and can be dressed up or down, depending on your event.","This dress is perfect for Fall or Winter due to the warm fabric and long sleeves.","This is one of those outfits that is easy to throw together with little planning because this dress just pairs well with anything!"
"date","Perfectly short and sassy for a night out in Vegas with my honey!"
"date","This is a very smart looking lightweight jacket.","The stretchy panels cleverly placed on the underside of the sleeves keep the fit super snug and slimming--so thats fabulous.","On the downside for me (petite), the sleeves are a bit long so they bunched up just a touch--not as flattering or comfortable.","I wore it open over dress and it looked amazing, but due to fit I returned it after one wear.","In previous RTR leather jackets, I dont want to return them at all."
"date","I wore this dress for a day at the museum with lace leggings.","It was great for a day filled with museums and walking and this dress was cute and flirty but still airy enough for all day.","Definitely needed the leggings to make me feel a little better about the length since the dress is short."
"date","Very easy to wear."
"date","I absolutely loved this dress.","It was very forgiving and the material was thick enough to hide flaws rather than emphasize them.","I received a ton of compliments - the dress was easy to dress up or down and really comfortable.","I will definitely rent this again!"
"date","The only issues I had with it were that the boob saggy and the waist was so tight.","I think it was made for someone with huge boobs and the tiniest waist....but of course I made it work!","!"
"date","I loved this jumpsuit.","I have a ton of issues getting my thighs to fit in most jumpsuits and they totally fit in this one.","I felt like it was totally forgiving and flattering.","Loved it."
"date","I wore it under a jacket that I never took off so I didnt have to deal with a strapless bra.","The fit is the perfect middle ground between tight and flowy."
"date","I wore this dress for my birthday dinner/date night with my boyfriend and it was a rare occasion where I felt completely comfortable going bra-less!","Wonderfully made, sexy dress!","It was a bit of a squeeze although manageable getting into the 2, the main difference with the 4 (my backup) is that it had too deep of a V in the front.","This dress is obviously made to hug your figure.","Love it!"
"date","There were no cons, it was an awesome top to wear!","I loved it!"
"date","Wore it out with jeans, heels and a long sweater.","Made for an elegant but casual look."
"date","I usually wear a 4 but it was a little small so I went with the 6.","It fit like a glove and the low neckline is really flattering.","The major issue is the cutouts in the back.","When I looked in the mirror from behind I could see all the way up my thigh to the bottom of my butt.","It made me self conscious when I was walking down the street and if you have any bit of cellulite its on display."
"date","Great dress very easy to wear."
"date","Overall, amazing dress!","I run between a size 10-12.","Would have liked to have worn the 10, but it was in a little rough shape (some snags and underslip hem undone), but this way I was super comfy all evening.","This dress shows off all the curves in all the best ways.","Underslip could drop below hemline, but totally fixed with fashion tape affixing to spanx slip.","Would rent again!"
"date","I followed others advice and sized up, and Im glad I did.","The 10 fit comfortably.","The only downside is that even with a sticky bra, I really felt like this just smooshed my breasts completely flat.","That was a minor annoyance, but  this top is so cute who cares?"
"date","style ran a little small, no stretch"
"date","I didnt end up wearing this because the weather turned colder than expected, but I would rent again.","I agree with other reviews that the double zipper can make it a bit confusing to get into at first, but it improves the fit a great deal.","The dress much more body conscious and shorter than I expected, with a good flash of skin in the back.","Fortunately the muted color and short sleeves tone it down a few notches.","The fabric is thick and holds you in well - I wouldnt wear this to work but for a hot date its just the ticket!"
"date","Dress was a showstopper!","Gorgeous color!","Very fitted through the bust and waist - I sized up to a 6 was very comfortable in both areas (I normally wear a 2 or a 4).","Would highly recommend this dress!"
"date","Beautiful dress!","Fit perfectly and was very comfortable.","The size 6 I ordered, however, came in the wrong color.","It was actually purple.","Im guessing it was just extremely faded so I ended up wearing my backup size which ended up fitting the same as the size 6."
"date","The arm holes for this were too large but the rest of the top fit perfectly.","I ended up not wearing it because the fit bothered me.","Great color and beautiful top."
"date","I absolutely loved this dress!","It was perfect for a fancy dinner since I felt dressed up without being too over-the-top and showing too much skin."
"date","This dress was perfect for drinks and dinner.","It was incredibly easy to wear and looked good with several pairs of shoes (I went with nude low wedges) Looked amazing on my body and was loose enough that I could eat, drink, and not feel self conscious."
"date","the nude colored tulle-like fabric at the neckline didnt quite match my skin tone and looked odd.","the dress also ran a bit tight."
"date","The lace overlay keeps it classy and keeps the skin show in check.","Loved how comfortable and beautiful this dress was.","Lace is very soft and sturdy.","Was worried about show-through with the white, but was not an issue due to the lace overlay.","Top area was wide enough to cover everything, so Ok for gals with (perky) DD and below IMO.","Plenty of stretch to dress so fits in all the right places."
"date","Beautiful color!","Lots of compliments.","Comfortable.",":) LOVE"
"date","Ive rented from this designer before and I love the open back for dresses.","I fit into the 10 and the 12, but the 10 was a little too short for just an anniversary dinner and being 511, I opted for the 12 for the added length/coverage, even if the shoulders were a little loose.","It was such a flattering dress (even with going with the bigger size) and I received compliments from the wait staff at the restaurant and people on the street.","You know youve made it when a 10 year old boy yells to your husband that hes a lucky guy because his wife is so beautiful!","I ended up pairing this with nude heels and a few bangle bracelets.","For earrings, just simple little pearls.","As it is an open back, I could have gone bra-less but opted for sticky-boobs to help with a little lift.","Definitely plan to rent this dress again and am so happy I was able to wear this."
"date","The fit runs small.","I will order the size 8 next time."
"date","This dress is much more blue than the picture shows.","Very comfortable and cute.","I felt it was a little short for the wintertime so I put on black tights under it.","But other than that I loved it!"
"date","The color, fabric and fit were incredible.","I agree with the comments that the neck was a bit tight when I sat down, but since I wore may hair down I could undo the zipper 1/2 an inch and it was just fine.","I live in casual Colorado so dressed this down with fun casual sandals, but it could easily be dressed up as well.","Beautiful!"
"date","I wish it was available in an extra small because I really think it would have fit a little better.","Even with me feeling it was a little big it looked and felt great!","I really loved this!!!","!"
"date","The color and lace are so, so beautiful!","Its extremely comfortable and because of the lace pattern, very flattering.","It does not have any sort of compression effect, so if you have problem areas youd like to hide, this might not be the dress for you.","My husband LOVED this classy little number."
"date","I loved the material of this dress--so comfortable!","I wore it out on a date, and overheard others talk about how pretty I looked or how beautiful the dress was as I walked past.","It runs true to size, but since its a stretchy material, and very hip-hugging, I would recommend going a size up on your back up!"
"date","I shouldve read the reviews on this one more closely before renting.","Its quite heavy, to the point where its uncomfortable to move around in the dress.","The top was baggy on my frame, but Im small-chested and have narrow shoulders.","Im 53 and this dress fell at the floor, making it look formal and frumpy honestly.","I think if youre taller and going to a fall/winter event and want something covered up, this could work.","Just definitely not for me."
"date","This dress is smoking, for the zipper situation youll need to phone a friend.","I felt gorgeous, it made me look curvy and flatters my petite bust.","My night didnt go exactly as planned, but man I definitely put hot in hot mess.","Ill rent this one again!"
"date","Fits like a GLOVE, and has room in the bust for a larger chest.","The lace trim highlights shoulders and neck in a subtle, sexy way.","It arrived in great shape and is well made.","I am 57 and weigh 120 lbs and have broad shoulders and am lean and athletic but have a big chest.","This is one of my faves ever from this site."
"date","Shorts are flowy, waist band a bit tight for a medium (normally wear a small) and was able to wear without a bra due to the high neckline.","Overall a great piece for a night out or cocktail party.","Felt very comfortable all night!"
"date","I ended up choosing this dress when the original dress I picked was returned to RTR damaged.","(Customer service was amazing in getting me a new dress in time).","I saw this style and said why not?","I loved this dress.","A little flare to the typical black dress and I received so many compliments on it.","I have a larger rib cage and my midsection is not my favorite body part so Im always wary.","This dress fit like a glove - close enough to show curves but not enough to wear spanx or not drink wine (the best kind of dress right)?","I would absolutely rent it again."
"date","I wore this dress for an anniversary dinner at a nice restaurant.","As other reviews say, the black band around the waist is tight and I was worried I wouldnt even be able to zip this up.","It was a last minute rental and the only size available was a size 2 (normally I would wear a size 4).","To my surprise, I got it zipped up perfectly fine and did not find it uncomfortable-- if anything, it made me look slimmer.","The material was thick and and overall the dress looked amazing, I didnt want to take it off!"
"date","This shirt is a little much.","It was too small, maybe if it fit better I would have liked it more.","It was just ok"
"date","The quality of the dress is amazing, however there was a funky smell that didnt quite disappear even after airing it out for a day or two.","The material is thick so it might get too hot in the summer time.","The dress runs true to size but the top is pretty fitted.","If you have a small frame with a larger bust, you might want to size up."
"date","Trouble zipping the zipper over the belt feature"
"date","I wore this for an anniversary date night with my boyfriend and I totally wish I had a photo of this dress.... it was amazing!","I have an athletic build so it was a little tight on my shoulders but wasnt uncomfortable enough not to wear.","It was so sexy and classy at the same time.","Hugs all the right places... he loved it!","And so did I!"
"date","I LOVED this dress!","I was stalking the website waiting for this dress to become available again.","Finally it was.","I reserved it one size bigger than I usually wear since that was all that was available.","I thought that because it was stretchy it wouldnt matter too much.","I spent a lot of the night pulling it up so my bra wouldnt show.","But- it was so beautiful, I didnt care.","I loved it and I cant wait to get it again.","Hopefully in my size!!","!"
"date","This dress has everything.","It is a body hugging, sleek dress.","There are two zipper that allow easier access for the wearer to put it on.","The fabric stretches for movement, but I would still be exact with your sizing.","If you have a larger bust, I would size up.","I cant wait to wear this for Valentines Day!","I love this designer."
"date","I normally wear size 0, but the 0 of this dress was a little tight.","Thankfully, the size 2 backup fit perfectly!"
"date","I wore a large and it fit like a Medium.","I have hips which required additional room.","Should be ok for a slim woman with height"
"date","I loved the playfulness of the skirt.","The top fit strangely, and I have several DVF dresses so it surprised me.","I needed to wear a  tank top underneath.","It didnt just show cleavage but did so at an odd angle that seemed to show my bra no matter what I did (I tried Hollywood tape but that didnt work).","Might be a better option for flatter chested women"
"date","I wore this RTR dress to a concert, the fit is amazing....definitely shows off your curves....the skirt length was perfect, although a little hard to zip by myself, it was perfect once I got it on.","Love the royal blue/black combination, I received compliments on my dress all night long, probably because I was the only chick in a dress at a rock concert LOL"
"date","Fits true to size and drapes beautifully.","Its a little shorter than I anticipated, but it was fine with higher-waisted pants.","It can be dressed up or down (I actually wore it with very dark jeans)."
"date","Great fit, TTS, perfect length"
"date","The dress fit well and was very sexy, but I have a small butt so it constantly inched up all night.","I had to keep pulling it down or it would be all bunched up.","Overall would not wear it again, not for my body type."
"date","I wore this for a NYE dinner party, and it was perfect!","It leads itself to be really dressed up, or down, depending what you pair it with!","The pockets also made it perfect to ditch my small clutch.","I usually wear an 8 and went with the 10 since it is fitted at the waist.","Overall very comfortable!"
"date","I LOVED this dress!","So classy and beautiful.","Think along the lines of Kate Middleton style.","The one thing I noted is this dress has a built in corset and it got sort of uncomfortable after eating and sitting down for a play.","It wasnt so tight that I wanted to take if off immediately but It was noticeable.","It made the fit look amazing though!"
"date","This was an ok, not great rental.","It served its purpose and gave me a little warmth on a date night.","The jacket does run small though.","Im a size 12, flat tummy, d cup bra.","I ordered the large and it did not look right when I tried to close it so I wore open all night."
"date","I ordered this dress for a wedding where I wanted to dress very modestly but ended up wearing my backup dress instead.","So I wore this one out to dinner - with its jersey fabric and laid-back shape, I think its more appropriate for a more casual occasion like a date than for a wedding anyway.","The color is great for fall/winter, and the shape was super flattering.","I wore it with a long necklace to dress up the simple front."
"date","Gorgeous!","Fits like a glove - true to size.","Stunning piece1"
"date","The dress does fit slightly small; for me it was noticeable around the arms area (slightly tight there) - but I have relatively broad shoulders and strong arms so I was in no way surprised.","The zipper is a little sticky, but once on the dress is SO beautiful and SO comfortable.","I wore it to a birthday dinner and was comfortable even after a bottle of wine, and everyone in the restaurant complimented the dress.","It is a beautiful rose gold (altho it appears more true gold in photos) and the lining is thick, beautiful, and comfortable.","Astounded by how simple and easy the entire process was, and the thrill of getting fancy for a night.","Looking forward to my next RTR opportunity :)"
"date","It such a great dress to wear, it fit perfect."
"date","LOVED THIS TOP!","I normally dont wear off shoulder tops because I feel like my shoulders look broad.","But this top was so flattering on me!","It does run super small, I typically wear a size small even an XS sometimes.","Size up for primary and backup to be safe!","Definitely going to rent this for date night!"
"date","This dress is cute online but in person the material is shiny with more bold stripes and NO STRECH at all.","To the point where I was unable to move or sit down in this dress.","I was going to wear it to dinner with my fiance and his family, but there was no way it would would work.","If youre interested in this dress Id say order at least 2 sizes larger.","But even then, since theres no stretch, it might hang and bag."
"date","Wore out on an evening date.","Loved that you can wrap the dress in both directions.","The fabric is thick and the dress was very comfortable.","The shoulders are slightly padded which I could have done without but it didnt look bad.","The overall look was slimming.","A great dress if you want comfort and an LBD thats a little different."
"date","Im 52 and very petite.","I thought this dress fit perfectly and fell at the right length!","I wore it to Per Se in NYC for my birthday dinner.","Pairs nicely with nude heels :)"
"date","This dress was very short.","I wore this with long leggings because it fit more like a shirt than a dress.","The dress looks very cute online, but the quality of the materialis not that impressive.","I would not rent this for a formal event.","I used it for a regular date night or night on the town."
"date","Super cute and classy design, especially the scalloped top.","I wore it for our date night at the symphony during the holidays and it was PERFECT.","The pockets are a plus, too.","Im usually a size 0, but I sized up based on the previous reviews and am very happy that I did -- it fit me like a glove.","As others have said, theres not much room for moving your arms above your head so I might hold off on wearing this to an event that involves dancing."
"date","It was great for a very nice dinner date.","I was pleasantly surprised about the main color being more pink then red.","It was light to wear on a humid evening.","Was not tight any where.","It fir like a glove."
"date","The zipper was difficult to use and the straps were a little long and kept slipping off my shoulders.","It also showed more cleavage than I expected and Im only a 34B.","Nice dress, but wasnt as cute as I expected.","The material was also really thick and not comfortable."
"date","I wore this for a couple of evenings out during a vacation.","Overall it was a great option, but wrinkled a lot, so I wouldnt recommend for traveling.","The waist is very fitted.","The faux nude back made it so you could wear a normal bra.","Highly recommend!"
"date","If youre tall like me,You can get away with normal or tall length.","DrapesBeatifully, classic and easily dressed up with jewelry.","Received so many compliments!","Loved this!"
"date","I wore this out for my boyfriends birthday.","While it was a little tighter than other Elizabeth & James dresses Ive worn, it still fit and was comfortable.","It is on the short side, but since the dress also has a cut out in the middle, I think anyone who rents this probably doesnt mind showing some skin.",";-) Great for a date, white party, bachelorette party, etc."
"date","too large, but the color is amazing and the cut is flattering!"
"date","This dress was made for my body.","Important note: its purple --like my phone case.","A racerback bra doesnt work well, so I would recommend a strapless or none at all.","The dress hugs every curve and is supremely flattering.","If you want to show off your shoulders, waist and butt, this is the dress for you.","The back cut-out on me showed only a sliver of skin, but I am short in the torso.","I would say there is some stretch in the fabric.","I attempted to find it online to purchase it, but no dice.","Ill just rent it again!"
"date","If youre going to rent this dress, keep in mind that when it is on...it looks more like the review pictures than the model pics.","In fact, if you want the loose fit (which I did), you should size up.","The problem there, is that the top hangs down too much.","It was kind of a bummer, I loved the way it looks on the model, but it was an awkward cut on me.","I usually wear a 6 in Tibi dresses, no problem."
"date","After renting but not being able to wear other HL dresses, I was nervous for this pick.","However, I ended up being blown away by how much better this dress looked than comparable LBDs.","The material hugged my curves without being too tight to continue wearing after dinner, and remained form fitting yet comfortable even after dancing all night long - truly a standout dress!"
"date","This top is a lovely color and fabric.","Its just so large  the sizing is really off.","I got it in my normal size, but it fits like its one or even two sizes too large around the chest.","I have a small rib cage, and wish I wouldve gotten a size zero.","I dont have a small bust (34C), but the size 4 was still gaping."
"date","I rented this dress for my anniversary.","We went to brunch in the morning and a nice dinner in the evening.","It worked for day time with flats but also dressed up for dinner with heels and jewelry.","My husband loved it and I got a ton of compliments from strangers.","Fit was good for a large bust."
"date","Super cute shirt - love the lace and little collar combo but it ran too small in the arms to be able to wear comfortably.","Would recommend going up a size."
"date","This dress was adorable, but not the most comfortable.","I am 58 and I wore a 6, and it was extremely difficult to sit down.","Luckily I was on the side of the table facing the wall and no one could see anything.","It is extremely neon pink, which I didnt mind, but prepare to be surprised.","The material is forgiving, but the arms can be a bit tight.","I received a ton of compliments!"
"date","The cut of this blazer is a great update to a typical black number.","It felt a little tight through the shoulders but it did not keep me from wearing it, and I think that this style blazer is supposed to fit a tad small.","It is definitely a  more tailored look.","I wore it over a sleeveless summer dress and dark skinny jeans with a tall black heeled boot.","It was a great way to take one of my favorite summer dresses into winter.","If it had been slightly larger I would have contemplated purchasing it, I loved the style that much!"
"date","This dress fit like a glove and the back is absolutely gorgeous.","I felt like a princess in this dress and will definitely be renting again!","Very elegant for formal events"
"date","nice sweater"
"date","This dress is tight on the arms.","But beautiful and classy.","Looks great paired with nude pumps and a statement necklace."
"date","I loved the way this dress hugged my body - the fabric is quite heavy and has a lot of stretch to it.","As soon as we walked in the door of the restaurant, I started getting compliments.","I wore this dress with high black suede shooties that made my legs look a million miles long.","The shoulders were a bit too narrow for me, but I have freakishly wide shoulders that are a full size larger than the rest of my body.","Still, I loved the dress and felt super cute in it.","Did not have a chance to snap a pic as we were running late, but this dress made my waist look tiny and showed off the hard work I put into my abs!"
"date","a little big for a medium but great quality and can be dressed up or down"
"date","Got so many compliments on it!","Loved wearing it!"
"date","The pros are this dress is eye-catching with the beautiful bright blue and the funky cool cut outs twist on the bandage dress.","However, it is very low-cut in the front and with more than an A/B cup you will definitely be putting on a show.","Also the dress is extremely heavy.","I chose not to take it to the Bahamas because my luggage was already overweight ...seriously this is a very heavy dress but I did not notice it while I was actually wearing it.","Loved it & lots of compliments!","No bra needed or maybe just petals/covers."
"date","I normally wear a 6, but the 4 was just right.","This dress is beautiful!","It is very flattering, but like other reviews, I agree the stomach area is a little loose and almost poufy.","Very comfortable to wear all night!"
"date","I waited too long to rent a dress for a swanky New Years Day dinner at a top Philly restaurant.","I passed this dress by several times, then rented in desperation.","So glad I did!","Very elegant, comfortable and warm in winter weather.","Slimming, yet plenty of room in waist to mask the post-holiday bloat.","And the short/long hemline was stylish, not 70s disco flashback.","I wore navy suede pumps and a statement necklace (not in photo) to jazz up neckline.","Ended up very Audrey Hepburn.","Dont pass this dress by!"
"date","My only complaint was it was a little tight in the chest."
"date","I usually wear a size 8 suit jacket, but this ran a bit smaller than that.","Sleeves are fitted and I didnt zip it.","I wore it to work with fitted cropped dress pants and heals and then wore it on the weekend with jeans and heals.","Looked amazing both ways!","The mix of the print and the cut is modern and really cute.","I got so many compliments on it!"
"date","I loved the red detail because I could wear red tights to help it pop out.","I couldnt find my black heels, but I think it looked good with black flats (though, I would have preferred the heels).","It was easy to walk and sit in.","I couldnt wear a bra with it because the back was a little low, but the top fit just right that it didnt matter too much."
"date","I wore this for a dinner date for my husbands birthday.","I was 3 months pregnant.","Not pregnant, I would have chosen a small, but since I hadnt gained much weight, I ordered the small and the medium.","The small was an awesome bodycon fit even around my clearly pregnant belly (this is my third baby, so theres no hiding it).","The medium fit well too, but it was a little loose around the chest, which might have been because of the way it fit around my belly.","I dont normally go for sequins, but in the low light of the restaurant it was subdued.","I loved the many shades of blue in the sequins.","Its hard to see in the pictures, but it was lovely!","I wish I would have remembered to take a picture..."
"date","snug at the waist"
"date","I wore this to see Hamilton with the boy and we turned it into a full on mid-week date night.","The jumpsuit was amazingly easy to wear - I felt sufficiently dressed up for our special evening, but not too dressy for what was still a Tuesday night.","The material is thick and flattering so it was easy to go bra-less to accommodate the open back."
"date","I thought this would be a fun dress for a night out but it definitely looked more casual in person.","It was ok, but I didnt love it."
"date","I got the small and the medium, and both fit well, its just about how tight or loose you prefer the fabric to be."
"date","Luckily, my first choice dress was unavailable, and I received this one which was my upgraded style.","I felt so pretty in this dress and decided to wear it with my black strappy pumps vs. the nude pumps.","I posted both pictures.","The only reason I knocked off one star is because some of the flowers were folded over, and I felt the hemline was a little long.","Overall, I would highly recommend renting this dress."
"date","I wore the small to make sure the top fit well.","Its low cut and the medium had to much gappage (is that a word?)","under the arms.","Its a short dress either way but wearing the short made it extra short.","I didnt feel uncomfortable though.","The cool thing about the neckline is that there are hook-and-eyes, so you can make the dress more or less revealing.","Love the pockets.","Its a very flattering dress.","Cant wear a regular bra."
"date","This was my annual free birthday rental dress and was only chosen because the selection was meager.","That being said, I found this dress to be perfect for the three digit heat here in Oklahoma!","It felt very lightweight and the color combination was very chic.","It is very tiny though!","I fit into the size 0 but after eating dinner and picking at my sorbetto, it was feeling tight in the waist.","There was zero give so if you rent, plan to go hungry or size up.","And kudos to RTR and its reusable packaging!","Love it!"
"date","This was a nice dress that, with some effort, could be dressed down.","Thick and luxurious quality fabric kept me cozy on a 60 degree evening downtown to eat all the food.","Im 510, teeter between a size 10 & 12, and prefer a 33 inseam - you can see in photos where the hemline fell on me - the perfect playful length for date night or work.","This dress was roomy without being baggy - perfect fit, honestly!"
"date","Ive never worn a backless dress before, but the front was very me, and it was the 3-for-1 Valentines promo, so I went for it, and I ended up wearing it instead of my first choice.","It was very comfortable to wear and easy to take on and off (though the sequins will scratch you when you pull it on if youre not careful--theres no zipper; you just pull it over your head).","I loved the colors of white and silver and the slashy kind of pattern they made.","I paired it with beige/nude heels.","Really loved this dress overall!"
"date","Amazing emerald color, loved the extra long options.","I ordered the 12L as my backup but the previous renter damaged it so much, Jessica from RTR customer service emailed me and sent me a different dress as a backup.","I didnt end up needing it but the service was excellent!"
"date","The dress fit much longer than I imagined, which is good, as it looked too short for my taste.","Its very casual.","The fabric is heavy.","Only drawback is the armholes are really big.","I should have gotten a small, but just wore a bralette under instead.","I wore mine with tights and boots."
"date","Looks very expensive and fits like perfection.","Just the right amount of skin.","Wore it to Valentines Day dinner and just loved it."
"date","It ran really big.","I wore the medium and I still felt like I was wearing a moo-moo.","It was comfortable, but I had to readjust the shoulder a lot.","I wouldnt recommend it."
"date","Fit and cut are good.","It looks short on the model, but I think she must be particularly tall.","Im 55 and it hit like 2-3 above the knee.","Its a thick texture and fairly warm, so I wouldnt recommend it in summer.","But for fall its great!"
"date","This top was great for a Friday night out - it definitely runs small but I think it is meant to be very tight in order to stay up on your shoulders.","Not a lot of breathing room, but very flattering!","Would rent again"
"date","Pretty color and lace detail.","Was a little tight around the waist but overall was comfortable to wear.","Loved the pockets!"
"date","This was the first Joie shirt Id ever worn and I was in love immediately.","I love the soft, loose fit, but it still had enough structure to look designer.","The pattern was cute.","I wore it on a date with skinny jeans, ballet flats, and a black Kate Spade bag.","I felt so cute and flirty.","I rented it in the fall, when it was pretty cool outside.","I would rent it again, but wouldnt wear it during the summer if youre going to be outside a lot because it is white and the material seems like it would show sweat easily."
"date","Fit was somewhat tight in the ribcage, but overall comfortable.","It has a pretty look, and not too much sparkle in the black!"
"date","It has just enough give to be comfy while showing off curves."
"date","The dress was very cute and Great Gatsby-esque.","I received a number of compliments about how cute the dress was.","It was very short and the cut or pattern on it made me look a little hippy, but it was still a really nice dress and looked good."
"date","Beautiful color and great fit all over except I couldnt wear it because it was too long (but I am very short) and jumpsuits just might not be something I can rent."
"date","Unable to wear it….way too big."
"date","This dress is beautiful.","Fits like a glove and I felt so pretty in it.","I rented it for our second anniversary dinner and it was a huge hit.","I will definitely rent it again."
"date","First, overall, this is an incredibly sexy but classy jumpsuit.","I wore it out in New Orleans over New Years weekend, and not only did my husband love it, but several women spontaneously commented on how much they loved it when we were out.","The back of this jumpsuit is what makes it spectacular.","The outfit was comfortable (though a bit snug in places due to limited sizing available - more on that below) and made me feel very chic.","I highly recommend it.","I may even rent it again, in one size up.","As for that:I wore the 10L (6L in US sizing), and though it worked, at the tail end of the holidays a size up would have been better, but the next size up wasnt available.","The 10L was a bit tighter through the thighs than I would have preferred.","Also, I have a longer torso, so the neck strap was a bit more snug than I would have liked pulling down on my shoulder.","I tried on the 10R, but even as a 57 woman, it looked a bit like high waters - no good.","You want the long line for this look to really sing, so if youre 57 or above, definitely go for the L sizing (particularly if you want to wear heels)."
"date","I love this dress, i want to buy it!","So flattering, though it runs large.","It is very long, Im 52 and wore 4 inch wedges and I still had to pull it up when walking at times."
"date","I rented this dress last year for our rehearsal dinner, then again for a 1st anniversary night out.","I still love it!","So form fitting, especially for a curvy, petite person, with tummy problems like myself!","No need for spanx, this does the job, all on its own!!","I love, LOVE, Nicole Miller dresses and this one does not disappoint!","Perfect date night dress!","I would definitely recommend it!"
"date","Very comfortable fit.","A little short and I felt like I had to hold onto it to keep it from blowing up in a breeze."
"date","Loved this!","I ordered the size 2 and back up size 4.","Size 4 never came out of the plastic since size 2 was a perfect fit.","Im 54, 125#, athletic/muscular build.","I loved the deeper cut top and fitted waistline.","The low cut made it a bit sexy, but the length kept it classy.","The material was quality made.","Photos dont do this dress justice as far as the vibrant color of the pink.","I wore this for a date night with my husband and it was so awesome.","Loved this dress."
"date","Fit perfectly and was so comfortable.","The neck line did lay a little funny, but overall it was great!"
"date","I rented this for a casual date weekend, and it was perfect for dinner and cocktails on a hot evening in LA.","Im 52 and was able to wear it with flat sandals, although I could have worn it with wedges as well.","I usually wear from an 8-10 in fitted dresses (the other dress I rented this weekend was a 10),  and I actually think I could have sized down to a SR in this dress.","It was incredibly comfortable - I went without a bra or Spanx, just wearing regular undies (the dress is lined to the mid-thigh, so I was able to wear black undies without worrying they would show through) - and felt chic for the restaurant and bars we went to.","I thought there would be black accents in the dress, but its all shades of coral, white/cream, and navy...so keep that in mind when accessorizing.","This would be a good choice for anyone with a tummy (like me) or who is in their first 2 trimesters of pregnancy."
"date","Loved the pattern!","Comfortable and fun for a date night/birthday celebration.","The skirt was poofier than I expected but not crazy big.","Wore a 6 but was a little loose in the torso/bust area.","Could have probably sized down if Id had a 4.","Fabric is thicker and more structured.","Able to wear a normal bra which is always a plus."
"date","I ordered this dress as part of my unlimited subscription for a date with my husband.","I really liked the feel and flow of the material.","It is light and airy - perfect for summer.","The blue on the dress really popped, also.","However, the dress didnt fit me as well as some of my other RTR choices.","I think if I had ordered a size down I would have felt more comfortable.","I liked the material, color, and length so much I may try it again some time in a smaller size."
"date","This was a fun and easy dress to wear.","It didnt seem as short on me as it does the model and Im of average height.","It seems to fit mainly true to size, although did seem a little tight in the bust but loose in the hips on me.","I would size up or down for the second size as accordingly.","I had planned on packing this dress for an out of town event but it arrived fairly wrinkled and I dont believe this fabric would travel well.","The wrinkles came out enough with a steamer so I could wear it out on a date before I left for my trip.","Also, I think other reviews stated it showed everything underneath.","It is fully lined, so I do think its accommodating of basic undergarments, but I would recommend spanx for a sleek fit."
"date","fir great and cute cut"
"date","This romper is comfortable and can be dressed up or down.","The shorts portion is a little large if you have a smaller bottom, but not unflatteringly so, because the waist is quite small.","In person I couldnt actually tell if the lace on top was black or navy, but it looks good either way."
"date","The boning on the inside is a real problem.","Its extremely pointy and digs into your sides, and eventually tore through the lining.","I had to put duct tape on the inside to keep them from cutting my skin, which got old real fast.","Overall, get this is if youre willing to suffer a bit for beauty."
"date","I cant say enough wonderful things about this dress.","I loved it so much that I was really tempted to keep it.","But, I didnt.","I used this dress for date night, but I think with the right jacket and a different pair of shoes it would be good for the office as well."
"date","I had to wear the large versus medium because I waited too late.","Print it colorful and very pretty.","The material is thick but in no way uncomfortable, great for winter or cool night events.","I wore with black tights and black high heeled boots and got TONS of compliments.","Dress was a little big for me, but perfect for the event!"
"date","Im typically a 4 but sometimes a 2 or 6.","It didnt fall right.","Will possibly retry in a small."
"date","Loved this dress!","Perfect for a romantic date night.","The color, the lace and the fit was very flattering.","The dress was true to size but I would highly recommend going a size up for back-up as the lace sleeves were very snug on my arms."
"date","I loved this dress, especially the pattern and the length.","I am only 52 so many dresses are longer on me than they are meant to be, but this one was a great length -- not to long, but not too short.","The only criticism I had was that since I like my dresses to be more snug, the back v-cut puckered a little bit.","The back clasp was also a little cheap looking -- it was different on the size 2 and the size 4, so I imagine that it needed to be replaced on one of the dresses."
"date","Very tight in arms, I did get my 32DD in that bad boy, but no bra.","Material was a little...scratchy.","but this was so sweet and even sexy."
"date","Such an airy and feminine style for the summer!","This Yumi Kim wrap dress is truly the ultimate maxi.","The dress is larger in the bust and has a deep V so I would recommend sizing down if you have a smaller bust.","It is also loosely fitted in the waist (can be adjusted by tying it more loosely or tightly) and not fitted at all in the hips which makes it comfortable and much easier to size.","It also does run on the longer side so I wouldnt recommend it if you are petite!"
"date","the dress was great.","fitted through the lower half.","the top was structured but loose so it had a good balance.","i also loved the neckline that highlighted the collar bones."
"date","I got a lot of,compliments."
"date","The fabric is amazing in every way - unique print and high quality weaving - almost tapestry-like.","Im 54 inches and it is still very short on me.","To the point where if I dropped something I would def not bend down to pick it up!","With tights it was daytime-to-date appropriate though, and I got SO many compliments.","Note that it does restrict arm movement somewhat, so reaching up creates the same situation as bending over - youll flash everyone in the near vicinity.","Overall love it and will rent again."
"date","While standing the fit was fine but when sitting down, it was too tight on the hip area (so it would rise up, not a pretty look), so if  you have wide  hips like I do, I dont recommend it.","Its a beautiful dress but it has seen better days and the dresses I received should not be put for rent anymore.","I have rented other dresses and I hadnt received a worn out dress such as this one, so this was disappointing.","I didnt return it because I didnt have any other dress as I was on vacation, and I needed it for the same day when I picked it up (and was short on time).","Gave it 3 stars since it was a cold day and I wore it with a long grey coat which pretty much hid it and it pictures ok, although it looks wrinkly from the bottom - and I carefully ironed it prior to wearing it.","I would not rent this dress again."
"date","This dress could not be more comfortable!","The scuba like material makes is a dream to wear all night and the cut outs give it that extra little something for date night, or a night out with the girls!","The color is even more vibrant in person and it works great with a summer tan.","The material is very fitted, but hugs in all the right places and is quite forgiving."
"date","Ive worn Tracy Reese before and was comfortable choosing a size 10.","Unfortunately it was all wrong.","The bottom was too tight and the top was too big (it bunched).","Its too bad too because the dress is beautiful.","The detail shimmers and the bow accent on the back is fantastic."
"date","Very flattering fit - great pattern and the back is awesome!"
"date","True to size but short and form fitting.","Material is thick so it hides flaws.","Many compliments."
"date","The fit was perfect :) Since its a non-maternity dress, I was worried, but it had just enough stretch to work with my big baby bump.","I wore it for my birthday dinner with my hubby, and Im so so glad I rented it.","I wished I had it for all of my holiday events!","I would def rent this again when Im not pregnant, but it made me feel especially good while pregnant!","Note that I was 8 months pregnant at the time, 20 pounds gained, 34D bust (different measurements than my normal profile ;)!)"
"date","This dress is really cute, especially with out the outer blouse.","I think think dress would look the best on someone with a straight and narrow shape or a thin athletic build, on me it just looked bulky and strange."
"date","Perfect dress for an important date with my love!","I felt like a billion bucks and my hubs was very complimentary.","The fit - Im athletic with no waist and no boobs.","This dress gave me a waist and made my girls look great!"
"date","Im 57 and this dress is VERY short....","I couldnt bend over but was determined to wear it as a dress b/c I wasnt feeling leggings or jeans.","If it was a couple of inches longer, it would be so cute.","Perfect for the petite ladies out there!"
"date","Comfortable and forgiving, this little black dress had just that extra something with the cross-body ruffle.","It worked great from work meetings to the symphony in style.","The fabric is a good weight for fall, some great earrings and a pair of heels, and the outfit is made."
"date","I rented this dress for a dinner date; when I got it on the cut was flattering enough but there were tons of zippers and other odd details that were hard to see online.","I ended up not wearing it because I felt like St. Pepper and it wasnt comfortable... very heavy fabric.","From afar the styling was very flattering with the color blocking."
"date","I wore this to a gallery crawl and I blended in with the art, it was perfect.","It also translates nicely between day and night but its quite short so keep that in mind.","People stopped me on the street to ask about it, its very original and has to be worn by someone with personality."
"date","I wore this for birthday dinner.","I was nervous about wearing leather at first but the material is gorgeous and the top is sexy while still looking classy.","I thought the fit was perfect and loved the shape of it.","The neckline was plunging without being risque.","Wish I could buy!"
"date","It fit great!","Very surprisingly comfortable."
"date","This was the perfect late summer dress.","I wore it out on a date night with my husband to a broadway show.","Paired it with some super high heels to dress it up a bit (this dress would be a perfect office dress as well, paired with a cardigan).","Super cute and very slimming!"
"date","I wore this for a date, and it was the perfect jumpsuit!"
"date","I rented this shirt for a date night.","I loved the idea of this shirt!","It was a little large and I would definitely have sized down in the future.","The style was super cute but I had to steam the bow because it was a little wrinkled when I got it in the mail.","Overall, it was super cute and flattering!","Definitely worth renting"
"date","I wore this dress for a Valentines Day dinner, and it was perfect.","Im between a 6 and an 8, and wore the 8.","The 6 zipped but was way too tight across the chest.","I dont have a large chest, but I do have somewhat broad shoulders.","The 8 was a perfect fit.","Its a little hard to tell in the photos on the website, but this dress has a lace overlay.","Its very pretty and the sleeve detail looks great on.","I would definitely recommend this dress - it would be great for a wedding!"
"date","This dress was gorgeous all around.","I wish I had rented the size 0 because the 2 was a little loose on me.","If you have a small chest order down since it will be hard to keep the straps up, even with the corset thats included.","I needed to wear a backless strapless bra just for peace of mind.","The color glowed and was perfect for a summer night out.","It was a comfortable dress, not too long, roomy enough in the hips.","I would rent again."
"date","Got lots of compliments!"
"date","I wear a 6 usually, but the 4 fit better.","It hugged me just right without being tight or showy.","However, if I had any bigger breasts, they would have been flattened.","I felt gorgeous, I could move easily in the dress and it made me feel so classy.","I love this dress!!","I kind of want to buy it for myself.","I would wear it again and again."
"date","WANT THIS!","My husband even commented on how much he liked it.","Can only hope this becomes available when they have their sale here.","The color, the repeating sheer panels, the fit.","Love it all.","Moves with you really well.","Perfect to dress up a casual night and make you stand out."
"date","PRO: Amazing fit.","Reliable Hervé heavy fabric that holds you in.","Fine to wear with a regular strapped bra.","CON: The fabric across the chest is flappy, it seems to have been stretched out a lot and quite worn."
"date","Very comfortable and slimming."
"date","This top is absolutely adorable.","I wore it with a strapless bra.","Because I am a 30 D, I had to fidget with the ruching part the whole night to make sure it was staying in place.","I loved this top but would probably not rent again because of my bust size.","Other than that, great for petites."
"date","Great dress--one of my favorites!","Flattering, comfortable, fun, standout, but also formal enough for a cocktail outing."
"date","The dress was exactly what I expected-true to size, classy but fun and flirty with the waistline cutouts!","The fabric is a little stiffer than it looks (not much give), but when I steamed out the wrinkles, that gave it a little extra flow.","The zipper is tricky around the middle, so be careful.","The pockets were a great touch!"
"date","Oh how much I loved this piece!","I wanted to keep it so bad.","Wore it for a date night and it fit like a glove!","The fabric has some nice weight to it, but it doesnt make it too hot for warmer months.","The back has a cut out but you can still wear a normal bra with it.","(Big +++ for me, since I cant ever go braless.)","The dress is a really dark ink color.","Not truly navy.","Cant wait to rent this again!"
"date","The scuba material Clover Canyon uses is the bomb-dot-com.","It sucks things in and holds things tight.","No Spanx needed.The length of the skirt is perfect to balance out the mid-riff opening.","Very sexy.","The mix of patterns, florals and color block is a great idea.","However, the seam along the butt was askew and rather noticeable IMHO.","This dress is perfect for date night."
"date","I rented this for a fancy date night and loved it.","It runs large, so if youre between sizes you should definitely size down.","My one complaint is that the straps are not adjustable.","Other than that- very comfortable and breezy, beautiful pattern and very well made."
"date","Very flattering and slimming fit.","Beautiful lace details."
"date","I wore this dress for a date to a vineyard with my husband.","It was perfect!","You can dress it up or down so it is very versatile.","The dress fit like a glove.","With every other RTR dress there have been aspects Ive loved and other parts that I havent liked as much.","I loved everything about this dress.","It was supportive enough that I could have gone braless, but I opted to wear it with one of my regular bras that has convertible straps.","I will absolutely rent this dress again."
"date","The color was even more beautiful in person than online.","I really loved the dress and I got toooons of compliments on it.","The dress I got was in ok shape--no tears or funky smells.","One thing to note for the bustier babes.","I was expecting to wear a low-back bra and realized after I tried it on that I couldnt.","The straps were the culprit--they showed in the diamond cut out.","Luckily I had some stick-ons with me.","Just a note, but didnt really take away from the experience.","I wore it with some huge dangly earrings and curly hair and a black pump.","Was perfect for my fancy date night.","good luck!"
"date","Unfortunately this did not fit in the bust for me (DD).","It was the perfect length with 3.5 inch heels.","The color is a beautiful, modern blush.","It is thin fabric as others have mentioned.","Definitely perfect for a full B or C cup.","The belt was included in the order.","The cut is very forgiving for ladies with larger bottoms and legs.","I wish it would have fit...I had ordered it for a Valentines date."
"date","Ended up going with the smaller size, it runs large even for a boxier fit.","I didnt mind that it was short but beware, Im 55 and it was a bit windy that night so I had to hold it down when we were walking outside.","The dress was super comfortable and easy!"
"date","I really liked this dress and found it very flattering for my birthday date night.","I thought it would be slightly more playful in that the skirt would have been a bit more poofy, but as you can see from the picture that is not what happened when I wore it.","The dress had a bit of weight to it, was of high quality, and fit very well.","I decided not to wear a necklace with it because the top already had so much going on so if you rent it I suggest wearing great shoes & bangles to make the dress really pop!"
"date","Pros: this is a great dress if you have a flawless figureCons: It can be hugging in the stomach area."
"date","Fit was perfect.","Loved the stripes and very slimming.","You wont be disappointed with this one!"
"date","Love the lace detail on this top.","I rented it as part of my unlimited subscription while I was pregnant, and it was perfect for date nights.","Id definitely consider renting it again now (that Im not pregnant), and will go back down to my regular size in Rebecca Taylor (6 or 8)."
"date","Need to be comfortable with showing cleavage.","Very comfortable giving fabric.","Color was beautiful.","Will rent again."
"date","The fit was as expected.","Very comfortable."
"date","Im 61 so finding a dress that is long enough is pretty tricky.","The length of this dress was just above my knees (perfect), but the fit was ALL WRONG.","This was my first time using RTR and I didnt know which direction I should have gone with my rental...thought better air on the side of caution and rent UP.","I rented the 20W.","The dress fit ok through my hips, but was WAY TOO BAGGY in my chest which I thought was strange because I am a 38D.","The color is pretty, more blue than white as the background color.","Overall, I would not recommend getting this dress."
"date","The dress is made of a very thick material.","It fits very snugly but shows off those curves!","It was mid-thigh length on me."
"date","This shirt is a heavy material and has a really fun pattern.","Its great for events or a night out."
"date","I rented this as a back up dress and did not wear it.","The fabric is thin, and this gives it an everyday casual feel.","Also was not available in my size so the tight fabric was even less forgiving."
"date","Overall a fantastic top!","I would recommend this for a date night or night out on the town.","I wore this for a girls night and paired with black ponte knit leggings and black booties, but it would also look great with black strappy heels.","I also loved the detail the bell sleeves on this kimono top!","Its a very well made top overall.","I saw a few reviews that the there was a lot of fabric with the part that you tie, but I thought it was fine."
"date","I wore this on a date, to work (with a black long sleeve shirt under it), for a casual day, etc.","Very comfortable and spring timey!"
"date","I loved this dress so much I wore it twice.","Once for work and once for fun.","It ran a bit small and so there was a small gap in the chest area between buttons, but otherwise I really liked it.","To resolve the gap issue, I allowed the sash from the collar to cover the button line."
"date","loved it, no stretch, but loose enough that it didnt matter"
"everyday","I rented it for everyday wear and it was great.","Wrinkles easily though but still enjoyed it."
"everyday","Unfortunately this was way too big all around.","The length could have worked with heels but the body of the dress and the chest were massive"
"everyday","I find myseld to be a true size 6.","However this dress was very snug.","Very cute though."
"everyday"," So Soft.","Love the button snaps for closure.","Surprise interior of the coat.","Turns out the coat is reversible!","The coat wears best for me on the dark blue fluffy side, but I loved seeing the turn open at the top to show off the shiny side."
"everyday","I loved this, very Olivia Pope(esque).","The quality was a little thinner than I would have expected, but it looked wonderful."
"everyday","This dress was very unique and fit true to size.","Material does stretch but does not return to original position very well so it looks worn at the end of the day."
"everyday","Love the scuba material and the jacket was true to size, although the mesh sleeves seemed to be slightly tight.","Otherwise a great and versatile piece!"
"everyday","Tight waist an bust."
"everyday","The front zipper is a lot of fun, it fit perfectly and was really cute.","The only negative is that I couldnt tell if the dark stripes were navy or black."
"everyday","I love this dress!","It runs small so I was not able to wear it BUT will rent again in a larger size!","Love the cut, color and charisma of this little dress!","Perfect for the office, afternoon party or a date!!","Rent this dress it is fun!"
"everyday","This is one of those shirts that hangs perfectly and makes you look great without being fussy at all.","I wore it to work with jeans and people loved it."
"everyday","I loved the fit of this romper!","Rant true to size.","I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the difficulty getting it zipped and unzipped to go to the bathroom.","Probably wouldnt wear it to an all day/night drinking event for that reason alone"
"everyday","This dress just slips over your head and falls into place.","Very comfortable.","As others mentioned it is a bit heavy so not for a real hot summer day.","I wore it to church and it was good in the airconditioning."
"everyday","Fit perfectly!","Got so many compliments on this romper.","Love the material.","Definitely rent again"
"everyday","It was just a little too big but I would try the same in a smaller size"
"everyday","I wanted to love this top.","When I looked at it on the hanger, my first impression was that it was going to be really short.","It actually fit great and stayed up all day.","Only problem is that I couldnt actually wear it out of the house.","There are two vertical seams down the front of this top.","Its sort of open stitching.","Very cute design but you have to have a black strapless bra to make it work.","Otherwise you will be baring it all."
"everyday","I wore this dress to work and got many compliments on it, the only negative I would say is the zipper up the back is so itchy!","The bottom part of the zipper especially, but the dress fit my curves perfectly!","Great dress for work."
"everyday","I have rented probably 20 or so items from RTR and this has by far been one of my favorites!","I wore it to a golf tournament and got so many compliments!","The cut out in the back is super cute and the colors are perfect for summer.","Would totally recommended!"
"everyday","I think this top is great for all seasons.","I wore it with distressed jeans and booties and it was perfect for out to lunch.","I think it could be cute with cigarette pants and heels too.","I got a ton of compliments on it and will definitely rent it again."
"everyday","It was a great outfit for a hot day.","A little short, but it fit loose so it felt like a good balance.","The photo seems very accurate."
"everyday","I was worried about the style because Im apple shaped but it was perfect and actually slimming.","I work for plastic surgeons and it was totally appropriate for work.","Id rent it again."
"everyday","Loved this romper, such cute details with the cold shoulder and bubble sleeves - it was very flattering.","It does have a lot of buttons on the front, so it takes some time to get in and out of, but its worth it!","Unfortunately, mine was missing a button, so it gaped open - wish this would have been caught before it shipped to me."
"everyday","I love the print of this dress.","Although the waistline is at the smallest part of the waist, the dress tends to shift, and I didnt feel like it was as flattering as other Rebecca Taylor clothes that Ive worn.","However, overall, its a really nice day dress and is great for busty women as theres plenty of room in the chest area."
"everyday","I loved the girly, unique look of this dress!","It actually comes in two pieces - a slip with cami straps and the ruffly skirt, and the top that goes over it.","The slip was a little tight for my full bust, but you would never have known with the top over it.","I would recommend this style for smaller busted women because the flowy style of the top wasnt the most flattering look for larger chests.","However, it was very comfortable and so fun!"
"everyday","Great jacket!","Arms a little snug so best when worn with sleeveless tops."
"everyday","It fits way better than the model photo and is forgiving for larger breasts.","A gorgeous summer dress."
"everyday","I wore this for the 4th of July and it was great for the casual BBQ we went to.","Overall the dress was fun and easy to wear, consisted of nice thick fabric that didnt cling to much and was on trend with the lace up details on the front.","There wasnt anything super special about it- kinda plain but it was still a dress I would recommend for anyone looking for something for a casual event or everyday wear."
"everyday","Love the cream collar and its incredibly soft."
"everyday","The arms fit tight and are hard to adjust.","My arms are pretty toned and I had a hard time getting this sweater adjusted on my arms and it felt tight, but it was cute and I like the material.","It was a little short on my taller frame.","Good for a very petite frame."
"everyday","The dress runs slightly large but I was easily able to create a shape by adding a belt.","Easy to style for different occasions from pool day to office."
"everyday","Perfect over sized sweater.","Really warm and the quality of the fabric is great...thick, but not too bulky.","Great for winter!"
"everyday","Soft, nice sweater with some fun detail."
"everyday","This dress was sized perfectly.","I rented it under my unlimited subscription as an everyday, easy summer dress.","It just so happened it worked perfectly to wear out on the boat on the 4th of July with an American flag scarf (and messy post-scuba diving hair).","The only downfall to this go-to sheath is that the jean material wrinkles very easily during travel."
"everyday","  Runs small.","Sleeves were short.","Also the fringe looked a bit worn..."
"everyday","I got a ton of compliments.","Id definitely rent it again."
"everyday","I really love this dress, perfect if youre having a bad body day.","It was really comfortable and the fabric is really nice.","It definitely runs big and is obviously suppose to be a sheath but I will reserve a Small next time."
"everyday","I am obsessed with this wrap dress.","It is the perfect length and gives a nice hour glass shape as it cinches in at the waist.","To add color to this dress I recommend a fun statement necklace, earrings, or heel."
"everyday","Looks super cute on line, is very misleading.","Very long, arm holes are large.","Material is very rough and uncomfortable.","Hits very long.","Very disappointed."
"everyday","Loved the colors and the comfort of this dress.","Wish it werent so long, but worked fine with tall wedges.","The top has some elasticity which makes it great for all bust sizes.","Will rent again!"
"everyday","It was fun for a day at the local winery.","Runs pretty large but the neckline and draping are flattering."
"everyday","Great fitting, soft fabric."
"everyday","This delicate summer piece is beautiful.","Felt pretty wearing it!","The fabric is light and airy.","I am 52 and the length was fine for me, though it grazed the floor just a bit with my flat sandals.","However, there is an elastic waist I was able to pull up a little to bring the hemline up a tad so it was not a problem.","I also had the option of wearing 2 inch heels that would have solved it, but I opted to go with the flats.","the adjustable straps are very helpful, too.","Love the ruffle in the chest - Great for small cups like me - size B!","I paired with a denim jacket, which came off later.","Will most likely rent again!"
"everyday","I like the look of these pants, however I have larger legs so they werent the most flattering pants for my thighs.","But the main issue with these pants is the thickness, they feel like winter pants.","I live in Texas, so on a warm day they would be way too hot."
"everyday","I loved the colors in this top and the boho style with the full sleeves from the elbow is right on trend.","My one negative comment is that it ran large in the shoulders and I felt like it was slipping around a bit.","I do have small shoulders so maybe its me.","It made a cute weekend outfit with light wash jeans, espadrilles and an orange  bag that matched the embroidery."
"everyday","Wore this dress for my birthday, and I got it free with my RTR membership.","Youll need to wear a strapless bra.","Also, I have a large bust and noticed the space between the 1st and 2nd buttons didnt lay flat, especially when I was sitting.","It created a large gap, too.","I wish I had a pin for it.","Going a size up might have helped, but then I think I would have been swimming in the dress.","Overall I loved the color and the shape of the dress."
"everyday","I love this dress!","The length is a bit long for my petite frame, but it works with the cut out shoulders.","Its a perfect date night dress or throw on a blazer for work!"
"everyday","I absolutely loved this romper.","Its fabric is extremely light weight but not see through and perfect  for both day and night!"
"everyday","I dont typically do silk tops (sweat), so this was great as a rental.","Nice, slimming fit and I liked the button sleeves.","Could wear with jeans, shorts, or nicer pants.","Im between a 4 and 6 (and a S and M), and the small fit perfectly"
"everyday","I got compliments on the pattern of this romper, but I wouldnt say it was the most flattering thing Ive worn.","Paired it with a belt to help.","Its on the short side (and thats with me having a short torso), and the liner at the bottom was tighter on my hips.","Worth trying though!"
"everyday","This blouse was lovely.","It fit perfectly and the fabric was heavenly.","The straps were perfect and allowed me to wear a normal bra without any problems.","I received many compliments and would rent again in a heartbeat."
"everyday","I loved the body of the dress, it was super fun and flattering, and while I thought I would like the flare at the bottom of the sleeve, I found it to be too much and ended up rolling them up.","Overall however I would say it was a super cute dress!"
"everyday","The size 12 was a little big on me, but they were out of the size 10.","Still, really comfortable to wear and the dress is more lightweight than it appears."
"everyday","Fit: Runs large and long - I am 51 and the bottom of the coat hit me mid/low calf.","It is designed to be baggy, which is a style I like to wear despite my height and smaller frame.","Fellow shorties who dont gravitate towards the oversized will probably feel over-powered and not like wearing this.","Material: This material feels soft like a nice lived-in, wool blanket.","Any breeze blows it open since there are no buttons but because it kept warm otherwise I didnt mind holding it closed when it was windy (I rented this at the end of February in New York City).","Style: Without really planning, I ended up with a 90s look - I wore the coat with jeans, Doc Martens, a baggy black tshirt and a gray beanie hat."
"everyday","The pattern of this jumpsuit and the fabric looks and feels amazing.","The length was great as well.","The only thing about it is that the fabric can cause it to be clingy/static-y.","So be aware of that."
"everyday","I should have ordered the small, but the xs worked.","The fabric is thick and soft."
"everyday","Great color!","One of those shirts that makes you feel happy when you put it on.","The sleeves and the shoulders are roomy but its a little snug around the chest.","I would recommend sizing up if you have a larger chest.","I wore it with skinny jeans and chunky heals for work and get quite a few compliments!"
"everyday","This dress is SO long.","Will not work for anyone who is short.","My tallest wedge didnt help at all.","At 50 the regular length was a foot+ too long."
"everyday","This dress showed up brand new with tags still attached.","The color is really pretty.","It did run a little tight in the chest area (I have a larger chest), but not so tight that I couldnt wear it.","The dress is casually chic and was  really cute paired with lacy taupe wedges.","Great both for work and for a casual Easter Sunday.","I would definitely rent again."
"everyday","I want to keep it!","I rented this from Unlimited, and wore it to work and then to an event in the evening.","I received so many compliments, and it made my waist look so itty bitty!","The weight of this dress is really nice; it was great for a rainy cool Spring day.","I have a full bustline (32F), and I did find the dress top a bit loose, I found myself readjusting it a few times throughout the day.","I would probably size down next time, but wow, this dress is a head turner, and is so incredibly flattering!","Hello, hourglass!"
"everyday","im petite and wear a 0 or 00 in everything, but I could barely get this over my arms.","I would recommend sizing up 2 whole sizes if you get this jacket.","It was gorgeous though!","I was disappointed to not get to wear it."
"everyday","Fit was perfect, the sides are cut in in a very tailored way.","The jacket is perfect for the mixed up hot/cold weather in San Francisco in summer!"
"everyday","Loved this piece - have rented it TWICE.","The fit is relaxed chic and the v-neck isnt too low to wear at the office."
"everyday","It fits true to size.","The only con is that is a bit tough to take on/off"
"everyday","I ordered both the sr and the mr and still unsure which looked better.","The SR was sorter and the arm holes are smaller but the large and the extra fabric made it flow and feel more luxurious.","The picture is me in the MR.","Im 55 and the cuts up the side were wonderful way to wear a long dress, but not look drowning.","I think it would work for any height.","Also this flows nice in the wind.","Definitely wear it on a boat the length will keep it from flying up.","Very comfortable and beautiful fabric."
"everyday","the color was more of a magenta, opposed to the hot pink or fuchsia.","cute style"
"everyday","vibrant color but poor fit for me"
"everyday","I love this dress, but I could not fit into the xsmall.","Not even close.","If I was going to try again I would get a medium, thats how far off it was.","This is great for truly very petite women.","It really was a beautiful silk and great silhouette!"
"everyday","The top part runs very large"
"everyday","I wore it to work so the 6 was comfortable.","Would have worn 4 if evening event.","It hits mid-thigh and Im 55.","I guess it looks just like photo."
"everyday","Got tons of compliments.","Comfortable and flattering."
"everyday","This dress delivers in the areas of cut and color.","The purple is deep and bold and the fabric is thick and sturdy, which creates a nice shape.","Its a tad shorter than I would like but not inappropriate.","I just had to be extra cognizant of walking/bending, etc.","One word of caution: if you are sensitive about your arms or shoulders this may not be the dress for you.","The cap sleeves define that area, drawing extra attention to it and restricting arm movement just a bit."
"everyday","I am 57 and the dress with a 4 Wedge allows the shoe to be shown off...","I have a very large bust and my girls were out there!","Very comfy, light, perfect for wedding, date....anything..."
"everyday","sleeves are really unique - would not wear under jacket"
"everyday","Beautiful fit for a long and lean body.","Its typical European designer sizing, so err on the side of a larger size.","I did that, and it fit perfectly!","The layered sides with the single strip of a dark color in the middle make you look very slim.","Fabric is very nice, and the details were perfect.","The dress has a lot of character and doesnt need accessories...just a nice pair of shoes (I chose my silver Diors) and go!"
"everyday","This coat is so beautiful.","It is very heavy: I think the coat weighs about 15 pounds.","The neck is huge.","You can either wear it down over your shoulders like the model does in the picture, or you can wear it up around your neck almost like a big, built in scarf.","Either way, its absolutely gorgeous.","I felt like a million dollars in it.","Random strangers were stopping me on the street to compliment it.","Rent it!"
"everyday","I understand now why reviewers were saying this sweater is really thick.","No matter your expectations, nothing prepares you for how thick this sweater is.","Definitely size up!","I had a hard time getting in and out of the sweater because its so tight.","On the plus side, this sweater is SO warm that if its a little cool outside, you can do with a light jacket on top or not at all.","On the other hand, I was unable to wear a specific coat with this sweater, because the sweater was so thick that I couldnt get the coat on over it.","Fun sweater though, and would consider renting again in the cool fall weather."
"everyday","Love this shirt.","Hubby said it was sexy, but I felt classy while wearing it.","A tad bit tight in the chest,  for this curvy girl, but I though it looked great.","Would definitely rent again!"
"everyday","I wanted to love this/like this so bad.","However, it wrinkled so easily that it seemed un-wearable.","Bottom line for me the quality was lacking big time.","My biggest beef with clothes these days.","The other thing that potential renters should be aware of is height.","Im 53 and I think this would look better on the taller gals.","For me this was a miss."
"everyday","comfortable fit throughout, soft leather, flattering fit."
"everyday","I wore this on a casual Friday at work with black jeans and leather black flats and have literally never received so many compliments at work before!","Everybody, myself included, loved this sweater.","The black is perfect for keeping it minimal with a totally wild and fun sleeve.","Loved it, definitely would recommend renting it!"
"everyday"," Great black top"
"everyday","Loved this style!","This style runs on the big side and can be worn with a standard bra.","I am normally a large but could have easily worn the M in this style.","The fabric offers no stretch however the elastic waist band cinches you in at the smallest part of the waist.","Due to the top of the dress running big the straps tend to fall down a bit.","The fabric is thin and breathable great for the hot summer weather.","Great for everyday or a summer day in the city."
"everyday","The fit is a little strange.","I am more curvy so it definitely does not highlight an hourglass figure.","For everyday wear Id try it again but definitely not for an event"
"everyday","This top was gorgeous.","I received multiple compliments.","I wore it to an NFL tailgate and game.","It was comfortable and flattering although I recommend wearing a tank underneath it.","I wore it with dark denim leggings and riding boots.","Wish I owned it."
"everyday","true to form"
"everyday","the arms are very small.","was not comfortable at all"
"everyday","This was a super sleek style that was perfect for work into night drinks.","I will say that the waist was very fitted with little stretch.","Otherwise, the style was comfortable in the bust in hips.","There is the overlapping fabric detail that does gape open more than I had originally expected, so I recommend with a slip or wearing on a non windy day!","I love that you can wear this more casually or dress up with accessories for a more formal event.","Love!"
"everyday","Accommodated my bust size, and it wasnt too short.","Not anything special though, wouldnt rent it again."
"everyday","Im normally a 6 and opted for the XS because I really wanted to try this dress but my size was never available.","The XS actually ended up working great and was only a little tight in the boobs (36C).","I think a small would have been better fitting in the bust but then would be too billowy in the bottom.","It is so well made and the embroidery is just amazing!","It was the perfect thickness of cotton so it wasnt too hot or too cold.","I plan to buy it for next summer!"
"everyday","Felt like a little kid in this kid."
"everyday","Great blouse.","Loads of compliments.","Very comfortable and flattering.","Great with white jeans."
"everyday","I really liked the look of this coat, but I guess I should have sized up?","The 6 wasnt available when I rented so I got the 4, which is my regular size but I like coats to be a little roomier.","It fit okay for the most part but the sleeves were definitely a little too short and it was a little tight in the shoulders.","I wore it once anyways before returning.","It is a cute coat, definitely kept wishing it had pockets (I couldnt tell if it actually did but they were still sealed if so and I didnt want to open them just in case).","All in all, a really cute everyday coat if you are just a little shorter"
"everyday","didnt wear - it shed too much on my pants"
"everyday","I was 33 weeks pregnant when I wore this dress in a size larger (Medium) than my usual size.","It was loose and comfortable.","Not the most stylish or form-fitting dress but easy and comfortable for work.","I dont know if I would wear this is I wasnt pregnant as its not the most flattering fit."
"everyday","This was a super cute slouchy sweater but didnt look too baggy or unflattering.","The neckline is really cute and you can adjust the way that you wear it to show more or less shoulder so it was appropriate for work but also was cute to wear out after work.","I wore this with black jeans and black booties and it was so cute.","Will admit I also wore it with leggings hanging around the house and it was super comfortable"
"everyday","Seems cheap"
"everyday","this top runs big!"
"everyday","The XS fit me perfectly and Im usually a 4; on the curvy side.","Great for me, not for someone thinner.","At 52 the length was long but I anticipated this (everything is long for me).","I felt well dressed for Thanksgiving with my husbands family and super comfortable.","I received lots of compliments on the color and would love to keep this one!","The one bummer is that my fashion tape didnt want to adhere to the fabric blend.","It worked for a bit but not for the whole night."
"everyday","Fits true to size.","Is rather warm.","Youll want to save this for a cold day.","I liked the silver zippers and style, but nothing made this stand out.","Didnt receive any compliments in this one.","Its cute and Im glad I could wear it, but I wont rent it again."
"everyday","I really liked this dress.","I had previously rented the black one in small and it was a bit too big, the xs fit much better although it is still loose around the waist which is cute and forgiving.","If you dont like that looseness, its easy to fix with a belt without it looking bunchy.","I was also afraid the white might be see-through but it wasnt at all!","Definitely recommend :)"
"everyday","RTR will never see this shirt again.","I LOVE this shirt!","It looks great with black pants, holey jeans and heels, pencil skirts, etc.","It is a little baggy in the bust and therefore it fits me perfectly.","Its basically mine now."
"everyday","This is kind of is a statement piece, I loved it so much that I wore it a bunch to work (and work = engineering startup where people dont dress up) but it got lots of love, especially from the ladies which is great.","I might need to rent it again."
"everyday","Cute, adorable flowers and an overall nice shape yet the skirt is a bit thick with fabric.","If you are fuller in figure, you may not appreciate the fuller fabric."
"everyday","Loved the fit on this but it ran rather baggy for a size 2."
"everyday","This dress is amazing, but it would have been better if I were two inches taller.","Id say at 53 Im petite, but I really couldnt carry this dress.","I got the XS and it was just a lot of fabric for me to carry even with wedges."
"everyday","Im typically a size 4 on the top and the small was perfect on me.","It also was great on the length.","If I had gone smaller in the XS, (which I think I could have because the arm holes are roomy), I think the seaming in the front wouldnt have fallen so beautifully because it would have been a tad too snug.","Im glad I went with the small.","So many compliments!","Bright and a great pop of subtle color - so vibrant!","The cut is really sexy for sculpting the neck and arms which is a bonus!"
"everyday","I loved the dress and had a ball wearing it.","However, the cleavage was all over the place in this dress, LOL.","Id do it all over again in a heartbeat."
"everyday","Every time I walked outside I had to hold the skirt with both hands--one to keep the front shut, the other to keep the back down.","Could not wait to take it off."
"everyday","This dress runs HUGE!","Order at least one size down.","It looked like it would have been nice in the right size, but it was way too big to wear."
"everyday","Can be dressed up or down, and is perfect for everyday both in and out of the office!"
"everyday","DEFINITELY order up!","I usually wear an 8 but got the 12 instead.","Still form fitting and a little too short for work so I wore with black tights and heels."
"everyday","Made for a fun and modern work look!"
"everyday","I wore this top on a night out with friends.","The color is not as pastel pink as in the picture.","It is very flowy and comfortable."
"everyday","I ended up not wearing this shirt.","Maybe if I had a bigger size.","I am a 34C and the shirt was kind of pulling around the chest.","The pictures dont really show how many buttons are truly on this shirt.","It was kind of a hassle to figure it out and in the end wasnt worth it."
"everyday","was a little too snug in the breast area"
"everyday","The belt was kind of loud, at least loud enough to be distracting.","Clink!","Clink!","Clink!"
"everyday","Its big and flowing with no real shape, but thats not a bad thing either.","Comfortable and a great pattern."
"everyday","Great dress wore it for work meetings with gold jewelry, easy to dress up or keep simple as it is."
"everyday","Comfy top, not too sheer over the boobs but definitely shows the mid-section.","I received a lot of compliments on this top!"
"everyday","Wore a large; the material is a bit heavy for summer heat but it is a nice jacket and fits well"
"everyday","My usual size is small, but I rented medium because I wanted to be comfortable in the chest area.","Small would fit me fine too.","The fabric is stretchy and soft."
"everyday","Wore this piece to work and then out for a client dinner and received SO MANY compliments.","IT was so comfortable, though the other reviews that the torso is short is true, not in anyway to the extent unwearable.","I wore with flats for work and heels for dinner and both ways felt just as beautiful.","not really my normal go to style, but so glad i tried it"
"everyday","Cute top, a little short and boxy.","Nice change for a casual top .","I wear a small in tops and rented a 36.","Fit true to size, I just wore a cami underneath to hide my stomach from peeking out."
"everyday","I ended up wearing this to walk around NYC for the day.","Loved the back.","Great length on me.","Im normally a large but the reviews said it ran big and it definitely does....I wore the medium."
"everyday","This is such a cute dress for spring/summer.","I am petite and the cut and length were perfect for me.","On anyone taller, I think it would be way too short.","I loved the deep V neck ... added just enough sexiness.","I dropped a star because the dress arrived with the V-neck frayed (or maybe even ripped, I couldnt tell).","It wasnt entirely obvious, but noticeable."
"everyday","The fabric is stretchy, heavy, and very thick.","It drapes beautifully.","Great color."
"everyday","I really liked the fit and the feel of the fabric."
"everyday","Loved the sweatshirt and the pants!","The top was cute but too open in the back for me, wore it anyway and it was a great outfit.","I wore the sweatshirt on its own with jeans and adidas and it was very cute and comfy.","Would buy this outfit!"
"everyday","It is a great dress but this one looked a little over loved/worn."
"everyday","I didnt end up wearing it, as I didnt love how the sleeves were almost detached from the dress, but if you like that trend, youll love this dress!"
"everyday","This dress is adorable!","Its fits your body just right and the little gap in the front makes it fun and different!"
"everyday","I liked the look and fit of this top on me.","I wore it for Thanksgiving dinner with fitted black pants and liked how they complemented each other.","I will rent again!"
"everyday","The dress was perfect.","Great with a jean jacket and keds sneakers.","It was a good length which I was concerned about given the pictures, but it worked out perfectly!"
"everyday","This dress fit really well and I got so many complements on it!","It was super cute, and so light a airy for the hot New York summer!"
"everyday","Gorgeous leather, versatile, and very comfortable.","Looks lovely open or zipped up.","Feminine and not too biker looking.","Since the sleeves are short and it hits at the waist, this is a perfect jacket for petites.","Its runs slightly on the small side, so if you are between sizes, size up."
"everyday","I wish I had taken a photo of this top because it was very cute and my boyfriend loved it on me.","It was a nice sturdy material with a perfect cut - fit right at the bust and flared out slightly for a flowy fit.","The white strip across the chest made for some nice cleavage.","It was a perfect summer top with white jeans and I wish I could have kept it!"
"everyday","Runs true to size"
"everyday","Loved this jacket!","I found myself wearing it all the time - perfect for that still winter, but should be spring weather.","Highly recommend!"
"everyday","Love the dress a lot, and it looks better in person.","However, the material caught winkles very easily after a short morning, and that was a little upsetting."
"everyday","Great print with colors that match everything.","With room in the arms, waist, and bust and no stretch to the fabric Id recommend ordering your true size.","Definitely on the longer side, this top looks great with pants or leggings for a more casual look.","Comfy and breezy, would love to own!"
"everyday","Absolutely LOVED the way this dress fell.","I looked feminine, curvy, and thin and it accentuated all of the right parts.","I expected the fabric to feel sort of rustic (cotton or linen maybe) but it was silky and beautiful.","I wore this for a cookout we were hosting at our house and got several compliments (but more like Wow, you look fabulous!","rather than Wow what a dress!)","It was so complimentary to my body- which is kind of rare after just having a baby.","I could wear this for anything from going to the zoo with the kids to on a date with my husband.","Super comfortable and just gorgeous."
"everyday","The belt is attached through the waist of the dress, so I couldnt adjust it to my natural waist without some gaping of the extra fabric at the top.","Regardless, the fabric was light and breezy, pattern and cut were flattering, and this was a great dress for everyday wear."
"everyday","Wore this on a trip to NYC in october.","It fit great, but if i was planning to wear it with a sweater, i would order a size up.","Very cute.","Got a ton of compliments in NYC."

"everyday","I love this top and considered purchasing.","The style is cute while at the same time comfortable and easy to wear."
"everyday","I wore this to work twice and got so many compliments.","The bomber styling is so on trend, and the color is beautiful."

"everyday","Absolutely in love with this dress!","The style, the colors, the patterns, and the fit are all amazing.","The dress runs true to size and is very comfy.","The fabric has no stretch.","A standard bra can be worn with this dress, but I did not wear one with it.","The material is light, so you will be nice an cool in the summer.","definitely renting again!"
"everyday","This top is really cool.","The gingham makes it stand out from all the other cold shoulder tops.","I had to belt it because it was so big but I loved it."
"everyday","sleek & simple with an updated 70s feel.","Great for everyday."
"everyday","Knit seems to have washed up by a size.","I took an 8 - but really the fit was too neat and the sleeves too short.","If I order again I will go for size 10."
"everyday","The fit was just awkward for me.","I felt like the waist fit at a weird spot on my hips that made me look wider.","If I pulled it up more to my natural waist, it was too short on bottom and too much fabric on top.","I didnt end up wearing, sent it back right away.","Might work better on someone less curvy."
"everyday","The lower, white portion of this shirt is stiff."
"everyday","This is a light, classy summer dress.","I really liked the material and pattern.","I have a larger chest and had some issues with gapping at the top of the dress.","Since its a button up, its not that forgiving.","I have pretty large hips, so the dress was a bit tight there as well.","I would recommend it for a less curvy woman."
"everyday","Ive worn this dress every chance I can and gotten over the top compliments.","So cute and unique."
"everyday","comfy for car ride but a bit too short for me to feel comfortable"
"everyday","I was amazed how nice this faux fur felt.","the top part is longer hair and really soft and fluid am considering hanging onto this for a while."
"everyday","This was my back up dress because my first dress was delayed in shipping by UPS to Michigan and I was flying out from Michigan to Florida.","So I had them mail me this dress to Florida but they didnt!","They mailed it by accident to Michigan so when I got to Florida I had no dress for my event.","This is the second time this has happened.","It puts you in a horrible situation when you are out of town, have a tight schedule and have no dress for the event.","I tried on the dress when I got back to Michigan and it fit.","It had a little extra room but I loved it.","Wish I would have had it for the event and in Florida."
"everyday","Wore for Saturday brunch and it was perfect."
"everyday","im not a girly girl and have been told ruffles looks terrible on me.","that being said, this dress is so awesome.","its fun and flirty, but the color and pattern keep it from being annoyingly girly.","its so light and comfortable and light, too.","perfect for spring or fall.","i wore it with tan suede booties and a wide dark brown belt, reg bra.","hem hit a touch above the knee.","im typically btwn a 2 and a 4, 4 fit me great, comfy with plenty of room for dinner."
"everyday","I am a tall size 8-10 with a large bust so I was afraid this wouldnt fit me - but it did and fits like a dream, and is SO cool!","I have never received more compliments.","Goes with everything.","Would agree thoguh - the belt is super loud so I took off and never wore...","LOVED IT!"
"everyday","Such a fun dress!","This style looks good on everyone, including baby bumps.","The pockets add some casual fun, and the floral print makes this a great spring transition piece.","The skirt fell a bit above my knee, and Im about 56.","The fabric has no stretch, so size up for your backup.","This style is also standard bra friendly.","Pair this look with some scrappy gladiators and chunky baubles."
"everyday","The only con is the scarf part doesnt want to stay folded/slung over your shoulder."
"everyday","Nice comfy top, very light material but not too shear.","Runs a little big"
"everyday","Unable to put dress on due to it being too small to fit across my shoulders or hips.","It was also very short.","Had to return."
"everyday","I love this top because my husband loved this top.","he couldnt stop telling me how great it looked.","was a little on the small side but its fitted so its supposed to be that way"
"everyday","I didnt end up wearing this dress because it was empire waistline which I didnt gather from the pictures.","The s might have been a little better but its also cotton or flannel, very casual.","Not a bad dress but just not what I was looking for."
"everyday","The overall color is darker than the photo shown."
"everyday","i really love this top!","im normally a size medium (solid 36C) but i definitely couldve worn a size small.","I styled it with a black crop jacket for work so i could wear it for my night out after work.","I also felt I needed wear that because I didnt wear a bra, it just showed on the side so when i went braless there  was some side boob action which i think would be eliminated with a smaller size but was easily hidden with my cropped jacket.","its a little tricky in the back- its not the most flattering on flabby-ish arms (from the back) but its still a great top and really, how many people are looking at you from the back?","i live in LA so a bit more vain/insecure about those things.","i like the front because the sleeves arent cap sleeves, they are more raglan sleeves so they hide the chicken fat.","its also comfortably fitted because its a long zipper down the back so it creates a nice silhouette and taper.","Im considering purchasing this top because its functional comfortable and fun.","i love its flexibility with events you can wear it to.","i also feel like, yes its peplum but not overly peplum so i feel like i wont be sick of it next season"
"everyday","The wrapping was a little tricky and would come loose throughout the day so I had to retie in the bathroom at work a time or two but the top is beautiful."
"everyday","The pattern and material are really nice.","The fit is a tad strange.","I am thin with a slightly above average bust, the dress was tight around my ribcage, but loose around the breast area.","It kind of looks like I am wearing an old school bullet bra.","It seems like you need a very specific body type for this dress."
"everyday","This top was perfect for a concert with the girls.","I love off the shoulder styles so I knew Id like this top.","The elastic does pinch a little more than other off the shoulder tops, however.","It was fine for a few hours but by the end of the night I was ready to take it off.","Also, the lattice detail runs right down each breast so you definitely need a bandeau under this to avoid showing too much!"
"everyday","Classic cut that is not too revealing.","However, this dress runs large.","I would reorder again as park of unlimited membership, but would size down to account for stretch and skirt length."
"everyday","The small fit me perfectly, and the fabric is thick enough that it doesnt call attention to any tummy bulges.","I paired it with a denim jacket and fringed sneakers for a day at the park."
"everyday","Im not even a vest person, but this one rocks.","The color and shape is perfect.","Fits snug (as a vest should) and the color is so stylish.","Lays very smooth, no bumps or bulkiness.","I rarely wear vests but this one I had to keep!","price was pretty good.","Its very warm so this can definitely be a winter item."
"everyday","I loved the interesting cut of the shirt.","It fit well and was good quality.","The pattern looked a little old, though, and was just too much with asymmetric style.","Would have loved in a solid color."
"everyday","a little tight across the back"
"everyday","This dress is a showstopper when seen in person.","It felt wonderful, and apparently looked it as well.","I received more compliments on this dress that I usually do in a month, and I wear dresses on a daily basis."
"everyday","The fit for this is a little big but it is meant to be oversized, it is thick, warm, and cozy.","If it wasnt so expensive I wouldve purchased it to keep!"
"everyday","This shirt was true to size in my opinion because I believe it is cut to have a looser overall fit."
"everyday","fit beautifully."
"everyday","It was a little tight around the arms, but nothing uncomfortable.","The fabric was thick enough that it didnt wrinkle and you didnt absolutely need to wear a bra.","Otherwise, strapless is necessary because the straps poke out in the back.","Cute dress for everyday in the summer."
"everyday","I liked the dress but didnt love it.","Its nice for everyday but definitely not a showstopper.","The material seemed a little cheap / polyesterish to me.","Color is more of a burnt orange than a bright orange."
"everyday","This felt short in the torso, but the pattern is so pretty.","I really wanted to love it, but couldnt.","I did wear it and the lining felt uncomfortable and shifted all around.","There are so many good rompers on RTR, so I would stick with those."
"everyday","This dress was perfect for everyday and would be great for business casual.","I love the A Line look, so this dress was great.","It was a little snug on top, and wasnt form fitting throughout the rest of the dress, but overall a classic dress!"
"everyday","Lightweight for spring or fall.","Color is much closer to an olive green than the brown shown in the photo."
"everyday","got this with my unlimited subscription.","It was cute but nothing spectacular.","I wore it to work over a black skirt and black turtleneck and then to girls night with black jeans and a white camisole.","Worth a rent."
"everyday","I loved this romper.","Its a keeper!","The material was breezy for summer and it had a really cute shape.","Would definitely rent (or buy!)","again."
"everyday","No cons to this dress.","Lovely for summer"
"everyday","Really comfy and unique casual button down.","It was very flattering - not too tight but not too oversized either.","I sized up one size as Id rather it be on the looser side."
"everyday","Wore to a friends birthday party with dark jeans and snakeskin flats.","My shipment was missing the pussy bow and I ended up wearing it backwards, but it was still a good going-out piece!","Would be a great standard to have in my closet."
"everyday","Be prepared – someones going to comment on how cool this sweater is every time you walk into a shop!","It really is super cool, despite its somewhat baggy shape.","I wore it with navy cropped wide-leg trousers and heels, and with light wash jeans as shown by the model.","Note that the giant weaves you see in the sweater are holes, open to the outside – youll have to wear something underneath this if its cold.","And dont fear the bagginess – thats part of the sweater.","Also note that on me (VERY tall) the sweater was much more cropped than on the model."
"everyday","I receive compliments on this dress everywhere, streetcorners, elevators,  train stops.","I have an hourglass body, the 10 was comfy with being too baggy but I think I could have sized down to an 8."
"everyday","Such a fun pattern and comfy fit for casual summer days.","The defined waist also gives an hour glass shape.","One thing I will recommend is if you are larger chested definitely go up a size or 2.","I am a size 32a and the 0 was very snug on me without a bra."
"everyday","I absolutely loved wearing this skirt so much, Im thinking of purchasing it.","Its so feminine, and pretty!","The fit was good too, high waisted but I love that style!"
"everyday","I could have gone smaller in the waist but not in the boobs (Im 34 C/D, breast feeding boobs..ha!)","I wore it with tan burberry heels which was super cute.","I then changed in to tan sandals.","Its a cotton stretch dress.","I loved it."
"everyday","The arms fit a bit tight but otherwise this was a great shirt for a Friday at work when I had evening plans!"
"everyday","I wore this jacket to dress up jeans a little bit.","It was extremely comfortable, and I wished that I could have kept it!","It is very warm, so it was perfect for walking around and visiting a museum on Black Friday.","If you are on the fence about what size to get, size down.","I can fit a S or XS, but the XS was perfect."
"everyday","I usually wear between a 4-6 so I ordered a medium in this after reading the previous reviews.","It was the right decision as it fits pretty tight but it did look very flattering and I really love the colors!","Will rent it again!"
"everyday","Super cute dress!","Great color."
"everyday","I would say this dress runs slightly larger than true size.","The dress was a beautiful orange-red color that is perfect for spring.","The waist is slightly fitted with an elastic rouching on the back and peplum at the waist, which gives the slip dress a very flattering and elongating shape.","Wore it all day and stayed relatively wrinkle free.","This is one Id love to keep!"
"everyday","This jacket was super cute.","It was pretty thin, so not for super cold days but great for a light fall day.","It looked expensive & I felt very fashionable in it.","It does not close, I think its meant to be worn open, that didnt bother me at all though.","Definitely a like!"
"everyday","This top was felt like quality fabric.","When the button is unbuttoned at the neck, it falls very nicely.","The strings hang prettily and while the chest is exposed a little, the girls dont show :)"
"everyday","The size was right and the color was lovely."
"everyday","An elegant and casual top!","Love this for a date or weekend trip.","This runs true to size and is great for any cup size.","There is not stretch in the fabric, so if you are worried about fit we recommend sizing up.","This may be worn with a standard bra!","Pair this with a simple bag and simple earrings!"
"everyday","This romper was SO FREAKING CUTE.","I loved the way it looked and felt.","I wore it to a work meeting with other teachers and they loved it.","It was nice because it wasnt too short, so it was work appropriate.","but not so long that it was like... granny-esque.","Now, the downside- it went on easily.","It buttoned up and fit perfectly.","And it was super comfy to wear- but I COULD NOT GET IT OFF.","It was inflexible and tight, so my husband helped me out of it and I didnt put it back on.","But it was so cute, Im tempted to rent it again."
"everyday","Great fit but is a bit long!","Im 53 and it was way below my knees."
"everyday","This was a cute day dress that I wore with a belt to cinch my waist in.","Cute and classic."
"everyday","Worked best with high waisted jeans, and I tucked the inner straps into my bra straps.. did not feel they were necessary.","Would rent again!"
"everyday","The chest / top part is incredibly flattering.","Loved the fluttery cut at the bottom.","Beautiful movement when walking."
"everyday","I love this shirt!","Unfortunately its dry clean only, so as an every day shirt its a bit of an investment, but my boyfriend loved it so much he talked me into buying it anyway."
"everyday","This jacket fit nicely and I wore it with a range of things from a tank top to a long dress.","Gave it a bit of edge.","The only issue is the material at the back of the neck kept rubbing up against my neck making it a bit raw and had to keep taking it off."
"everyday","I rented this to wear to work and on the weekends.","I got lots of compliments at work (havent worn it on a weekend yet).","Its so comfortable and very flattering.","Long enough to wear heels but short enough to wear flats without looking frumpy."
"everyday","This romper was a bit too short for this tall girl to wear!","Too bad, because I absolutely loved the light fabric and design of it."
"everyday","Fits great.","Not too tight in the bust and not too short, both common problems for me."
"everyday","This dress fit very oddly; the top was very baggy on me.","The slit, which looks like its small, is actually quite large and exposed too much skin for my taste.","As a shorter person, the length was too long.","Overall just not a good style for me!","I think if you are tall and thin with a larger bust, this would look great on you."
"everyday","I wanted to love this one, but it fell a bit short of expectations.","Theres nothing wrong with it, but theres no wow to this.","Its just a nice, fairly ordinary top."
"everyday","This shirt was very cute on - wore it for work and going out afterwards.","The only issue I had is with the cutout in the front - it doesnt go straight down the middle, but rather at an angle, and was deeper than the picture shows, so finding a bra that wouldnt show was tricky."
"everyday","The fit was good.","It was nice and loose as a small.","I could have probably gotten an XS and still had it loose, but the small was fine.","The pattern was really cute with the teal brush stroke-looking print.","I really liked that the sleeves were not cap sleeves.","They went to about midway between my shoulder and elbow and I liked that it covered up that part of my arm.","The length of the shirt was also ideal.","I could raise my hands and it didnt show my stomach."
"everyday","Felt true to size.","Cute dress with a lightweight material.","Would rent again for the right event as it can be dressed up or down"
"everyday","Love this dress.","It is a very comfortable material and loose fitting.","I also love that it is short even on my 54 frame.","I got so many compliments all day and even ending up buying the dress I loved it so much."
"everyday","I ordered the S, as the XS was not available.","I typically wear an XS/2.","There is no way the XS would have fit me.","It pulled across my waist, and I dont usually have such a problem.","I am not sure what body type I would recommend this dress for, based on my experience.","I never got to wear it as it didnt fit."
"everyday","Stylish enough for a casual evening out"
"everyday","I wore this to the womens march on washington and felt strong and warm all day.","Its a great rental."
"everyday","This was a cute shirt, and I wore it with black skinny jeans.","Its a little tight in the chest area, but it wasnt actually as noticeable because the fabric is a bit thicker.","It does flare out at the bottom in front a little, so can give the pregnant look, but that could have just been how it fit me.","Nonetheless, it was still really cute & I wore it a few times."
"everyday","Love love love this jacket!","Super comfortable while still holding form to accentuate figure.","The hook eye buttons make it nice and streamline when worn, and adds class to any outfit!","Saving this for NYFW coming up soon!"
"everyday","This dress was adorable, but a little bit too big at the waist.","I wore it around NYC throughout the day, and it transitioned fairly well from a summery day-time dress to a casual summery night-time dress.","I threw a jacket over it in the evening to conceal how baggy it was at my waist (looked awkward).","My biggest issue with this dress was how easily it wrinkled and how well it held wrinkles.","I spent an hour trying to get the wrinkles out, just to have it wrinkle the moment I sat down.","Super frustrating, but alas.","It was cute enough, and I made it work once I got over my Type-A fear of wrinkled fabric."
"everyday","This was comfortable, light-weight sweater.","I wore with fitted jeans and leg warmers for a casual get together and also wore to work with black plaid pants and gray scarf."
"everyday","When I opened the bag and saw the sweater in person, I thought--eek, Im not going to like this.","The pink is 80s neon.","The sequins are big.","But I tried it on anyway.","It looked great with  skinny jeans and heels.","It was soft and comfortable.","I liked the depth of the v-neck.","It def.","runs large.","Id consider ordering a size down."
"everyday","I wore this on two occasions, once to work and once to dinner.","It is a stretchy knit wool  but not itchy.","The cut outs/embroidery is subtle but gorgeous.","Sizing true, if not generous, due to the stretch."
"everyday","Thinking about buying this jacket - love it!","Its a greenish brown super soft leather.","Looks great zipped or unzipped.","Rented with my unlimited subscription - have kept it a month so far and have worn it several times.","Highly recommend."
"everyday","I really loved this top and will definitely get it again.","Great for everyday wear.","You can make it casual by day, or dress it up for a night out."
"everyday","I liked this dress.","Wore it with knee high suede boots to work and felt cute and comfy all day.","I think I would like it better without the denim collar, but on the whole, I was happy with it.","It definitely runs big ."
"everyday","The lace is great for both nighttime and work time.","Will rent this again!"
"everyday","Beautiful fabric, quality feel.","LOVE IT.","It was a tiny bit big because Im inbetween S and M but this draped really nicely so it wasnt a problem."
"everyday","I got a medium thinking as a jacket it would be okay running a little big (the small wasnt available).","But this runs VERY large.","I would size down two sizes to get a good fit if I rented again."
"everyday","If anything, these pants run on the larger size.","I probably would have been fine with a 4 but it would have been too tight for work.","Loved them and would definitely rent them again!"
"everyday","I unfortunately ended up not wearing this dress because it ran a bit small.","Normally I wear a size 0 (occasionally the 2) and the 0 wouldnt zip up all the way for me to wear.","Its really an adorable dress so Im sure if I had a size larger it would have been perfect!"
"everyday","Shirt is definitely a stand out piece!","I gave it 4 stars because it is difficult to put on and tie the straps.","If there was a zipper or the chest area were stretchy it would be better but there is no stretch to the material.","I only keep the shirt for a couple days but it was fun to wear!"
"everyday","This skirt runs large and is very poofy.","The material is thick (not too warm for summer though) and doesnt wrinkle.","Do not wear in wind...."
"everyday","Great fit.","Warm and stylish.","Love the pockets!"
"everyday","Lightweight, silky fabric, easy breezy feel.","A little shorter than expected, therefore only 4 points.","Easy to wear but needed to have strapless bra.","wore with flats."
"everyday","Its large and baggy with a ton of side boob!","Wore it with a black  bralette  and flops to the dog park.","Good on a hot day when youre looking for something comfy and casual.","Has pockets which I always love!"
"everyday","I am fairly certain this sweater is meant to be worn with the zipper in the back -- not the regular way as shown on the model.","When I first put this sweater on with the zipper in front, it just felt.... weird.","Also, the designer label was in the front (although the RTR label was in the back).","So that seemed a little odd too.","I switched it around  so the zipper was in the back and it felt much better.","Curious, I googled this sweater and found many people wearing it with zipper-in-back, so Im guessing that is more standard.","That all being said -- I am usually a size small, but I ordered a size medium expecting this to be a layerable cardigan.","With zipper-in-back, this just looked really boxy when its probably meant to be more fitted.","I bet this would look cute if worn as a more fitted top.","I might try ordering it in my standard size and see if that looks better (with zipper-in-back.",":-) )"
"everyday","Super cute, spring/summer pants.","Running true to size with no stretch to the fabric, Id recommend sizing up for backup.","They hit high-waist and the fabric is lined, which makes them sturdier than I would have imagined.","The hips have room, but the waist is meant to be fitted.","Looks great with a tucked in top.","Wear with heels or flats."
"everyday","I really enjoyed wearing this top for a weekend daytime party.","It is very flattering and versatile."
"everyday","I normally wear a small and this is definitely form fitting.","Size up if you dont want it to be tight."
"everyday","Such a fun dress.","Fit like a glove and perfect length for short girls like me!","Its more fitted in the middle than I expected, but not in a way that was uncomfortable either.","Theres also a hook in the front so you can control the cleavage."
"everyday","I wore this dress to a weeknight play in the city with my husband.","It was dressy enough for the theatre, but casual enough for a weeknight date.","It could easily be dressed up for a more formal occasion.","This dress runs true to size.","I was impressed that at 53 I was able to wear flat sandals and this dress was the prefect length.","The synched waist was incredibly flattering.","Loved this dress!"
"everyday","This top almost didnt make it back to RTR.","It is a fantastic twist on a classic.","I wore it three times before sending it back.","Derek Lam does it again."
"everyday","Really liked this unique sweater.","While it is more of an oversized look, the small fit me perfectly, was almost a tad cropped, and was fairly flattering.","I didnt find it too itchy, but wore a t-shirt as a base layer just in case.","I wore it to work, and am planning on making some other weekday plans to have an excuse to wear it again.","Definitely my favorite RTR sweater so far!"
"everyday","Loved this flowy number.","This style runs true to size and made me feel like Carrier Bradshaw for a moment.","This style is very flowy and moves as you walk which the creates a little extra drama to this style.","The fabric has little to no stretch and the waist ran a little big on me.","This is best pair with a fitted simple top for a more casual look or a blouse and heels for work.","At 53 this fell at mid calf creating a midi length on me.","Please rent!"
"everyday","Gorgeous kelly-green shift - perfect for day or night!","The picture doesnt due this one justice as there are fine details that really make this dress fit like a dream.","Hubby noticed right away and remarked on this nice dress.","I wore this at the tail-end of summer but think it could be paired with tights and worn later into the year as well."
"everyday","Love the soft buttery feel of the quilted leather.","The cut and quality are outstanding.","Every detail from the even stitches on the quilting to the perfect color, the great stretch hem and cuffs to the perfect pockets and substantial zipper shouts designer quality style.","Thank you RTR for making this item available."
"everyday","Rented this for an everyday outfit.","I got a large since that is what i usually wear in dresses or pants, however this runs a little large and i wouldve been better off with an 8. it w as still cute however and I received a lot of compliments.","it is itchy material so i wore a black long sleeve shirt underneath.","still itchy around the collar but not too bad that I couldnt wear it.","Overall recommend, can dress it up or wear with jeans and be fashionable either way."
"everyday","ran a little large so the lace front hit lower than I liked.","Can be worn with a lace slip underneath."
"everyday","I adore this top and might buy it!","The material is thick and very flattering.","I have worn it to multiple occasions including work and a fancy restaurant.","I have a long torso and peplums are hit or miss with where they fit on me but this fits great!"
"everyday","fits perfectly to your body and can dress it up or down.","Loved it so much wore it 3 times."
"everyday","The dress fit true to size; a little loose in the waist for me, but the XS might have been too tight in the chest.","The skirt flows beautifully and there are slits in both the dress and the lining, so the bare leg does not often show and you dont have to worry about it.","I pinned the neck as others mentioned, so that it would lie flat  which also looks better on an older person.","Length was perfect with 2 inch heels.","I wore it to a medical conference at the hospital and then to a fancy dinner with my husband later.","I will rent the dress again; I loved wearing it."
"everyday","The size ran large on me, but the jacket still looked very nice.","Very comfortable light fabric.","Looked great with jeans, a pair of black pants for work and a simple classic black dress.","Loved it!","Bought it at DVF website for $199."
"everyday","I think this dress is chic and adorable, but not.","on.","me.","IMO, the dress would look best on taller girls with more broad shoulders that can carry the neckline of this dress (kind of like the model).","I have small shoulders and a bum and this dress made my shoulders look smaller and my bum look larger.","Returned without wearing."
"everyday","This dress hugged my curves just right and looked great.","I love this dress and cant wait to rent it again.","My friend was so surprised to hear it was not mine as she stated it fits you perfectly.","Loved this dress."
"everyday","I usually wear a size 2, but DVF runs very small.","The size 4 fit, but felt too snug for me to be 100% comfortable.","I would rent this again, but probably in a size 6."
"everyday","Heads up, the shirt is a little thin so you may want to wear something underneath if youre not comfortable.","It fits really well and the tie looks great!"
"everyday","Although short in length, really cute, casual, but fun, top.","I wore to a casual holiday party with jeans and sneakers.","Really cute."
"everyday","The fabric is a very light polyester that feels like silk, fresh and supple.","Very flattering and spring-like.","I love the colors!","Fits well over jeans or a white pant.","The figure is quite fitting, enhancing the waist.","The cleavage tends to open so you will likely need to wear something under it, depending on your bust size"
"everyday","It was shorter than anticipated, but it worked."
"everyday","True to the other reviews, the dress truly does run large - I am usually concerned about shift type dresses because of my butt and hips, but I had no problem wearing the 4.","I would size at least one down, maybe 2 if you want it to be a little bit less tent-like.","I really loved wearing the dress for Sunday brunch - lots of compliments, but definitely a dress only the ladies can love :)"
"everyday","Breezy material, perfect for spring or summer.","This Opening Ceremony dress runs on the larger side, with an oversized fit.","Love the print and asymmetrical look.","Perfect for a casual, weekend look.","There is plenty of room in the bust, waist, and hips and you can get away with wearing a standard bra underneath.","At 57, the longest part of the hem hit just above my ankle.","Wear with sandals or heels boots."
"everyday","Very flowy & comfortable!","This top works well with any bust size and allows for comfortable room throughout.","A strapless bra should be worn with this because of the mesh at the top.","The ties on the sides and the buttons in the back were my favorite part."
"everyday","As someone with thicker thighs, I prefer pants that skim my legs rather than cling to them.","These, by Derek Lam, fit the bill.","I dressed mine down with sweaters for effortless chic, but theyd also be great to wear on a night out on the town with heels, a tank, and some statement jewelry.","Bonus: they are so soft and floaty, youll feel like youre walking around in a cloud."
"everyday","cute"
"everyday","Can definitely size down.","Its very roomy."
"everyday","It fit like a thick, cozy sweater.","Im a pretty reliable M, and the M fit just fine.","Comfy, cozy, cute... will definitely rent it again!","I wanted to wear it more, but everyone in my life has definitely seen it this week.","Its memorable!"
"everyday","This jacket was super cute but the fit around my arms were very tight.","I read this in other reviews but decided to give it a try anyway.","It was so tight and stiff around my arms that I only ended up wearing it once."
"everyday","It fit very nicely, and I could eat in it!","!"
"everyday","To short to wear this anywhere but beach / vacation - bummed because its super cute!","!"
"everyday","Pros: Very high quality lace on arms, flattering.","Warm enough for 50-70 degree sunny days.","Cons: tight through midsection, short cut.","Do not rent if long torso."
"everyday","Lets talk about the color of this jacket...a cherry red that is absolutely perfect for the winter season.","The jacket may not be super warm or thick, but that is easily fixed by wearing a sweater underneath.","The belt at the waist and the cape like neck are super great details that are so flattering.","The medium fit me perfectly!","I did not want to give this back, but since I moved to Florida, I had no use for it :("
"everyday","Loved the color and fit of this.","Wore with a pair of white jeans."
"everyday","I expected the dress to be longer (judging by the model picture and my height), but it was about the same length on me as it was on the model.","The dress definitely runs large; Im glad I rented the XS and not the S. It was super comfortable, super cute, totally my style and I might buy it for myself!"
"everyday","This dress is tight across the shoulder blades and probably wouldnt work well for bigger busts.","Otherwise, the material and cut of the dress are fantastic.","I am petite and have a smaller bust; I sized down (I am usually between a 2 and 4 and got the 2), and the waist and skirt fit nicely."
"everyday","I ended up not wearing this jacket because the arms were just too slim for me to be comfortable for an evening.","The waist was nice and I could button comfortably, but the slim arm holes and arms didnt work.","I have muscular arms, so wouldnt recommend if you do as well.","The print was pretty and it would have been nice for the event."
"everyday","this dress is lovely.","it was very comfortable and classy.","i would recoment for work or everyday"
"everyday","Loved this top for everyday wear!","Made me feel elegant but a touch of sexy.","Got a lot of compliments for the shirt.","It definitely needs to be paired with a high waisted item though!"
"everyday","I love the fit and style of this top.","Its relatively warm without being bulky.","My only complaint is the fabric is a bit itchy.","I wore a black bodysuit underneath and that helped.","Will probably rent again."
"everyday","Great piece!","I wore it to a hockey game with black pants and a leather jacket and felt stylish and warm.","The knit is very see through, so I would recommend an undershirt (or not ;) you do you!)"
"everyday","Vibrant colors, runs a bit snug, very form fitting."
"everyday","As per the other reviews, this jacket did run a bit tight in the shoulders and through the chest.","There is no stretch to the main fabric (arms and torso), but the waist was able to stretch.","The color in the pattern is actually metallic, which makes it a bit dressier (for a night out).","I loved the jacket and received a bunch of compliments on it.","But zipping it definitely smashed my boobs."
"everyday","Fits looser like a blouse."
"everyday","This jacket fit well and was nice quality, but it was more reflective and shiny gold overall, not an off-white background as I thought it looked on the model."
"everyday","Fitted sweater and is true to size."
"everyday","I love to layer pieces therefore this is a great one to select if you need something light but warm.","This runs true to size and is great for any body type."
"everyday","Loved this top.","It was super comfortable and easy to wear.","Will definitely rent again and get a  picture in it!"
"everyday","Love the slightly longer length and the winter white color.","I highly recommend!"

"everyday","With leggings, pencil skirt, jeans, its great."
"everyday","fabric is great but does carry a little static"
"everyday","Fits true to size."
"everyday","I loved this dress because of the versatility — wore it as a swimsuit coverup and then turned around and dressed it up with nude strappy heels for work (both times, I got loads of compliments).","I am a size 8/medium and got the small and it was perfect!","Keep in mind it wrinkles VERY easily.","Really fun dress that can be used for various purposes so will definitely rent again when I go on vacation."
"everyday","I never ended up wearing it because it was super long in the front, and it looked like a lab coat on me.","Would look super cute on someone who doesnt have a chest, due to the tight fit in the area, and the length."
"everyday","I recieved a ton of compliments on this coat and it was a nice change from my plain black wool coat.","I would not wear this for temps below 40 degrees, but I was warm enough on a 40ish degree day.","My only grip is that the buttons are snaps which come open kind of easily.","Otherwise great coat!"
"everyday","I newver ended up wearing this because it was just so-so....for me.","Its very girl next door, which I love, but I just wasnt feeling it this time.","I will say that fabric is great, light, and falls nicely.","There is a tie at the waist and it hit just above my knees (Im 55).","Its very simple and pretty.","I just wasnt feeling it."
"everyday","Loved everything about this bomber.","I wish it was mine."
"everyday","I rented this because its a cute, laid back style for weekends.","I love the detailing - the photo makes it look mostly purple but really its a very colorful embroidery.","Fits true to size.","I probably couldve sized up to a Small because XS was a little tight on my chest but the entire look is fitted so you can go either way."
"everyday","I fell in love with this flouncy skirt.","It is fitted in the hips and a perfect length on me being 5 4"
"everyday","I love these pants!","They fit almost exactly how they look on the model, very slimming in the waist.","The material made a bit of a swish, so theyre cool and comfortable.","Im very curvy below the waist and these worked great for my build.","Fit was true to size.","I recommend wearing them with seamless panties since they do show lines in the back with being so straight.","I wore these with a black v-neck sweater and nude heels.","I definitely recommend these pants if youre looking to add something fun to your wardrobe for any occasion!"
"everyday","it was cute, but I didnt really like it"
"everyday","This dress comes with its own detachable slip (nude-colored).","I ended up not wearing that and instead wore a black slip underneath instead.","I wore this with brown suede boots for a fall look.","Its oversized, but that is the style."
"everyday","Im having a hard time sending bak this dress.","I wore it a few times and would like to wear it again.","It is so versatile and so beautiful.","Great fit, gorgeous fabric and beautiful color!"
"everyday","The top is beautiful but it runs very small and it has NO stretch.","The band that goes right under your boobs is smaller than anything else.","Not happy about how small it fits would have loved to wear it."
"everyday","Would suggest ordering one size down from normal"
"everyday","Comfortable, not as long on me as it was in the photo.","Easy to move in and easy to wear."
"everyday","Rented this for work/everyday.","The fabric is great and you can tell it is well made.","It was a fun layering piece and I found myself wearing it a few times.","Would rent again, and purchase if it was so expensive!","Wonderful piece."
"everyday","This piece fit well - I didnt realize that the neckline was cut so low."
"everyday","Definitely size up if you have a large bust!","The top fit me great everywhere, except I could not button it all the way up (I am a 34D).","I had to leave the top few buttons open, and wear it with a tank underneath.","Other than that, super cute top."
"everyday","I wore this to a potluck with my boyfriend.","Its a really neat and comfortable silk top.","If I rented it again I would probably go up a size to the S as the arms werent long enough and it was a little tight in the shoulders.","Im pretty tall and have broad shoulders.","The rest of it fit well.","It has a D ring to tie up the sleeves so I rolled them up above my elbows and it was fine.","You can dress this top up or down easily.","I wore it with jeans and nice sneakers.","I think you could wear it tucked into a skirt or with slacks for the office as well.","Id rent it again."
"everyday","The straps were a bit awkward and although adjustable, couldnt get to lay flat.","Perhaps would have gone down a size to better fit.","Otherwise, really cute design and fabric.","Cute with jeans or cropped pants."
"everyday","Love-would probably buy if the discount offer were better but has been worn too many times from 10% off"
"everyday","This was a different material than I was expecting; I was thinking it would be jersey but its definitely not.","It hangs nicely, but runs HUGE.","Standing in front of the mirror, I pulled the back until the dress was still flowy, but no longer looked like a burlap sack and was holding about 8+ inches of fabric in my hands."
"everyday","Great fit.","Style meant to be loose, but still stylish and comfortable."
"everyday","Rented this for Unlimited.","Came brand new with tags.","Surprised it was a two piece -- the crop top with the tie and the slip underneath.","When you wear it together, you cant tell.","Sadly for me, it was more of a babydoll silhouette and not flattering for my height (just about 55).","The slip was a tad small for me - could just barely zip it up, but since its covered by the top, it didnt matter.","top was a bit snug, but maybe Im just a bigger in the shoulders and back.","Overall, its well made, and with super soft cotton."
"everyday","This is a beautiful summer top.","Its light, breathable, and has such a fun pattern.","I also love that it could be paired with both white and regular wash jeans and can be worn for day or night.","I did end up wearing a white cami with it because it did come a bit low, but I also think if you tie the top tighter, you could probably reduce how low it sit in the front."
"everyday","I ended up not wearing it - the colors were a little too neon, and it hung kind of shapelessly.","Not bad, just never stood out to me that I wanted to wear it after it hung for a week in my closet, so I returned it."
"everyday","Let me start off by saying...","I am a Free People LOVER!","This dress is not sized like a typical Free People piece.","I bounce between a 4-6 and the 6 fit perfect, but if you are on the smaller size in the bust area, the top may be a little big on you.","I am a 34C/D and the top fit me perfect while wearing a demi cut bra.","The dress can be a little short, but I wore it with a pair on tights and thigh high boots and it was a GREAT look!","If you are worried about the open part at the top, a lace bralette would be a great addition.","P.S the sleeves are a little long!"
"everyday","This is a nice skirt.","I wore it to work paired it with a white button down shirt and black wide-width belt.","It was comfortable and didnt shift with constantly getting up and down.","The material is finely knit weave  that hugs you nicely, but not too tight to show imperfections ;-) I would rent this item again."
"everyday","Otherwise theyre very flattering."
"everyday","Versatile and stylish.","Amazing jacket!","I just might keep it.",":)"
"everyday","The sleeves bell out at the wrist.","The fringe is flattering and works well with just about any pant.","Overall, its a very complimentary sweater."
"everyday","It could have been a little of how it fit me but I could see my bra a lot in this, the white/lace part is see through and I didnt realize that.","Maybe it was my bras and the fit but I didnt love how it looked on me.","I did like the neck and how it looked besides that."
"everyday","Easy to wear, great quality, and cute.","It does add a little weight up top, but its so fun to wear I dont care."
"everyday","I took this dress with me on vacation in Mexico.","I loved the print and had read reviews that it didnt wrinkle so decided to give it a try.","I could not have been happier!","I dressed the dress down by wearing it with a jean jacket, and received so many compliments from people that I met while out.","The fit seemed a little loose to me.","I definitely could have gone a size down but was crunched for time.","Even with it being a little bit large, the dress still hung well on my frame!","I wore the dress with sandals and my feet were a little exposed - definitely wouldnt get if you are taller than 5-9!"
"everyday","I love rompers and this one did not disappoint!"
"everyday","Soft fabric, fit well.","Great cut.","True to size, love the pockets!"
"everyday","Amazing - so many compliments.","Im obsessed.","Perfect for NYC fall."
"everyday","My mother and very, very hard-to-please friend gave this a thumbs up, and I think that really says something.","Its such a fun dress and the colours are perfect for the season.","Runs a little big though, so probably go down one (or two) sizes."
"everyday","Loved the slouchy fit, the soft fabric, the pockets, etc.","The turtleneck was a nice height and the body of the sweater didnt stretch out or lose its shape throughout the day.","Great piece for a cold day."
"everyday","This jacket was the perfect layering piece for work and an evening out following.","Great transition piece for a night on the town.","Lots of compliments from coworkers.","Would definitely rent again or purchase."
"everyday","A pretty dress, with a flattering pattern--though I wish the fabric had been of higher quality.","This dress does run a touch small... its very form-fitting--which I dont mind--but it was tight across my shoulders as well as my tummy.","Its impossible to zip up by yourself, FYI.","Not a good rental if you live alone!"
"everyday","material is high quality, it isnt too cropped, works with a mid rise jean.","found it difficult to zip up and tie the sleeves solo, needed to ask for help!","great for the weekend, but too low cut for the office.","www.kayleighharrington.com"
"everyday","The color is a fabulous blue and loved the cut...the top is low cut/sexy."
"everyday","Wore this dress to work and loved how it looked.","Sort of on the casual side but still work appropriate."

"everyday","This dress was so comfortable!","It felt great and fit perfectly.","Will definitely consider renting this one again!"
"everyday","fits great"
"everyday","Cute and comfy!!","This was adorable and the perfect jacket for the fall.","Roomy enough to wear a sweater underneath or a long sleeved shirt.","Length was great in both the torso and sleeves.","The jacket did not have stretch.","If you are looking to layer your look, I would highly recommend sizing up."
"everyday","Really enjoyed this tunic.","I paired it with black leggings and leopard flats.","While it was VERY comfortable I did feel very matronly.","The plus side to this tunic is that it hides any extra lbs hanging on your tummy-area."

"everyday","This shirt was great!","I got two wears out of it, both to work and work events.","The size was perfect – Looked great and fit perfectly for my 34D bust; works best with a racerback bra otherwise straps will slip.","Would like to own a piece like this; have found that Derek Lam stuff fits me quite well."
"everyday","A bit oversized for me, a bit long for me, not as weighty as Id like it to be, and the sewing around the cuff is coming undone  - but - I LOVE THIS COAT.","Its really good looking and warm enough.","Get it if you like a coat that is functional but also makes a statement."
"everyday","looks better in the pic than in real life.","Runs small and looks way to mature."
"everyday","A little tight at the rib cage, but fit great otherwise.","Easy to wear.","Light fabric -- nice for spring or summer."
"everyday","It is a great comfortable fit.","Stretch waist.","No stretch to the material but it flows well."
"everyday","I wore this a few times during the holidays and it is a great, flattering top.","Its not too short or too boxy.","Nice lines and cute sleeves."
"everyday","fit is a bit large- has drawstringlooks professional feels like PJsnice drape good color want to buy them and wish they had them in black on rtr"
"everyday","This was such a fun vest to wear.","Definitely a statement piece, almost a bit of an editorial feel to it.","Very minimal, straight silhouette with stand-out pockets.","I rented this in early spring and paired it with a simple grey dress underneath to let the bright pink pockets shine.","For a colder winter day, Id recommend something like a black or grey turtleneck underneath.","The XS was a perfect fit for me.","Love the oversized pockets.","Could easily fit a ton of stuff in there, and the fur was super soft.","I wore it to work and got compliments on it all day.","It looks a little crazy when you first see it on the website, but its actually super wearable.","So glad I went for it!"
"everyday","I wore this vest 3 times in a week and a half (luckily no overlapping people at the events I was going to)...","I absolutely loved it!","Paired it with a black bodycon and booties for a little dressed up but still cool look for a family affair, with jeans and vans for a day time look, then jeans and booties for a date.","Got so many compliments at each event.","Because of the belt, it definitely looks better zipped and belted, not open.","And, it runs big, so size down."
"everyday","This is a really beautiful sweater with great details.","The sleeves are a bit long, even on me (510) so had to roll them a bit.","Other than that, this was perfect."

"everyday","Excellent dress with a bit of edge.","Stood out in a room full of very fashionable people.","Interesting length that made it unique."
"everyday","I wore this twice - to an afternoon fundraiser on a cloudy rainy day where I was literally the only person in a crowd of about 100 wearing a bright color, and then to work the next week.","I am honestly not sure Ive ever gotten more compliments on an outfit once let alone twice.","Its a really intense bright red/orange - next to both colors it looked more like the other one - and definitely will make you stand out, but in a good way.","Fabric is a decently heavy weight, fit was generous through the hips/rear but didnt gap across the cleavage, very easy to take on/off yourself even in a small bathroom stall.","Id probably go down a size if I was going to buy but thats more because Im right between a 10 and 12 right now and not reflective of the sizing."
"everyday","Absolutely beautiful coat but not practical for everday use because the large shawl collar restricts arm movement."
"everyday","I loved this and the cutouts!","It kept me warm, but not too hot and the sweater has a lot or subtle color.","One thing I will warn; it does have alpaca hair (5%?","), so it can get a little itchy in places.","Size was a little on the small side, but just because it was tight-knit."
"everyday","This was a loose fitting (when worn TTS) sheer blouse.","Perfect with white jeans (as styled here) or cute shorts in the summer time.","Would definitely rent again."
"everyday","The fit was too big.","It fell low on my hips, unlike the model.","I would size down if you want it to fit at the waist."
"everyday","This was such a fun dress to wear.","Its super versatile for all sorts of events and can be dressed up or down.","It actually comes in two pieces, and while I didnt get the chance, you could even wear the top portion with jeans."

"everyday","awesome coast"
"everyday","I loved wearing this dress out to a local brewery for a late lunch after a busy Friday night!","It was perfect to throw on with last nights makeup and a quick hairdo.","This dress was so comfortable and perfect for a cool summer day.","I loved the asymmetrical length (short in the front and longer in the back) because it made me feel confident wearing it out without tights or leggings.","I also wore it as a long shirt to a girls night in later in the evening and got many compliments.","Rent your normal size (size up for back up for length/comfortability)."
"everyday","I loved the frill at the bottom of the shorts, very flattering.","The rise on the crotch seemed a smidgen high but doable.","I had to adjust from time to time though and that was a little annoying.","The patterns adorable though and I got lots of compliments.","All in all, fun for a casual, warm night out."
"everyday","Great everyday wear top that runs true to size.","There is no stretch to the fabric so I would recommend sizing up.","There is comfortable room in the bust - it works well for any cup size.","The flowy sleeves add for a nice touch.","I would pair this with white jeans and heels or sandals!"
"everyday","RTR is turning out to be my best friend during pregnancy.","Im 20 lbs heavier than I usually am, so I got the Medium and the Large, thinking that Id most likely wear the large.","NOPE - the medium fit just fine.","Large was too large!","This at 150 lbs and 54.","I will say it was great for a pregnant woman.","Not too tight and flares out.","Very beautiful dress.","I dont usually purchase lace, because I feel its hard to maintain, so renting it was fun.","Time for the next pregnant dress!"
"everyday","it doesnt look like it will be flattering but it is, just be aware theres really only one button in the middle so it blows open sometimes."
"everyday","The dress is beautiful and the fabric is heavy and feels luxurious, but the dress runs pretty large and doesnt have a lot of structure at the waist.","It would look cute with a belt.","It can be dressed up or down."
"everyday","I loved this jacket, the fabric is so soft and the green really pops.","I am usually a 6/S and I rented a 42, but honestly I think the 40 would have been better."
"everyday","It runs full.","Very roomy torso and arm width.","Cool Cozy sweater, beautiful color and nice design."
"everyday","The dress was comfortable and stylish.","I loved that I didnt need to wear a bra.","The size two fit, but the 4 gave me just a bit extra.","I would definitely rent this again.","Everyone asked where I got it."
"everyday","(Delayed review, I wore this back in February) I loved this dress so much I bought it!","Its super comfortable and the leather skirt takes a simple LBD and gives it a little something extra.","Very cute for a night out/drinks."
"everyday","The shirt fit small.","Im a true 8 or M and I couldnt zip up the 8.","If you are not large busted it may fit more true to size.","In addition to not fitting I did not find it a flattering top with the two longer sides.","It makes you look large in the hips.","I just packed it back up without wearing it."
"everyday","Runs large.","I did not actually wear it but this is good quality fabric and made very well.","IF I were to rent it again I would def go down in size"
"everyday","Awesome pattern, snug fit (I like things fitted).","Its decently stretchy too, so you could size down if you like things tight like me."
"everyday","Loved it.","Very comfortable work dress."
"everyday","Interesting combination of casual (sweatshirt material) and style (ruffle).","Overall, a comfortable top that I wore to work."
"everyday","I did consider buying this one.","I wore it all the time with my unlimited membership.","You can dress it up or down and the color is super original but still easy to combine and trendy.","The material feels expensive and looks expensive as well.","I loved this jacket!","I rented an M and was perfect, I feel an S would have been too tight."
"everyday","Ran a bit large but overall great look.","There is a silk fabric strip that runs down the leg and really ads a polished finish to the look.","It was a bit uncomfortable when sitting, as the collar would pull on my neck if I didnt pull the jumpsuit up before sitting down."
"everyday","I wore it over leggings with boots, it was cute, but not to die for - not very flattering would have been cute in the summer with sandals, may try again"
"everyday","This dress was a Top 10 RTR rental.","It was such amazing quality - both the fabric and construction.","Great snug fit.","I work this to work and then out afterward.","I was soo happy it was available thru my unlimited plan."
"everyday","I love the patterned detail along the edges of this classic chambray wrap dress.","Running true to size, I would recommend sizing up for a fuller bust.","I found that this dress was a little low cut for a larger bust, but you can adjust the tie to accommodate for extra room.","This dress is most fitted at the the natural waist where it is cinched with a tie.","Throw on some sandals and this is the perfect dress for all of your weekend activities!"
"everyday","Flattering fit, nice details, very comfortable.","I got tons of compliments."
"everyday","This is a shorter dress but Im 53 so it hit a little above the knee.","When you sit, it will ride up a little but nothing too revealing.","This dress is formal enough for work but playful enough to go out in afterward.","I thought it sized a lot smaller than other designers Ive tried, and I was aware of the arm holes and neckline, but this didnt affect the overall look.","I loved it and would rent again!"
"everyday","The fit was a little weird for me because im so short and it was also a little big in the bust area,"
"everyday","I loved this skirt.","The pattern was very Ralph Lauren and the weight made it look/ feel expensive.","The hang of the pleating was flattering and didnt create too much volume.","I wasnt able to wear this skirt because it ran so small.","I am a SM/M and ordered the L based on other reviews.","I could barely get the zipper closed!","It looked like other renters had the same problem, as the zipper was definitely wonky from being over-pulled."
"everyday","pros: comfortable cons: shorter than expected"
"everyday","My favorite part of the dress is the beautiful color.","It is a snug shift, if in doubt order up.","I found that the hips fit fine, but was tight through the rib cage and bust (and this is from a B cup!)","Overall loved it."
"everyday","I have a large bust (34DD) and usually wear a 6-8, so I got a M. Because its so flowy, I think I would have been better with a S. Regardless, I wore it three times - once to work, once on a road trip, and once to brunch.","Loved it!","!"
"everyday","The color of this is beautiful in person - pinks and orange with navy trim, not red.","The fabric is thick and comfortable with a lot of stretch.","I love the general idea of this but didnt think it was suited for my body type.","I am tall and the waist hit a bit higher than I would have liked, making it a little short (even with tights), and the arms were a little baggy on me.","The flare-y style could be cute on someone shorter.","I didnt think it was the most flattering, but I really wish I did as I loved the color, fabric and pattern."
"everyday","The material on this jacket is the perfect weight for almost anything.","I have worn it at least 5 times since I got it with my unlimited order.","Its a shame that mine came without the pictured belt.","Thats why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
"everyday","Loved it enough to wear to 3 functions before sending back"
"everyday","The best part is the fabric - delicate, flowing, and fully lined without being bulky and its very breathable so you are not sweating like a piglet!","I liked the delicate pattern on yellow background and the long flowing length.","Off the shoulder is gorgeous too."
"everyday","This dress is very cute with the ribbon-like material and the full zipper up the front.","On me, the 4 was a little to poofy in the bust area.","I think a 2 would have fit great.","I wore it anyway and got lots of positive comments."
"everyday","Wore this for an on-air live TV interview.","Great color and very forgiving.","Not too short."
"formal affair","Im 51, so when I got into the dress it lightly trailed the floor with my 1 1/2 heels.","I didnt wear a bra due to my large bust, but there was no slips or tugging up all the time.","It actually stayed up!","I felt fabulous in this dress and best part, of course, are the pockets!","Material is great, a nice embroidered jacquard that kept me warm during the evening/night event."
"formal affair","I usually wear a size 2 but had to wear the size 4 and even in the bigger size it was extremely difficult to zip up!","My friend had to help me and it took us 20 minutes just to get on."
"formal affair","Fit was true to size.","Toes peek out in front as I expected and didnt agree with other reviews that the dress ran short.","Received many compliments."
"formal affair","Other than the back, the rest of the dress is pretty free flowing so its comfortable to spend a long time in.","Its great for dancing and the detailing on he back is really flattering.","Really loved this dress!"
"formal affair","Fit true to size, Im 56 and wore 4 heels, the long was the perfect length.","LOVED this gown.","If youre over 55 and want to wear 4 or higher heels, GET THE LONG!"
"formal affair","My fiance LOVED this dress!","He wanted me to wear it again for an upcoming event (think I will, but go with blue =)).","It truly is an absolutely stunning dress!","I would HIGHLY recommend this dress for any formal affair!"
"formal affair","The fit of the dress was tight and clingy, although the fabric was thick.","It was very comfortable and stretchy, which I liked.","I am on the shorter side, and it was perfect length.","The v-neck was a bit lower than I would normally wear but fit well."
"formal affair","I had ordered this dress for a sorority formal, and I loved it!","The dress had fit perfectly, and was definitely eye-catching!","I agree with other reviews that the color is rose-gold, and it is beautiful!","I ordered the 4R and the length was perfect, but it did drag a little in the back.","One small con is that it is a little itchy under the arms, but it was not truly noticeable.","I would recommend this dress to any woman who is looking for something to wear for a formal affair!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress so much!","Fits really well!","Get a size smaller is your stomach is the smallest part of your body because thats what holds up the dress!","The color was perfect, it matches gold and silver"
"formal affair","Flattering jumpsuit.","The whole in the chest was loose and gapped, and I am not small chested.","The middle with the waist seams was a bit odd so I chose to wear my backup."
"formal affair","I am so obsessed with this color!","It is absolutely perfect for Fall or Winter.","This gown was amazing quality too, which I was kind of worried about with the mesh.","Sometimes that can look cheap, but this definitely didnt.","This gown looked and felt expensive and high quality.","You definitely cant wear a bra because of how low cut it was, but it had plenty of room, even with a full bust.","It was also the perfect length in a Regular at 55 with about 3 heels.","My typical dress size was a perfect fit!"
"formal affair","I think that the sides of the dress poked out a little and I didnt have fashion tape on hand.","Also it was a little long because I had the regular but not too bad at all."
"formal affair","The dress does not stretch, but it does have a little give to it.","The 2 fit so well, I ended up not even trying the 4 on ( I am usually a 2 or 4 depending on the bust area).","Like all of the other reviews have said, this dress is SHORT!","When you are standing it looks great, just be careful where you sit down.","I probably wouldnt rent this dress for a wedding because of how short it gets when you sit down, but for the event I went to I didnt sit down very long so it was fine.","Definitely order a size up for the backup size.","It fits true to size, but a little on the small side.","It really is a fantastic dress.","It is so flattering and I got compliments all night.","Photographs well!"
"formal affair","After my original dress never arrived (from another website), this last minute order definitely saved me!","It was absolutely beautiful, I actually liked it more!","I usually wear a 4, but this dress was a little tight in the chest so I went with a 6.","However, the dress was a little too long (it was around two inches two long with three inch heels).","All in all, I loved the dress and so did my friends!","So happy with my order!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress as I hosted the Maxim red carpet this past weekend.","The bright colors looked amazing on camera and it was very comfortable to wear.","The size fit perfectly but Ive experienced some Herves stretch out so I would recommend renting a size smaller if you have the chance.","The part I loved most about this dress was the zippered back."
"formal affair","Love a dress thats BRA FRIENDLY!","Also a fan of the high/low hemline as you never have to worry about tripping over your gown.","Good for dancing.","Very comfortable and while low key, the fabric has some nice texture and sparkle to make it pop a bit."
"formal affair","This was a very pretty dress, the gold lace overlay was gorgeous.","I received lots of compliments on it.","The built in bra was great, with that you dont need anything else.","The length was perfect for me, Im 57 and wore it with 2in heels and it skimmed the floor.","The arms are a bit tight which is why I went with the bigger size, normally Im a 10 or 12."
"formal affair","The color is as shown in the picture.","The sleeves are not gold as pictured.","The dress runs a little large I wish there were a 00."
"formal affair","Looked great on.","Felt good all night.","Was long, even with heels.","There was a slip that had to be adjusted from underneath or it would wrinkle.","You have to find it.","The zipper was sticky"
"formal affair","I LOVED this dress!!","I wore it to a military ball, and it was PERFECT.","I felt extremely elegant the entire night, and I received quite a few compliments on the dress.","This dress hugs in all the right places, and is super flattering.","A few other ladies have said that they had an issue with the tail of the dress coming undone, but I had no problems with it at all.","(Though, be sure to order the correct size, because this dress does NOT stretch.)","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone going to a formal event!"
"formal affair","Just the right about of tight, little slits at sides, very beautiful."
"formal affair","I kept getting compliments all night.","It does run a little large though, Im usually a 4 in pants and dresses.","Based on reviews, I decided to size down to a 2 for my backup size and luckily I did because I didnt even try the 4 on since the 2 fit perfectly right out of the bag.","It looks really classy because of the length, but the slight and neckline make it a little more fun.","If youre on the fence about renting this dress, seriously just do it!","If it werent way out of my price range for a dress, I would completely consider purchasing it, its that amazing."
"formal affair","It fit beautifully.","Definitely true to size.","Im 58 and wore the dress with 3 inch heels.","The zipper was terrible, but that may have been just a flaw in this particular gown.","Theres a ton of fabric in the skirt, it flowed beautifully when I walked.","The slit started about mid thigh, and wasnt noticeable until you are sitting or walking.","I really loved this gown!"
"formal affair","I adore this dress.","Looking at it online, I never would have been attracted to this dress.","My original dress was too short so I hopped into the Flatiron RTR store and a stylist picked this out for me.","It wasnt until I zipped it up that I felt the magic of this dress.","The color is a rich fuchsia, the long length option is perfect for tall girls in heels, and the fit is tight but smooths out trouble areas.","I gained a little weight this fall and still felt incredible in the dress.","To top it all off, the backside makes you look bootylicious but not to the degree that its inappropriate for formal functions (I wore this to a gala where I was meeting with our major donors)."
"formal affair","I went to the store in Georgetown store the week before my prom to get a dress, and was set on this one.","Unfortunately, since it was so last minute, I couldnt get my size of 0R, so I had to get the 0L and another dress in case it was too long.","However, I wore the 0L in this dress anyways, and it still was lovely!","Overall great dress."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to my prom and overall it was beautiful!","I got compliments all night on the dress and even for a few days afterward.","Im short, but very busty (36 DDD), and the length of the dress was fine with heels on.","The only problem I had was with the neckline.","I expected it to be low and took others advice of using some fashion tape to hold it in, but it didnt stay where I wanted it too.","Im used to showing more cleavage than someone with a smaller bust, but if this is something that would bother you, keep in mind that the dress does not stretch at all and can only cover so much."
"formal affair","I wore this gown to a black tie holiday party.","It was definitely a gorgeous dress, but I am 510 and the dress was too short for me so I had to end up wearing flats.","I normally where a size 6, but the only dress they had in a longer length in the store was a 10.","So after some pinning and a padded bra, it fit(ish)!","Overall, I loved the dress but was pretty disappointed in the length."
"formal affair","I ordered this dress as my back up dress and ended up wearing it.","It was super flattering to my curvy figure and I loved the off the shoulder detail and the back of the dress is really flattering as well.","I tried on the 10L and the length was to the middle of my calf which really scared me as I didnt see how the 12L would be much longer but thankfully it was perfect!","Huge difference in length between the two of them.","Im 57 and I was wearing a 3 inch heel.","I love the little train on the gown, it was perfect!"
"formal affair","I rented this for an annual gala event that has a theme.","This year was a vintage-themed party around KCs heyday of the Jazz era.","I am NOT a basic black dress person but rented it because I thought it looked like it would evoke a vintage glam look while flattering my figure (which a flapper cut would not).","My size has been changing frequently; I have a 14-month old and am nursing, so I wasnt sure what to order.","I wear a 12P jeans but recently bought a 10P dress from Ann Taylor, and tried on 8 regular formal dresses that fit but didnt flatter.","The 10P was too big but the 8P was perfect.","I wanted to be comfortable and dance so the 8P hit just shy of my shoe toes.","If I wanted it to fit right I would have been fine in the regular.","But I wanted it slightly short so I wouldnt step on it."
"formal affair","Absolutely amazing.","I felt like a glowing star all night.","Elegant, classy, yet a statement piece!","As I gave a toast at my medical school graduation, people literally told me I looked like I was accepting an Oscar.","On behalf of the Academy...thanks RTR!!",":)"
"formal affair","This was my backup style.","It was very comfortable to wear great length for me, but might run a little short for those looking to wear very tall heels.","The fabric itself is not super forgiving and little nooks and crannies do show, it also does not feel super soft, but the color is deep and lovely and overall its a very wearable dress that you can feel comfortable in."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater, and I received numerous compliments!","The dress is very elegant, and I love the manner in which it flows.","The fit was great, very comfortable.","I rented a size 2R, and it fit me perfectly.","The length was great, and the fact I had on 4.5 inch heels helped.","Simply put, this dress was a dream, and people would not stop complimenting me on how gorgeous it was.","I felt like a princess!"
"formal affair","Style: I absolutely loved this dress!","The lace was delicate and full of glitter, perfect for an evening fundraiser.","The pattern was unique and the deep v in the back was sexy, yet appropriate.","Fit: When I ordered, a size 8 wasnt available and from the other reviews I felt a 10 would fit me best.","I probably would have been better off with an 8, but I liked it anyway.","The skirt fit well, but the top was a tad big, along with the cap sleeve.","Con: The cap sleeve was too big, but I doubt anyone noticed but me."
"formal affair","ADORABLE Dress!","This dress is outside my comfort zone however I just adored it.","Fits lovely.","Dress fit true to size.","Fabric has some stretch.","Recommend sizing up when choosing backup size."
"formal affair","The 10 didnt fit so I would say this dress runs small since I wear a 10 in everything.","I also have wide shoulders and ribcage so the 12 fit great there.","The dress was a little short so I wore small heels.","The style was flattering and the color is extremely pretty.","It definitely does get itchy and there are pieces along the ribs that rub in a lot when dancing, so I wasnt comfortable dancing for very long.","Overall it received so many compliments and I would do RTR again!"
"formal affair","Strangers were complimenting on this all night long.","I didnt want to give it back."
"formal affair","FIT - I tend to have a problem finding dresses that fit well.","Given that I just had a baby 6 months ago, not everything seems to be as it use to be :) That being said, I still fit into a 4, but reserved both the 4 & 6.","I am also at a height that puts me in between regular and long.","At 56, most regular sized dresses are great for length and 3 inch heel.","I had to go with the long, the regular was all rented out.","With that being said I had to wear 6 inch heels.","The dress hugged everything perfectly, and the top stayed up with no problem.","I am not well endowed so I normally get a little nervous with strapless dresses.","But this wasnt a problem.","PROS - quick turn around from the staff at RTR.","I couldnt decide if I wanted to rent or buy for this Gala.","I kept going back and forth.","I sent several e-mails to the stylist, they responded quickly and gave me all the info I needed.","I was so happy I rented!","CONS - I was silly, and didnt read the full description of the dress.","There is a TRAIN.","And if youe like me and rented the long instead of the regular and you are in between sizes.","The long is LONG.","I had 6 inch heels on and the dress still had length to it (the train part), so careful when you walk, the second size they sent me, it looked as if someone may have put a heel through the dress.","I contacted them, and they responded immediately.","And have taken care of the situation.","Even though the dress was long and had a train.","I cant really complain.","All in all great dress!","I cannot wait to rent again!","Not sure Ill ever buy another dress ;) Thank you staff at RTR, saved me some serious cash and made me look/feel beautiful!","B"
"formal affair","I rented this dress for my companys dinner event.","I rented a 6 and an 8, and while the 6 fit great, my boobs were really out there.","Since this was a work event, I erred on the cautious side and went up to the 8.","Even then the neckline is pretty low.","I used a lot of fashion tape to keep the neckline against my skin.","The heavy fabric of the dress just hugged my body and I felt great in this dress."
"formal affair","This dress does not photograph well, but it is very pretty.","The long sleeves and high neck are great for winter.","The hem in one sleeve was pulled out and had been repaired with red hem tape, which was strange.","This is jersey fabric,  so it is stretchy and there were a couple small holes in the shoulder.","I originally wasnt going to wear a necklace, but the dress felt very plain and dark without, so I added some sparkle."
"formal affair","Fit was perfect.","Tried two dresses before this, but they were both too short.","Thankfully, the stylist sent this dress overnight in time for the event.","Greatly appreciate it."
"formal affair","So stunning in person!","Beautiful navy lace & flattering fit!","My first rental and now Im hooked!"
"formal affair","I am normally a four, but I have broad shoulders so I had to resort to the size 6R.","I recommend if you have broad shoulders you size up.","The way the dress is shaped, you will still have a nice hour glass frame."
"formal affair","The hem was ripped on the inside of the back of the skirt when I received it.","I put double-sided tape on the fabric and it held all night.","The fit at the waist is tight on this dress but the cut is so forgiving.","Would definitely rent this dress again."
"formal affair","It hit just above my knee, made my boobs look great (plus I could wear a bra which was perfect!","), and was perfect for homecoming!"
"formal affair","I dont know why they are listing these as R -- they are definitely tall, and the length given in the description is not accurate.","I spent a good 45 minutes with an iron and fashion tape and made it work, but I would not go through that effort again!","Its sad because otherwise this is a completely awesome jumpsuit.","I wore it with a lacy tank underneath.","Im between a 4 and a 6 and was worried about it being tight on my hips so went with the 6, but should have done the 4 I had plenty of room and was kind of swimming around in it.","But thats also kind of the look.","Id recommend for people over 59 or who can get there with heels, and wish Id trusted the other reviewers that RtRs description was way off."
"formal affair","I wore this to The Foundling gala party.","I read the reviews and sized down to a 2 so it would fit in the waist, I am usually a 4.","Perfect fancy event length dress for short girls like me, as someone who is barely 5.","I loved the colors...the high-low hem..the v-neck..the satiny, silky fabric.","It just made me feel so fancy!","The tulle underneath does feel kind of plasticky but not a big deal."
"formal affair","Way too short."
"formal affair","The top part did not hug me very well, but it hugged me well every where else so I would say its true to size!","Very comfortable and if youre looking for something different this is the jumpsuit for you!"
"formal affair","Im a true fan of pretty dresses that happen to have pockets!","The lace was a very nice quality and I love the way ML hugs my curves in a way that makes me feel and look feminine.","You will need a bra with a deep plunge or other alternative (sans/?)","bra since the front and back dip low.","Gorgeous cocktail dress :)"
"formal affair","The cut is great -- slim but not confining.","Beautiful lace.","I wore it with flesh-toned patent slingbacks.","The advisor at the store suggested I not wear a necklace, just earrings and a bracelet, so as not to compete with the lace at the neckline, but if I rented it again I think I would wear a simple jeweled choker.","And the customer service is outstanding at RTR."
"formal affair","There is no boning or ribbing within this dress-- what you see is what you get!","I was concerned that it would look bad in the midsection, but I dont think it did.","I wore spanx   :)   I liked this dress, but another woman at the event had on the same one which put a damper on it for me.","With a dress this flashy it is definitely obvious when there is someone else in the same one.","I spotted her the minute I walked in."
"formal affair","This dress looks amazing and fits really well.","The material is very flattering and hugs you in all the right places.","I felt confident mingling with fancy upper class New Yorkers and got lots of compliments!","Im 55 and the dress was long; I wore 2-3 inch heels and that made it fit just right, but the shoes became pretty uncomfortable later on.","The beading can also rub a little big under the arms, so if youre going to be doing a lot of dancing, consider something else.","This was perfect for my occasion.","I styled it a little differently than this picture, but you will get the idea."
"formal affair","As other reviewers have already said, this dress runs a bit large - I usually wear a size 6, but the size 4 was a better fit in this dress.","Its a classic silhouette, but the little front cutout and the yellow print make it special.","The fabric was extremely comfortable and is smoothing; I wore a bra without problem.","Would rent again!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress for a formal Christmas ball; we live in Minnesota so of course the weather was in the single digits and it was snowing - this dress was plenty warm for a wintry evening.","Very comfortable, lined, and very flattering with the a-line shape.","I ordered both a 6L and 8L, and ended up wearing the 8L as it was just a bit more comfortable in the bust/arms area.","I am 511, and was able to wear this dress with 3 1/2 heels with no problem."
"formal affair","I loved this dress.","Its sexy, eye-catching, classy and structured.","I wore a padded strapless bra to give my barely B-cup bust a lift."
"formal affair","Fits true to size"
"formal affair","Wore this for a work holiday party.","So comfortable and loved the pockets!"
"formal affair","Originally I ordered a 4R because thats my original and regular dress size, but I actually ended up wearing the 6R because the other size would not even get over my hips!","I was overdressed for the event, but I didnt care because the dress that I was wearing was classic and super flattering on.","I wore a strapless bra with it and it was perfect.","Highly recommend getting a spray tan or applying some self tanner so that you dont look washed out with the nudeish-tan-pink color !","!"
"formal affair","I usually wear a size 10, but due to recent surgery and lack of exercise, I ordered a 12 and it was perfect.","Very comfortable, very pretty."
"formal affair","I am petite for my height, it was too big around the waist at 2, too small at 0.","Either way they were wearable just not ideal.","I chose the 2 and was pleased with its performance, it was a very classy length.","Will be renting again soon."
"formal affair","i typically wear a 4, however, i was able to fit into a 2 as its the only size the showroom had.","The dress was a perfect mix of being sexy and glamorous, tight but not too tight.","Would highly recommend for more formal cocktail parties and NYE dresses!"
"formal affair","This dress is fantastic for those looking to find the perfect dress for a formal affair.","The style of the dress draws in your waist and accents your curves, and the mermaid flare is not too much (you wont look like Ariel).","Im 58 and wore the 6L with 4 inch heels.","I didnt trip on the dress, and it was still long enough to cover my shoes.","The train in the back might need some tending to-- in crowded spaces, be weary of people stepping on it.","I loved this dress, but bustier women beware-- theres not a whole lot of room for your girls.","I dont have a big bust, so this dress did wonders for me.","The fabric doesnt give a whole lot, so be sure to size up one if you are especially curvy.","My normal size is a 4, but I needed a size 6 for my hips (Im a 27-inch waist).","Overall, its a great dress and I would definitely wear it again!"
"formal affair","Fits really nice, a tad on the conservative side - very good pick for a formal affair.","The color is beautiful."
"formal affair","Cant say enough about how many compliments I got on this dress.","I wasnt sure if I would like it but it was a hit!"
"formal affair","This dress was a back-up when my style was available.","i was hesitant because of the tie/halter type thing on the front.","However, I ended up getting a lot of compliments on it.","The fabric was nice and it was comfortable and easy to dance/sit in.","My biggest issue was that my boobs (which are a D cup) were just in your face, which is why a lot of the compliments came from men....So based on the kind of event, this dress could be great or just a bit too much."
"formal affair","I ended up wearing a different dress that I had rented just because this was just a little short for the occasion.","Would rent again for a different event"
"formal affair","Really liked how the dress looked on but I am 5 ft 4 and it was a little short in the front.","I would recommend getting a 4L if youre my size or taller!"
"formal affair","The dress ran a bit on the small and short side - I usually wear a size 4, and I got the backup size 6L just in case.","Thank goodness I did as the 4R was too tight around the chest and much too short for me to wear with any heel.","The 6L was also a bit short with my high heels, but it was perfect for when I was wearing flats.","The sleeves were also quite tight and a bit short, so I definitely recommend sizing up (or at least opting in for a large backup size just in case).","Beautiful dress, though!","!"
"formal affair","This dress fit like a glove.","I have absolutely no complaints.","It looks even better in person.","The dress is definitely a highlight on its own; you dont really need much jewelry.","Make sure that the dress falls as close to the floor as possible.","You should NOT really be able to see your  feet.","They should just peek out of the dress."
"formal affair","Love this lace Alexis dress!","The fabric has stretch so its perfect for a full night of dancing and celebrating.","It does run true to size but because of the stretch I would have liked to try a size smaller.","The medium was perfect though and would have been great for an event, but I feel like the small may have a better fit in the bust.","Definitely recommend this style for most body types!","It feels very sexy but also appropriate for a variety of occasions.","LOVE!"
"formal affair","It fit like a glove and I was showered w compliments the whole night!","I definitely have to buy this dress, love this website what an awesome idea!","Thanks so much!"
"formal affair","Im obsessed with this dress!","I wish I owned it!","Super comfortable and a beautiful color."
"formal affair","I loved this outfit, and I got a ton of compliments on it!","Worn with nude heels and statement earrings.","I can typically a 2 and the 2 worked for me in this jumpsuit as well.","Id ordered the 0 as a back up size, but it was too tight in the armpits, and too short + tight in the legs.","The 2 was a much looser and had a more flowy fit, while still looking elegant.","Highly recommend!"
"formal affair","I debated between the 6 and the 4 but I think overall the 6 was the right fit.","Though the waist could have been slightly tighter for a more hourglass figure I dont think the bust would have fit in a size 4 (and Im small chested too!).","I wore it to a sit down formal affair so was happy that it wasnt too tight as some reviewers had experienced.","The dress was slightly long, Im 55 and wore 3.5 heels but it was manageable.","The print and fabric are lovely and I received tons of compliments."
"formal affair","Felt great in this dress!","Ordered the M and L and both fit but I wore the bigger size to give me more room to dance.","Looks great on, and has elastic in the top to accommodate a larger chest.","Perfect for dancing and having fun without having to worry about any wardrobe issues.","Wore it without a bra because the strapless bra looked weird in the back, but I had no issues since the fit was good on the top!"
"formal affair","I loved, loved, loved this dress.","I got compliments all night and a lot of va-va-voom comments.","It was certainly a show-stopper.","I am a 38DDD and it definitely showcased the girls.","I was able to wear a normal bra and just pin the straps so they werent seen.","The length was great to wear with some 4 heels.","The material is stretchy through the hips and chest but heavy enough to hide problem areas.","Wore it with spanx for a smoother look."
"formal affair","The 4R was slightly snug (my fault, not the dresses) so I wore the 6R and had plenty of room to dance and have the dessert.","Highly recommend!","!"
"formal affair","The fit is true to size and the dress looks EXACTLY like it does in the photos.","No surprises here.","Its pretty conservative which was a good fit for the event I went to but I didnt feel like there was a wow factor, which I missed.","There is a built in mini-corset so you dont need stickies or nipple covers.","Im a 4 in most dresses and I had a little bit of room left but not enough to go down a size.","The dress does NOT stretch so if youre snug in a size, order the next size up as your backup.","Dress came up to right above my knees and covered all cleavage.","The V of the neck is not deep.","All in all, it was good for my event, I wasnt disappointed but probably not a re-order for me."
"formal affair","This dress was very comfortable and classy.","I usually dont like to wear things that are tight to my body but this dress was slimming and made me feel good!"
"formal affair","It was too long for me.","I am 53 and it would have required massive heels and a platform.","If I were 55 or taller I think it would have worked.","It would have been vey comfy for a formal gown.","It is stretchy.","and very different."
"formal affair","Waist was tighter than I expected.","Hard to zip up.","Length was good for a 1.5 to 2 inch heel."
"formal affair","The dress was very flattering.","I recently had a baby, and you could hardly notice my belly.","I was worried the cut outs were going to show too much skin, but they were not too big and looked great.","The length was perfect with 3 inch heels."
"formal affair","This dress was a show stopper!","I felt so elegant and gorgeous in it.","It hugged my curves just right and had the perfect amount of stretch to fit my body.","I would totally rent this dress again.","Im officially addicted to RTR.","They always come through when I need them.","Thanks again...","I was so happy in this dress!"
"formal affair","I did not wear a bra with this dress, and it worked just fine.","No issues with the beading on my under arms as some had mentioned.","The pockets were great!"
"formal affair","This dress is beautiful.","The fit is amazing and it will make you feel like royalty....lol"
"formal affair","This was my first Rent the Runway experience and I was very impressed!","The dress was beautiful and the service was fantastic.","I was really nervous because Im very picky and dont like the way most things look on me, but I was desperate for a dress after not finding anything I liked in multiple stores, so I decided to give it a try.","I ordered the 8 and the 10, not knowing what my normal size was.","I got the 8 on but it was very tight in the waist.","I could have worn it but I preferred to have some room to breathe, so I wore the 10.","Unfortunately the zipper on the 10 was pretty terrible (it also seemed to be coming off the dress), but after about 15 minutes of 4 people helping me, we finally got it up.","The dress looked great and I loved the pockets!","So nice to not have to bring a purse!","I also loved the little bit of poof at the bottom, it was really fun for dancing!","One thing I didnt love was that the lace over the chest didnt lay flat, probably because Im more of a petite and it was intended for someone taller/with broader shoulders.","It wasnt too big of a deal though, it still looked nice in pictures and I forgot about it quickly."
"formal affair","Fit like a glove!","I stopped into Neiman Marcus last minute and even though I was interested in a simple, sophisticated yet sexy number, I opted for this gold and shiny sequined option almost immediately after I draped it over my body.","I paired it with 4 silver sandals as you couldnt tell what was underneath the gown and my Rent the Runway specialist approved my idea to mix metallics.","Shine bright ladies!"
"formal affair","The dress is beautiful but strange.","The darts are very, very low and it hung weirdly.","Thankfully my daughter has long hair so you could not see the bunching in the darts."
"formal affair","This dress is definitely tight, short, and hot.","And hot in both heat and looks.",":)  I wore this to a fashion event in DC and was very comfortable outside in 55 degrees with no coat.","Inside I was very warm.","It was much thicker than I expected but it does suck it all in.","Very short and sexy, careful of it riding up.","Id go one size up."
"formal affair","the dress fit beautifully, but was snug up top.","definitely best for a formal event."
"formal affair","The fabric and dress were beautiful, not right for my body shape.","Did not use."
"formal affair","fit well.","6 was a little tight but 8 too big.","I wore 3 heels and the length was just right.","The slit up leg goes pretty high so be aware if wearing Spanx etc."
"formal affair","the 4 fit, but since I was attempting go for a cocktail look and not club i wore the 6.","I wont say it runs small, cause Id been eating all day and the 4 DID fit, i just wanting it looser look.","Great dress.","Really cute and classy and the back gives it some extra fun.","Got lots of compliments from women of all ages."
"formal affair","I absolutely LOVED this gown!","It was the perfect blend of comfortable and sexy.","My event was at the end of February so the dress was perfect for a formal event in cold weather.","The dress fit pretty true to size and hugged all the right places.","Just a tip, there is this extra piece of fabric on the left hip that I didnt really understand.","It didnt affect how I felt about the dress at all, but I never really saw it in any of the pictures.","One of my favorite things about this gown is that it can either be dressed up with a statement necklace or left alone with simple earrings and strappy shoes.","Im not much of a jewelry person so I loved that I didnt have to worry about it.","Id definitely recommend this gown!","Its stunning and received a ton of compliments!","!"
"formal affair","Loved it.","Color is vibrant, and the fit is modest, but very feminine.","Would rent it again any day."
"formal affair","Absolutely my favorite dress yet from RTR!","It fit me like a glove and was really comfortable.","The built-in support in the front of the dress is more than enough if you have a smaller chest.","The mesh panel is a great detail that adds enough flair and fun without being too revealing.","I got compliments all night and felt AMAZING!"
"formal affair","The dress is absolutely true to size.","Being petite and full figured, I was nervous about ordering such a form fitting strapless dress.","HOWEVER, it is so well made, comfortable and flattering, I felt like gold all night!","The shimmer on this dress is stunning.","While the sequins is a bit picky, its nothing painfull.","I could move around in this dress without restriction."
"formal affair","Perfect dress for hourglass figure.","Hugs the curves but oh so elegant.","I received many compliments and felt like a queen."
"formal affair","This dress is super cute, but it was a little too loose on me.","I got a 0 because that is my usual size, but I probably shouldve gotten the 00.","If the fit had been better, it wouldve been perfect!"
"formal affair","This dress was an unbelievable find.","It is the perfect dress for any formal event - the length and sleeves were classy, but the low back added the perfect amount of sex appeal.","A real bombshell dress.","I got so many compliments - might have to buy this to own.","Highly recommend!!","!"
"formal affair","I felt so sexy and confident in this dress!","I was worried about not finding a bra that would work, but a regular strapless bra worked perfectly."
"formal affair","Dress is beautiful.","This dress was the perfect choice for a Mardi Gras Ball.","Being short, I was a little worried about renting a gown that I couldnt get altered, however the length was perfect with 1 heels on.","Fabric is heavy.","Arms are a little tighter than expected, but not too uncomfortable."
"formal affair","Like the previous reviewers said, the dress runs large and long.","I ended up wearing the 8, although I may have been able to go a size smaller.","The dress was gorgeous and both arrived in mint condition.","I usually have problems in the chest department, but it fit perfectly there!","I will say the side zipper bubbled a bit on both sizes, due to the weight of the fabric, but I was told no one else would notice it.","I wore 3 heals and the dress skimmed the floor nicely.","All in all a great process - the mail return bag doesnt fit in all mail slots well ( I ended up jamming up our box so the post office may not be too happy with me)."
"formal affair","Fit true to size.","Has boning and was snug enough up top that I didnt need to wear a bra with it (which is always nice for a busty 34D girl).","Very classy and elegant.","I got compliments ALL NIGHT LONG in this dress!","Even prettier in person, but photographs pretty well.","I am pretty curvy, so it is sometimes hard to look classy and not too overly sexual--this was a perfect dress to achieve that goal for a Black Tie Optional wedding at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead.","I am also pretty short, but 3-4 inch heels worked well for me with this dress.","Thanks RTR!","Would certainly rent this one again!"
"formal affair","This dress is so flattering and I got so many compliments.","I wore it with large turqouise earrings for a pop of color.","My only complaint is that it fit generously all over except in the arm hole, that was slightly snug."
"formal affair","Thick fabric makes this dress very forgiving!","Loved the color, but does need some statement jewelry to really make it shine."
"formal affair","Formfitting but comfortable, felt great in it.","Received complements all evening.","Perfect for a formal work event with its high neck line and longer hem, yet still a little sexy."
"formal affair","I didnt end up wearing this dress, but it was very cute!","It was my runner-up dress.","It fit great, true-to-size and was comfortable, although pretty short (and Im only 54!)","I really wish I had been able to wear this for something else, but I will definitely consider renting it in the future!"
"formal affair","I was very long!","I was wear platform heels and it still dragged on the ground all night, but I am really short so I probably should have steered towards the petite.","Besides that it was amazing, I have never felt more elegant."
"formal affair","The dress wa above and beyond in elegance.","I requested a size 0, but the 2 worked jsut fine with a tuck in the should under the ruffle where no=one was the wiser.","I loved the longer length inthe back.","Beautiful!"
"formal affair","This is my first RTR order and I was a bit nervous about the fit.","But this dress fit perfectly!","It was a bit long even with heels but nothing unmanageable.","Very comfortable and sexy.","The ruffles help hide any unflattering mid-sections.","The only con was the zipper would get stuck half way up.","But once zipped up, the dress is perfect!"
"formal affair","I loved the neck cut out on this dress.","It shows your curves in all the right places.","Unfortunately, Im a bit too much of a pear to make it work just right.","If I were a half a size smaller on the bottom and a half a size bigger on top it would have been perfect.","I didnt end up choosing this for my event but was kind of sad it didnt work out."
"formal affair","I got compliments all night on the dress and it was super comfortable and fit perfectly.","Not a single complaint!","(Wore ~2 inch heels and it was just the right length.","Anything taller than 3 inch heels and it would have been a bit too short.)"
"formal affair","I had to find a dress last minute for a formal event.","I was worried because there was no back-up size available for this dress, but according to previous reviews that stated it fit true to size, I decided to take a chance.","It was completely worth it!","The dress fit true to size.","The color and material does hug curves, but does so tastefully.","My biggest difficulty was with the length.","Even with my highest heels the train of the dress still touched the floor and I was holding the dress up to walk and dance.","I would definitely order this dress again!"
"formal affair","Loved the racerback--felt confident no straps would fall, wouldnt pop out, etc.","Lace is beautiful, has delicate gold edge throughout.","Really comfy, too.","Felt stunning and confident."
"formal affair","The top fit and I could zip the whole thing, but I got crease marks across the tops of my thighs almost instantly, and there wasnt really enough room for my butt.","I admit, I have an ample one... you might want to size up in this dress."
"formal affair","This was my first dress rental and it was flawless.","Dress arrived on time and fit perfect.","I am 6 foot tall so height is always an issue.","I received so many compliments."
"formal affair","Worked perfect for a military ball.","Fits perfect in the chest, waist and length.","Recommend the long if you are over 57 and want to wear heels.","Definitely will rent again!"
"formal affair","It was pretty and elegant and sucked me in everywhere it needed to except up top.","Everything from the chest down fit perfectly.","The chest up, not so much.","I had boob spillage coming out of the arm holes."
"formal affair","I was so disappointed that I could not wear this dress.","The zipper was difficult to move (up or down), and would stick in a couple spots.","In the end, the dress was just too small in the bodice.","I am big busted, but the issue was lower down - around the mid chest.","Oddly, the alternative dress I rented in the same size (both size 10) was too big!","I phoned RTR in a panic, as it was late Friday evening when I was able to try on the dress.","They outdid themselves to assure I would have a great dress to wear to my event.","Sad about the dress, but pleasantly surprised with the level of customer service."

"formal affair","I with I had ordered a 16L as the dress was surprisingly short in the front, other than that the dress was absolutely wonderful.","It is very flattering in all the right places.","I would highly recommend this dress."
"formal affair","Really popped in a crowed.","The cutout on the waist was a little too high for my body type.","I have a large bust so had to wear a bra.","I was able to wear one (with a connector piece in the back to hide the straps).","But the bra kept showing at the top of the cutout.","So I was self-conscious all night, so didnt like it.","Leg slit wasnt too high, hit at the right place."
"formal affair","Would definitely size up and know that it tends to run very short.","Im 59 and it was basically the length of my fingertips.","Definitely rides up when you sit.","You may be pulling it down all night but in my opinion its worth it."
"formal affair","Love the gold - a great twist on the LBD.","Received many compliments!","The fabric is not very forgiving, it was a bit tight around the chest, but worth it."
"formal affair","This dress runs true to size, however I have bigger legs so it was a little more tight through that area.","Everyone loved it and it is a great staple for any occasion you need to wear white."
"formal affair","Had a small issue with the zipper its hard to zip up."

"formal affair","I wore this dress for my sons bar mitzvah party.","It is gorgeous!","It was actually my back-up dress, but I ended up liking it even more than my original choice.","As other reviews noted, it is very fitted and has no give.","Putting it on was a little scary because it felt like it wasnt going to fit, but once it was zipped, it felt like an elegant glove.","It is a bit heavy, but I was comfortable and able to dance as much as I wanted.","I got as many compliments on the dress as I did on my sons performance!"
"formal affair","This dress was beautiful!","I received compliments all night.","This dress was a bit short and I ended up wearing the long, but defiantly worth it."
"formal affair","I wore this for Prom 2013, and everyone there loved it!","Lets just say you wont regret getting this dress.","I got a 0R but was pretty long on me.","Not a big deal, I just got some fashion tape, and fixed the bottom.","I am 51 to be exact!","In the pictures, I am wearing  5 inch heels."
"formal affair","This was an absolutely wonderful choice for a black tie wedding!","It was so comfortable to wear and so flattering -- I received compliments all night from friends and strangers alike.","I loved the weight of the dress for a winter wedding (fabric is on the heavier side) as well as the ruffle on the shoulder.","This dress fit me perfectly -- not too tight but still form flattering.","However, I rated this dress as running large because there is a little extra fabric in the torso area and across the chest.","I am a big busted lady (34 F) so if I think theres room in the bust then that probably means that the dress runs large on most ladies!","The 8L was also perfect length: with three inch heels there was just enough room between the dress and the floor that the dress didnt drag.","Big shout out to the customer service department who found this dress for me as a replacement for a previous order that didnt fit!","I couldnt have been more pleased."

"formal affair","This dress was great!","This was my first time to rent from RTR and I will definitely rent again.","I started off thinking I needed a size 4L.","Im top heavy and have curves.","My backup size was the 2L and it fit like a glove, but wasnt too tight.","It was long enough for me to wear pretty high heels and my toes still didnt show.","The embellishments on top were a little itchy, but not that bad."
"formal affair","Loved this dress!","Very comfortable, unique, and beautifully colorful.","I received many compliments on this dress and would even venture to buy it, if I could!","The only problem was the bust area - I would have loved some double-sided tap to ensure my dress stayed in the proper place while dancing!"
"formal affair","Fits like a glove and very comfortable!","Great support in the dress without a bra and accentuates the bust line very nicely.","Only downside is that the lace gets caught on everything, and you have to be very careful not to tear the lace.","Was also not easy to dress in due to the lace.","But loved the dress!"
"formal affair","I basically chose to wear another RTR dress (the choice was difficult..but I basically flipped a coin).","I only had one concert to go to and 3 dresses, so I had to make an executive decision.","This dress is very comfortable and fits pretty true to size.","I would definitely order down one size if you are unsure.","I normally wear size 2-4 dress and the 2L fit great with 3.5 inch heels."
"formal affair","This dress fit me like a glove, and I got compliments all night!","Im about 59 and wore about 2.5-inch heels to the event.","Even with those heels, the dress was long enough!","Thats HUGE in my world.","The mesh is just the right amount of see through which keeps the dress sexy AND classy.","The only thing I struggled with was bra situation.","I used one of those sticky bras, but in certain lighting, you could see the outline of it (something I kept trying to adjust).","In all though, it was a huge success and very comfortable."
"formal affair","I was worried about the cut and how to wear a bra with it...but was shocked that I didnt even need one with the boning.","Im obsessed with this dress.","Dying to buy it and just rented it in blue for a wedding."
"formal affair","This dress is the perfect mix between sophisticated and sexy.","While it doesnt show a lot of skin, it hugs every curve.","Like with all Elizabeth and James dresses, it runs small, so I sized up two sizes and it fit perfectly."
"formal affair","Ran a little large, Im usually between a 4 and a 6, but more of a 6 and the 4 fit perfectly.","Like other reviewers said, this dress is very long.","Im 56 and even with 4 inch heels, the dress was too long.","I wouldnt suggest ordering the long unless you are over 59 and planning on wearing very high heels.","I will definitely use rent the runway again, everything was so convenient and the dress was gorgeous!"
"formal affair","Flattering, gorgeous dress.","fine quality.","beautiful color.","The bare back is a game changer and quite a contrast with the apparently conservative front.","I went bra-less as others have said and it was fine.","Im 34D.","I wore the 8R.","Tips: clasp the collar before you zip the skirt!","this gives you more access to the collar clasps.","Not so good for dancing due to close fit.","Note to RTR: the 10R bottom clasp on the collar is missing!"
"formal affair","This was the first time I got to chaperone prom and was pretty unsure about what to wear.","This was actually a random back up when the original dress I got was out of my size...and it was so perfect!","Down to the color purple (which is our school color).","It was the perfect length and I got so many compliments.","I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"formal affair","I got so many compliments!"
"formal affair","There is no give to the dress, so make sure it fits well before you decide to wear it."
"formal affair","I thought it was true to size, but a little short.","Im 5.10 and I couldnt wear my normal high heels with the dress, I had to wear fairly low heeled shoes.","There was a little rip in the underskirt, but I only noticed because my heel got caught in it.","All in all, I loved the dress."
"formal affair","I really liked the dress overall...great fit, beautiful color and shape.","The one downside is that the 8L wasnt quite long enough.","Im 6 tall and it barely hit the floor in flats.","I ended up wearing it with low heels, but that brought down the elegancy of the look."
"formal affair","This was my first time ordering a dress offline, and I was very paranoid.","I wore this dress for senior prom.","It was a last minute decision due to the fact that I was not going to attend prom.","However, a week before my prom I decided that I wasnt going to waste money on an expensive dress for one night.","With only two days left until my prom, it came on time.","I wanted a 4L but they only had a 4R.","I ordered both the 4R and 6L with fears that the 4R would be too short ( I;m 57) and the 6L would be too big.","Lucky for me the 6L was perfect.","I spent hours looking at photos even after I ordered the dress.","I even called customer service with fears that it would not arrive on time.","Overall, the dress was PERFECT.","I was sad that I had to send it back.","In fact, I wouldve paid for this dress.","I really did feel glamorous.","This dress made my night.","I really appreciate RTR.","Theyre GREAT!"
"formal affair","Very form fitting"
"formal affair","The fabric was soft and complemented my husbands tuxedo.","I am 61 and felt like the style was age appropriate.","The dress was easy to dance in with the small train in the back.","I received many comments and I mentioned that it selected it from RTR.","You will be getting more customers."
"formal affair","The dress absolutely made my night.","The fabric and quality allowed for me to eat everything in sight and not be concerned because it really sucks everything in.","The just-above-the-knee cut made it classy but edgy due to the fit.","Make sure to wear a small cupped bra because mine stuck out a little.","Overall- GREAT first rental and I am looking forward to the next!"
"formal affair","The fit was a bit snug up top, especially if you have a larger chest size so I didnt wear a bra, but otherwise it was perfect.","It clings to the body, but doesnt look painted on.","It creates the most beautiful silhouettes for photos too.","Definitely recommend for any formal event."
"formal affair","i absolutely loved wearing this dress for one of my best friends weddings.","we all got so many compliments on the dresses and they were the perfect look for a formal winter wedding.","the dress fit true to size, but was a little short if wearing tall heels.","I am 5 7 and could only wear 2-3 inch heels (which ended up being more comfortable anyway :)).","I wore sticky boobs for a bra since its backless.","I dont think I wouldve been comfortable going bra-less."
"formal affair","I chose this dress after the one I originally rented didnt work out.","This dress ended up working out great.","The design in the front is simple enough to remain elegant, while still showing feminity.","I love that the bottom flares out, it made it very comfortable.","And the open back was goregous.","The only downside was photos couldnt capture how pretty the dress really was.","Overall, still loved it!"
"formal affair","I went back and forth about this dress because of the sequins; but I kept coming back to it because of the look.","I am glad I went with my gut.","Not only was it comfy but it was flattering.","I received so many wonderful compliments.","This dress hugs but it was not tight.","There is a bit of weight to the dress, but its not heavy or uncomfortable.","The dress was true to size, as I am a normal size 8.","I am glad I went with the L size because the R showed too much shoe.","I wore 4 inch heels with the L length, so if you stick to an average height heel, you might sweep the ground a little more.","My only issue was the tight armholes.","It wasnt uncomfortable but they were a little snug for my taste and restricted movement to a point..","If you want a dress thats going to be comfortable and turn heads, look no further."
"formal affair","The dress does run large, and I appreciate the other reviews that suggested ordering the second dress a size smaller, as thats the one I wore.","The dress is surprisingly comfortable, with the bonus of a normal bra working with it .","Assistance is required with the zipper - its sticky getting it past the seam, and you need somebody whos not afraid to give a good tug.","Definitely recommend this dress for a cocktail attire type event!"
"formal affair","This dress was beautiful and fit perfectly.","Hit right at the knee for 52 girl.","I chose the different dress, because the event was a little more formal than what this dress looked like in person - but I think Ill be renting this again for an upcoming wedding and wearing it!"
"formal affair","Fit perfect.",".probably could have done a 10.","Could have worn a strapless bra - but felt comfortable w/ the boning (which is unusual for me because I go NO where without a bra).","I was a nominee and while waiting to get up on stage 3 women commented on my dress (and there were some showstoppers there).","Went to event w/ 8 other women and they were all floored - 3 of them have already booked dresses for upcoming weddings and galas.","Theres always a little fear taking a chance on an online order - and I had never done anything Ike this before - but Everything was easy.","I actually ordered my original choice  so late on wed night that it wasnt going to make it to me before I left for LA - so RTR  shipped me this dress and another FREE to my hotel.","Could not have been happier with the dress and the service recovery!"
"formal affair","It had some stretch in it which was key.","Lace wasnt itchy.","the only thing that was annoying is that there is a purple tag that pulls up and minimizes the deep v in a weird way?","I couldnt keep it down.","Ironing it might help?"
"formal affair","This dress is a classic elegant look perfect for a work event or wedding.","The dress fit very well in the hips was a bit big in the top.","Cap sleeves are roomy, comfortable and stay in place.","Fabric was lace with no stretch but fit well.","Dress would look great with statement earrings no necklace required!","At 58 this dress hit at my knee.","As for my measurements; 17 from shoulder to shoulder, 17 from shoulder to waist, 25 from waist to knee, 17 from hip to knee."
"formal affair","Pros: fit beautifully, loved the side pockets.","I had somewhere to put my hands and lipstick.","I used tape to keep the top from moving and showing my goods, and I loved how it wrapped around without any bulkiness.","Highly recommend this dress."
"formal affair","Loved this dress.","It is gorgeous and fits very well.","I think it is very flattering on curves and works well on pear/hourglass shapes."
"formal affair","The color was gorgeous.","The zipper was very difficult, not because it was too tight but it kept getting stuck on the fabric.","Beautiful dress though.","It was fine for short people.","I thought maybe it would be too long but it was okay.","I am short and thick and felt pretty in it."
"formal affair","The fit was nice, I wish it had elongated my short torso more!","The zipper is probably the worst thing ever.","I cant believe how cheap the zipper quality was for such an expensive dress....","Plenty of room for my boobs which can sometimes be a size issue for me!","Overall I liked it!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress!","The fabric was gorgeous and luxurious...and comfortable too.","I loved the conservative fit mixed with the eye-catching fabric...really classy."
"formal affair","Fit my hourglass figure like a glove!","I am 59, 135 lbs and a 32C.","I wore 4 inch heels and the size 2L was perfect!","The dress still swept the floor so be careful not to order the L sizes if youre on the shorter side.","I have a small waist and bigger hips and the dress was stretchy enough to accommodate for my fuller hips and butt.","Very comfortable to dance in.","Felt like a million bucks and got tons of compliments.","Definitely recommend!","Also, RTR has the best customer service!"
"formal affair","This dress was stunning!","The fit was perfect and the ruffle hides any little pooch you might have!","I received so many compliments.","The material is a little thicker which made it fairly toasty for a summer black tie wedding but all-in-all a 9/10 dress !"
"formal affair","The arm holes a little tight- I probably could have used a 4 instead of the 2- Tail is a bit od a pain, but worth the impact."
"formal affair","the fit was like a glove.","i ordered a 2 and 4, i was hoping to squeeze into the 2, i actually may have but i stuck with the 4 because it was fairly comfortable.","im short, about 51 so i was worried about the length but with heels on it was the perfect length.","the dress hugged all the right parts.","i was heartbroken to send the dress back!"
"formal affair","Beautiful dress, luxurious material - definitely makes you feel like youre on a runway.","If you like mermaid dresses, you will LOVE this gown!","Short story - Im the wrong body type for this style, and I received this as a substitution dress.","Though it definitely was not perfect for me, if you are considering it and you have any body type other than apple, it is likely perfect for you!","Warning: it definitely runs SHORT.","I am 53 and the 10R allowed the tops of my feet to show.","Since this was a substitute, I decided to try it despite my fears of a mermaid-style dress, it wasnt as terrible as I expected - in fact, it appeared to cinch the waist I dont have!","Im sure its quite flattering on someone with any other body type.","Since it certainly wasnt ideal for me, RTR agreed to send me new substitutions (AMAZING customer service!).","However, I knew that if those were somehow worse than what I started with, this would do in a pinch."
"formal affair","I received so many compliments on this dress and it fit like a glove!!","Id recommend wearing normal size or even going down a size.","I got both the 0 and 2 and ended up wearing the 0 -- the 0 was a perfect fit and very flattering."
"formal affair","Great dress, perfect fit, phenomenal condition!"
"formal affair","Even though this dress is tight, the material is thick so its forgiving and very flattering.","The color is fantastic too!"
"formal affair","I am so glad I ordered a long (10L).","I am 57 and wore a 4 inch heel.","The front sash fell slightly awkward and created a small pouch look.","I may have been able to go with the size 8 for a tighter fit.","The slit is sexy and not too much.","I felt very sexy but ladylike in this gown.","The zipper wouldnt zip all the way down so luckily I could still squeeze in it."
"formal affair","Ran true to size.","Love the fabric!"
"formal affair","This dress was unbelievable!","It was the perfect look for my holiday party.","It gave a little bit of a stretch so it was not only comfy but great to dance in too!!","I highly recommend this look!"
"formal affair","I have never had so many people compliment me on my dress before at a formal event!","This dress is very body friendly for a larger bust and so comfortable!","Nude heels were the perfect shoes to go with this dress.","Lots of sparkle and fun!","RTR made everything so easy - Im very impressed with this company and will be renting every chance I get moving forward!","Thanks Rent The Runway!"
"formal affair","This wasnt my first, second, or third choice.","I discovered that young girls must of taken over this site for prom.","Im far past that age, but I also needed a sexy and long gown the same night.","This dress ended up doing the job.","It has zero give, so be prepared for sucking it in as it defines your waist.","I loved the sequins and the fit of the bust.","It had a Jessica Rabbit /Hollywood starlet vibe.","My only critique is that it left little cuts on my breasts and under my arms.","Those pretty shiny gems hurt!","Luckily, they were not noticeable until the next morning.","Mixed feelings on this pretty dress.","Luckily my ex thought I looked good, so I won in the end.",";)"
"formal affair","Im only 52 and the arms could be tighter.","Ill rent a 2 next time."
"formal affair","When I first got it, I struggled a little with the criss cross straps and the space for my head.","After all that, the dress fell on me perfectly--I didnt even need to try the size M. I like the appropriate thickness of the dress, as well as the curves it made for my hips while not showing any belly.","I appreciate the pockets as well, which I kept my phone in.","The length hit me right above the knees, and it didnt fly up intensely when the wind blew hard.","Well worth the price!"
"formal affair","The dress was stunning and really flattering once I put it on.","I have a smaller waist and a larger chest, and this dress hit at the smallest point of my torso, and I was able to wear a bra, which is a concern for me.","The cutout in the back and slit made the dress just sexy enough, and it was easy to move in.","Not nearly as heavy as you would expect.","I am a size 6 and 54, but after reading reviews I ordered a 6 Long.","It was the perfect length with 3 heels, but if youre taller than 54 and/or want to wear heels, definitely get the long.","Awesome awesome dress, and another woman at the event was wearing the exact same one, so its definitely popular!"
"formal affair","Its a tight fit and Im not gonna lie, my boobs were falling out all night, so fashion tape is 100% necessary ( I unfortunately did not have it).","But other than that I would definitely rent this again!"
"formal affair","I ordered a 4P based on the reviews that said the dress ran large.","I am currently a 6P.","The 4P fit like it was made for me.","Comfortable, easy to wear.","I put it on and never had to think about it again the rest of the night.","No tape, no hem, and only 2 inch heels.","At 53 I was concerned about the the length, but it was perfect.","Just skimmed the floor, but I could walk easily without tripping.","Fabulous.","Love the dress."
"formal affair","I got so many compliments on this dress.","I ordered the 12 and the 14, I would have preferred to wear the 14, but when it arrived the stitching on the back of the 14 was slightly damaged, so I wore the 12.","The 12 was fine because the dress has some stretch to it.","I was really concerned about what type of bra I was going to wear with the dress because of how the back was made, but it worked with a nude halter bra.","I felt like a true superstar in this number."
"formal affair","The only con was since im a 36ddd i had to size up to a 12R for some extra boob room, even though the 10R fit my body better."
"formal affair","Its got pockets and they come in handy.","I like to bling effect on the top and the bottom compliments my body type so well.","Its got the runway effect and yet not too much.","I got complimented so many times at a three-hour event.","Just to nick-pick, the bottom of the skirt was a little wrinkly when it arrived though."
"formal affair","The pros were how sleek I looked in my dress.","I got so many compliments and it looked stunning.","The slit was perfect and the length was just right for my stilettos.","The first dress I got was a little big and that was the 4p, plus there was a small tear.","Thank God for that second free dress.","You cannot go wrong in this dress and the material felt good on my skin.","The only thing was that the sleeves were kind of tight on my arms."
"formal affair","I had been eyeing this dress for awhile and had the chance to wear it to a formal rehearsal dinner for a good friend.","The dress is appropriately sexy and very flattering at the waist.","I loved the tulle skirt and it was very easy to move in.","The lace detailing at the top is beautiful and I received complements all night!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress for a formal awards banquet and it was perfect!","The dress has amazing flow and bounce when you walk.","I felt stylish all night!"
"formal affair","I wear a 14 and this was true to size.","Im 57 and it was not too long.","I recently had a baby and it was nice and forgiving in the waistline."
"formal affair","True to size.","Very low back, so its good that its form fitting and doesnt require a bra.","Completely comfortable.","I got just a ton of attention and compliments and felt like an Oscar nominee for sure.","Really dont have a bad thing to say about this dress, but do want to say that the color of the dress and the color of the photo on the site are not the same.","The dress is more of a pinkish, coppery gold, and to me the photo on the site looks like more of a neutral-to-traditional gold.","This really impacts the jewelry you choose, so keep this in mind.","The earrings that RTR suggested had traditional gold color and didnt match well at all, and I didnt wear them."
"formal affair","I loved wearing this.","Didnt need a bra even though Im well endowed in the breast area.","Fit was great!","It was a little long, so if you are short you may have to wear heels.","Im 56 and I was able to wear flats with it with minimal dragging."
"formal affair","High quality, beautiful dress.","Vibrant blue with beautiful mesh detail.","Was complimented all night!"
"formal affair","The dress was cut a little low in the back to hide my bra.","It was be nice to have a hook on the dress that could be attached to that portion of the bra."
"formal affair","The dress fit perfect.","The pockets were great and the length was appropriate for a work party."
"formal affair","I wore this to a rehearsal dinner for one of my close friends.","I received several compliments on this dress if I would have had the option to buy it I would have....."
"formal affair","This dress had a lot of room to move around in.","The bust area had a lot more room than I needed, so I looked pretty big up top.","It wasnt my first choice for a dress, but was the only one that fit properly, so I went with it."
"formal affair","I didnt wear a bra because it would have been too tight (32DDD) but I could have because the dress covers the band.","The dress is tight in ALL the right places and I love the flattering neck line."
"formal affair","Low cut!","I do not usually have much cleavage, but this dress provided plenty of cleavage.","The fabric was perfect - hugged nicely at the top through the waist and then flared out around the hips.","The length was a tad bit long for me, but it did not stop me from wearing it."
"formal affair","I ordered the medium and the large from the reviews I read.","The medium fit but the lace neckline was a little tight and the large just felt better.","The zipper was a little funky, not sure if the lace or being used multiple times has caused that.","I would rent this again.","Perfect dress for the theater!"
"formal affair","This dress is gorgeous and very classy.","Its beautiful and i recommend it to anyone going to a ball/prom."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for my fiances annual work formal.","I was excited for this dress but ended up not wearing it due to some construction issues.","Pros: color!","; overall shape -the bell sleeves are very on trend; great length.","Cons:  the one very big con is that the front top of the dress constantly rolls down, not falls down but rolls down, and this messes with the whole shape and look of the dress.","This is a fitted dress so the bottom layer is tight and rides up.","The top layer is not connected to the bottom and does not ride up in the same way; it falls more normally.","These 2 factors cause the top layer to keep moving down while the bottom layer moves up, creating that rolled down issue at the neckline.","Overall, this dress is great in theory but the execution is poor.","I am sad to say that I would not recommend this dress."
"formal affair","I rented this dress and another for backup for a formal event.","The color is much more vibrant in person, a gorgeous, emerald green.","It is very well-made, the lace is very intricate, and there is great scallop detailing.","I ordered both a 0 and a 2.","I never wear size zeroes, but the site said to order a size down for backup.","I put on the 0 first, and it fit perfectly in the bust and waist.","However, I have full hips so the complete lack of stretch in the material pulled the hip area, making it ride up when I walked.","I put the 2 on, with it fitting great in the bust but the waist was not fitted anymore.","Even though there was boning for extra shape, it was not enough.","I wish the dress had fit better, because the color and style were absolutely beautiful.","The dress would best fit someone with a fuller bust and smaller hips or more of a straight figure - people with more of a pear shape like myself will have a hard time with this one."
"formal affair","I wore this to a formal event that required black or red dresses.","I am 53 and wore 2 inch heels, probably should have worn 2.5inch shoes.","The only qualm I have with the dress is that I am practically flat chested and there werent that many options to choose from that would be suitable for my height without wearing 5 inch feel, so I spent the evening pulling the dress up."
"formal affair","This dress fits like a glove!","It was comfortable and beautiful.","Be careful when choosing a bra though - a backless, sticky bra should do the trick.","The cutouts prevent you from wearing Spanx or a bra w/ straps."
"formal affair","Be cautious with cleavage if you have decent sized breasts.","Midsection was tight forcing you to sit up straight, not necessarily a bad thing.","High-low offered good breathability, and the color was phenomenal.","I would love to rent this again in a heartbeat, just maybe not for a wedding....","I wore the 6R (they didn’t have long available) instead of the 8L just so i had a little breast support without a bra and a little more hug.","The 8 would have been perfect if you are looking for a more comfortable (Breathable) fit."
"formal affair","Loved this dress to pieces but it run big.","The waist had a lot of room and probably made me look bigger than I actually am.","I had to pin the bust together so my ladies werent the center of attention, since Im a DD.","I ordered the 12L and Im really happy I did because I also ordered a 12R in the gold strapless version of this dress and it was way too short.","The long was super long though and I had a platform shoe on so I had to slightly pick it up through out the night.","It photographs a slightly different color than it actually is.","Over all Im extremely happy with the dress and would recommend it to anyone."
"formal affair","This dress was definitely fitted and more of a purple than it appears in this photo.","It was a smashing success at the benefit gala I attended."
"formal affair"," I didnt end up wearing this.","I usually wear a 4, but even the 6 was a little too tight.","I have a larger ribcage, and it was tight in that area and a little too tight in the belly area for my taste.","I think this would work best on someone with a small-to-medium ribcage and a totally flat belly."
"formal affair","As comfortable as a t-shirt!","Fits perfectly if you like a short dress.","Totally appropriate for a formal affair or a cocktail party."
"formal affair","The dress fit true to size."
"formal affair","The dress was absolutely amazing!","My heels were about 3 inches, so the 4L hit just right.","I could have gotten away with ordering a 2L, but I ordered the 4L because I was nervous about it fitting (I wear a 2 or 4 depending on the style)!","It was definitely true-to-size and is loose over your hips so you have a little wiggle room.","It was absolutely stunning when I would walk because the dress flows all around your legs and looks amazing.","I got so many compliments!","Very comfortable and worked out perfectly.","The only con- I am not used to wearing formal gowns very often, so it took a little getting used to.","There are quite a few layers on the bottom, so if you lift your dress to go up stairs, make sure you get all of the layers!"
"formal affair","Beautiful dress!!","Super comfortable but definitely runs big.","I usually wear a 6/8 and the 6 was WAY too big.","So glad I listened to other reviewers and sized way down.","The 4 ended up fitting perfectly!","The material is pretty thick so it may be too warm on a hot summer day.","But it was perfect for my May bridal shower!"
"formal affair","Really gorgeous dress!","Feels great on.","Not TOO much cleavage.","Not terribly forgiving of eating a full meal but okay if you take your photos before dinner ;)"
"formal affair","I wore this for a Baptism and it was just right for that type of affair.","It is sophisticated and sweet although shows enough cleavage to avoid being overly conservative!","Pretty dress!"
"formal affair","The length was great with 3” heels."
"formal affair","This dress was very comfortable, not too low cut so I was able yo wear it for a formal work function.","Stands out in a crowd."
"formal affair","Loved dress, going try and rent it again.","Was not true to size.","There was no stretch at all in this dress."
"formal affair","I loved wearing this dress.","The fit was great...it was very flattering and concealed the things I didnt want to emphasize (tummy area) while highlighting the things I did (legs, bust).","It was comfortable...the fabric under the sequins is very stretchy and soft.","The color is gorgeous and unique.","I got tons of compliments all night and I hate to have to send it back!"
"formal affair","This dress is extremely comfortable and fit like a glove.","Wore it all night long with no issues.","I did use the double sided tape that was provided -- I have a smaller bust so it helped to keep everything covered."
"formal affair","This dress is very well made and the sleeves are so beautiful.","However, I ended up not wearing this dress because it was not flattering.","I have slightly broad shoulders and I usually go for dresses that have more of a decollete to balance it.","I thought it would give this dress a try, but it looked quite bulky.","If this is your problem area I would not recommend this dress."
"formal affair","The fit was perfect I wore 3 heels with this dress and the length was perfect, I wasnt tripping over it all night.","It fit perfect on top, though the zipper is a pain to zip up.","Dancing around all night was so much fun and easy.","I was really sad to have to return it :( Great first experience renting with RTR.","The stylist were so helpful when I was trying to decide what sizes to rent and they really put me at ease."
"formal affair","I got so many compliments on this dress!","Renting formal dresses can be an issue for short girls like myself (Im ~51) so I was happy to find one that was formal enough for black tie in a knee length style (or tea length in my case).","The open back was stunning and sexy but the overall style was conservative enough for a corporate gala.","My only issue was that the lining of the dress seemed longer than the sleeves and hung out a bit when I first put it on.","No big deal though because I carefully tucked the lining in when I was putting the sleeves on and it wasnt an issue.","I am usually an 8 but I ordered a size 10 and 12 because I knew I didnt want a tight fit.","If I wanted a really body hugging fit, I probably could have fit an 8 but I prefer a looser fit.","Overall a great classic look for a formal affair."
"formal affair","The dress is made very well.","Im usually a 6 or 8, but the 6 was actually a tad big in certain areas.","I am pretty tall as well, and it was longer than most dresses usually are on me.","People kept tripping on the small train."
"formal affair","The dress is beautiful.","However, it didnt fit my height well.","The waistline was at least 4 inches above my natural waist and made the fit look awkward.","I am hourglass shaped, and with the high-waist, I ended up in an 8 instead of my normal size 6.","The dress is definitely gorgeous though, and if the fit would have been better, I would have given it 5 stars!"
"formal affair","I wore the 14 even though the 12 also zipped and fit.","My 38D chest seemed like it fit better in the 14 and fell more where the natural bust-line was supposed to be.","Women with large large busts should size up.","I loved that it showed off some cleavage while still feeling covered up with the lace.","I was able to wear a normal black bra.","Be careful when you stand up, as the under-tulle skirt may need to be laid flat.","The skirt is poofy.","I am 58 so this fell just above the knee.","I loved how it hid my tummy since the waist sits very flatteringly above it.","The zipper is a bit sticky."
"formal affair","Body hugging in all the right ways, very figure flattering.","The pictures on the site dont do this dress justice.","I went with the long and was able to wear 3 heels.","If you have a fuller chest just be aware as it is low cut.","The only down side for me was the straps kept falling while dancing.","But that is likely because I have a very short torso.","I would certainly rent this again!"
"formal affair","Do not rent if you are tall.","Everywhere else fit but the torso wasnt long enough.","Length was great just dont rend if you have a long torso!","I ended up not being able to use it."
"formal affair","The dress is absolutely beautiful and fit like a dream.","Im glad I ordered the long because it was too short for the 3.5 inch heels I planned on wearing and had to switch shoes at the last minute."
"formal affair","This is a beautiful dress.","I am 56 and this dress was a little to long, even with very high heels.","I had to hold it up when I walked.","This dress is very flattering and the color is right on with the picture."
"formal affair","the length was perfect for me.","i am 55 and i didnt wear heels in any of the pictures but i was wearing 4 heels for the night.","i am a 36DD and the top fit perfectly for me.","it was so stunning and it got so many compliments.","the only con i can think of is how itchy the under arms were.","however, i didnt experience any chaffing.","i would definitely recommend this dress!"
"formal affair","I typically wear a 4 or a 6.","I went with the 6 on this one as it was fitted around the ribcage.","The dress is wonderful."
"formal affair","The straps sit nicely off the shoulder and the flexible plastic sewn inside helps keep them in place without falling.","The fabric is pretty lightweight which keeps the peplum from looking too extreme.","I loved how the front crosses over, while the fitted waist gives the top a nice structure.","The zipper is incredibly hard to zip up on your own so make sure you have someone to help dress you!","The size fit perfectly though and I received so many compliments."
"formal affair","Im pretty short so it was slightly long but I wore 5-6in heels and it was fine.","It fit very well, the cinched waist is flattering, and comfortable and theres room to fit a strapless bra if desired.","The color was really bright and pretty as well.","I had ordered this as a backup dress for an Oscars party but ended up liking it much more once I put it on.."
"formal affair","This was a beautiful dress for a wedding rehearsal dinner.","The color pops, and the lace is delicately sophisticated!","The only issue is that the dress is a little boxy.","I added a brown belt to add some curves."
"formal affair","This was my first time using RTR.","So I made sure to read over everyones comments before selecting this dress.","I ordered a size smaller, as people suggested and it fit great!","You do show a lot of cleavage, however, and I could see were previous wearers had sown it up a bit higher.","I thought the dress looked best with an old Hollywood glamour look, so I paired the dress with gold heels and purse (from DSW) and antique looking jewelry (from Macys).","I was serving as a judge at the 2014 Ms.","Veteran America competition, so the crew completed my Hollywood glamour look (e.g.","hair/make-up).","I received numerous complements all evening and felt like a 50s bombshell movie star :) I would definitely order again."
"formal affair","I am a true to size 8, and this was almost too small, but once it was zipped and on, it was perfect.","Past reviews were correct when saying the zipper is hard to pull up past the waistband.","Youll definitely need help zipping this one up!","The length was perfect to wear with 3 inch heels, it just grazed the ground without me feeling like I was going to trip.","I got a ton of compliments, and I definitely will rent this again!"
"formal affair","The length of this dress was perfect for me, being 56, it hit right at my feet so I could wear flats but my shoes were still covered.","I had to hold the dress up to walk up/down stairs, but otherwise it wasnt long at all and I was comfortable all night in flats!","I received many compliments on this dress due to the unique cutout in the front, I wore fashion tape just in case but I didnt feel like I was going to fall out of this dress, the coverage was sufficient."
"formal affair","Fits well, zipper , seams and fabric all well made and comfortable.","My favorite thing about the dress ... loved the POCKETS!"
"formal affair","The deep purple is perfect for any formal occasion but the cut outs make it fun.","I wore this to my law school prom and it was one of the prettiest dresses there!","This dress is true to size and very comfortable/flattering.","Plus what girl doesnt like pockets?","10/10"
"formal affair","I like a high heel (Im talking add a little platform) and Im 54.","In retrospect I would have gone with a long but the regular was just fine."
"formal affair","Fits true to size - I was worried about the bust, but it is tight enough that you dont spend the evening adjusting it.","Gorgeous heavy fabric that was perfect for a winter gala with a color outside the lines theme."
"formal affair","You need to be very comfortable with having all your curves on display when you wear this dress.","I pared it with spanks and a lot of fashion tape to keep my boobs secure.","Had I tried this dress on at a store prior to the rental I would have never chosen it for this occasion.","It is VERY va-va-voom if you have sizable breasts.","This dress is made well and was on the heavy side which was good.","If you are going for sexy bombshell instead of classy lady this is the dress."
"formal affair","The size14 was unavailable and the armholes on the 16 were large.","Fixed with fabric tape.","The jeweled neckline on this dress is so flattering.","I did not belt it as it seemed to be designed to flow as you walk.","I paired it with RTR Kenneth Lane clip earrings.","Perfect!"
"formal affair","Fit like a glove.","Cutouts great detail!","!"
"formal affair","Great fit.","No complaints.","Cant really wear a bra with it, but is okay because the material is thick enough.","Better for petite and smaller busted girls."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a black tie charity event and it was perfect for the Cuban theme.","The ruffle adds that extra something and the cutouts in the bodice are more subtle than they appear on the website.","I am only 51 at best so the hem was a bit lower than it is intended, but it made the dress seem more formal than a knee length would.","There was a bit of a lump where the zipper ended at my hip, so watch out for that.","I wore a 0, which is my standard size, and had plenty of wiggle room.","I got tons of compliments on it, so if you are looking for a LBD thats just a bit different, go for it!"
"formal affair","I have never heard the word stunning more in my life.","I received so many compliments.","This was my back up to my back up dress.","R2R emailed me explaining the back up had come back damaged but they would expedite a new dress by 12:00pm that day and it worked out.","I am so impressed by their speedy customer service."
"formal affair","The dress drapes beautifully.","It is very comfortable and easy to wear.","Although form fitting, the draping in the front makes this dress wearable without spanx or any other horrible undergarments.","I got many compliments on it and am glad I rented it!"
"formal affair","This dress fits like a glove- I usually wear a 6R with an 8R as backup, but after reading other reviews I ordered an 8R w/10R as backup...","I ended up wearing the 8R and it was perfect.","Seriously, from the second I zipped this up I felt like a movie star.","Im bottom heavy with a small chest, so some dresses just dont work... but this one looked and felt amazing.","I wore it to a formal military event, and it was perfect- sexy but not over the top, formal but still fun.","It made me feel like a million bucks- I got a ton of compliments.","I would highly recommend this!","!"
"formal affair","Rented this for a Black Tie affair and got so many compliments.","Its stretchy so fist an hourglass shape.","Would definitely rent again."
"formal affair","Im 53 with a 32B so I usually wear a size 2 in dresses, and the reviews said it was long so I ordered the 2P and 4P and ended up wearing the 2P!","It fit perfectly with the 4 heels I wore and was about a centimeter or two off the ground with the heels.","It comes in other colors too, so I would definitely wear this one again!","The shipping was also very fast and got there a day earlier than planned!"
"formal affair","The dress is more burgundy or wine colored than red.","This is my first RTW purchase and I am thrilled!","Pros: photographs well, true to size, flattering neck/off shoulders, any bra will fit/hide well, and is a show-stopperCons: fits snug and is not forgiving, but can be flattering with the appropriate undergarments.","Noteworthy: long dress (must wear at least 6 inch heels if you are short - I am 53), and must wear full push up bra if your small chested, and had to do a lot of  yoga prior to this event to fit into this dress."
"formal affair","This was the perfect dress for the gala I attended.","Everyone raved about this dress.","Fit like a glove.",":)"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to my firm Christmas party in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium here in Atlanta, GA and it couldnt have been more perfect!","Everyone loved it, it was comfortable and I rented it at a steal.",";) I would recommend definitely rent this dress again and recommend it!"
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a black tie fundraising event.","This dress fit perfectly.","The fabric was thicker and the design hid any flaw.","I loved that it had a clasp on the side under the boobs to keep the dress tight before zipping.","Im 5ft 4in and wore a very small heel with no platform, and it touched the floor perfectly.","I didnt wear a bra, and certainly did not feel that one was needed.","The only issues were that it was warm on my legs due to the thick fabric.","Also, a small piece of ribbing (which is plastic) had broken through and I did have to go into the bathroom and unzip and unclasp to rearrange this piece of plastic that was stabbing me.","Overall, I loved this dress, and received lots of compliments.","This was my second time renting from RTR, and it was again an awesome experience."
"formal affair","The material was weird, but it was good because it didnt tug or show bra lines or anything.","Snug fit without being too short or too tight.","10/10"
"formal affair","This gown was all class!!","I LOVE this gown.","The sequined shoulders were my favorite part.","It did run a bit small, and would highly recommend sizing up.","(Fit equally small through the bust, hips, and waist) Although it did run small, the fabric has a ton of stretch.","The gown was super comfortable, and a regular bra could be worn.","Spanx might work best just to hide any panty lines.","The gown was shorter than anticipated, and was a bit too short for my personal preference.","This would be ideal for women 57 or under!"
"formal affair","Wore to my nieces sweet sixteen.","Fit like a glove.","It hit just above the knee (Im 53) which was great because being that it was tight it made it look classy.","(I never want tight AND short)"
"formal affair","This was my first time using RTR and I loved it!","I ordered the 8R and was very glad they offered the free backup size because I ended up wearing the backup.","The zipper on this dress can be tough to zip by yourself due to the center band of fabric.","The larger size was more comfortable to wear in the chest.","The length was perfect for me in heels, just skimmed the ground as I walked.","I got so many compliments on the dress at a holiday party.","I will definitely be renting again!"
"formal affair","This dress was perfect for a black-tie affair.","I wore it in mid-September to a formal wedding in Houston, TX and the effect was incredible.","I found the gown to be a bit more of a marigold color, although with good light it does look more like a sunshine yellow.","The fit was good, not perfect, but I did not find myself pulling up and readjusting all night long like I was nervous about.","You can tell up close that the dress had been well enjoyed and worn to several occasions due to a bit of fraying on the bust and midsection, but the little fuzzies did not deter the overall look and feel of the dress.","I felt beyond special at someone elses wedding (which I feel minorly guilty about) so I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking about it, as long as you dont mind the attention!"
"formal affair","Dress fit like a glove and was so comfortable!","Many, many compliments ...","I didnt want to send it back!"
"formal affair","I should have heeded the warnings of previous reviewers regarding the lining popping up at the chest.","It happened all night long.","I tried double sided tape in various placements but it did not work!","Other than that ..beautiful dress!","Unfortunately my pics are too big to upload!"
"formal affair","Proportionally, the top was a little off on where it needed to hit my waist line, but that is typical for any dress with my frame.","Length was good, hit right at the top of my shoes - I wore flats.","Very comfortable dress."
"formal affair","This dress is magic.","Amazing.","COMFORTABLE.","There arent enough positive adjectives.","Its so different and elegant with the turtle neck type neck line.","The material is thick and great quality.","I wore this to a Black Tie Winter Gala so probably not the best for a summer event.","It has a discreet but sexy slit in the front with almost a wrap dress style.","It comes with a great sash to tie around your waist and show your curves!","I had to use fashion tape to keep my strapless bra from showing underneath my armpits but that 2 second annoyance didnt change my opinion on the dress AT ALL.","I received SO many compliments and was truly sad to return it.","I would absolutely rent this again."
"formal affair","Fit was perfect and color was amazing.","It was my back-up dress.","Very different than the dress I intended to wear which I also loved.","However, my husband and friends (posted both on social media because I couldnt decide) overwhelmingly chose this one for me.","A little snafu with delivery.","Did not arrive on Thursday night as ordered.","Shipped another order to me which arrived on Saturday at noon.","Cut it very close for a Saturday night event."
"formal affair","Its a comfortable dress once you get the fit correct.","Im normally a 6, but the 8 fit with this dress.","You do need to wear a strapless with this due to the style of the back."
"formal affair","I ordered the regular lenght based on reviews.","Im 58 and wore 2 heels and the dress went just to the floor so you really could not see my shoes, maybe just a hint of my toes.","Im big boned up top, wide rib cage and the top fit perfectly.","I didnt have to wear a bra, but Im an A cup.","The zipper is a little tough so have patience!"
"formal affair","The dress was a  perfect fit.","The band was a little tight but not too tight.","I ordered a size up as back up in case it was too tight but no need.","It was my favorite yet!","The material on the lower was thick and smooth and the upper was not scratchy at all.","I loved it!"
"formal affair","The dress fits true to size and its the most comfortable formal dress I have ever worn.","The only annoyance was having to pull the front down a few times to avoid the slits from rising too high, but I was overall pleased with the dress!"
"formal affair","This dress runs true to size, as I am a size 0 but wore a size 2.","It is very roomy and extremely comfortable.","I love how loose and flowy this dress is.","Great for the summer!","A slip would be best for this dress, because the material is very light and sheer.","This dress hit me right below the knee."
"formal affair","This dress runs true to size, and is not fitted in the hips.","If you are wearing it with heels and are over 58 consider the tall size.","I wore the regular with flats and it was floor skimming.","Although I wore it in the fall when it was quite cold, Id imagine it is an acceptable weight for a summer or spring event, not too stuffy."
"formal affair","Ordered the 4P and 6P and ended up wearing the 6P.","I actually never tried on the 4 so not sure if it would have fit.","The 6 was very comfortable so I went with that one.","Wore with 3 inch heels and the length was perfect.","Wore to a black tie event fundraiser and  got a number of compliments on it.","The dress was torn at the end of the zipper, but I dont think you could tell once it was one.","I wore a regular bra with criss cross straps and it worked perfectly."
"formal affair","I wore this 6 months pregnant and worked great.","It was very comfortable, but spanx are a must.","It hugs every curve so its not super forgiving but the comfort made up for it.","I also loved the unexpected detail in the back!"
"formal affair","Loved, loved, loved this dress.","It was absolutely GORGEOUS.","Cleavage was just THERE even after trying to use fashion tape for a bit of modesty.","The dress is more of a rose-gold than anything but beautifully compliments any skin tone.","Negative: The zipper is horrible!!!","Even when the dress was off, it took both my husband and myself to zip up the dress.","When I put it on, my husband eventually had to use pliers to zip me into the dress.Additionally the dress is long.","I am 5 feet and wore a 2 with 3.5 inch heels and needed to lift it to walk.","I also have a small upper body and so the shoulder straps were a bit large and needed tape to be held down.","I also ended up switching my hair to an updo because my hair was constantly getting caught in the sequins and pulling."
"formal affair","IT WAS COMFORTABLE!","It has straps so I wasnt constantly trying to hold it up!","It was a dinner party and I could eat to my hearts content and still feel great in this dress!","I read that the dress ran large ( I usually wear a 4 or 6 and I am 59 so I made sure to order a 4 long and 4 short just to see but I ended up wearing the 4 long and it was perfect!"
"formal affair","This dress is beautiful and fits quite well.","I would say it runs a smidge large.","I ordered the Long size as I am tall and usually wear heels, but had to wear a platform WITH a 4 inch heel to be tall enough for this to not drag on the floor.","For those tall girls out there like me deciding what you want your back-up size to be, I would rent a long and a regular length gown should you not have heels tall enough to wear with this dress.","I also had to wear badding in the bust to fill it out a bit more and I have a pretty decent cup size.","Overall, I would definitely rent this dress again and hope that the next time I do, I can wear it longer!"
"formal affair","I ordered both the 18 and 20.","I wear normally wear a 16, checking the measurements on the Carmen Marc Valvo website, it looked like I would be an 18, but I was a bit worried about the bust.","(I wear a 40DD).","The bust on the 18 was really snug, but it fit nicely everywhere else.","The 20 felt a little big, but fit nicely in the bust.","The reviews are all right about the length, in my bare feet the front of the dress grazed the top of my feet, in heals, you could see my entire shoe.","I got compliments all night and felt really beautiful in this dress and I could wear a regular bra!"
"formal affair","Tight in the hips and very long - I had to wear heals and Im 510"
"formal affair","Narrow at the waist, length was perfect for my 52 frame, skirt has beautiful movement, material is sturdy, did not need a bra"
"formal affair","It fit like a glove, highlighting the curves in all the RIGHT places.","If you have an hour glass figure it will highlight you shape and if you dont ... it will create one.","I wore the dress for an awards ceremony where I was a nominee ...","I didnt win but I looked fabulous.","Great dress"
"formal affair","I rented this dress using unlimited membership and will keep it for Easter Sunday because it came brand new with tags.","Is is really pretty, good quality.","I think it is true to Kate Spade size or maybe a bit large.","If you are in between size I would go with the smaller size unless you have a larger chest.","I am 34 A and this fit comfortable everywhere."
"formal affair","Pros: backless, but fully supported in the front and rest of dress.","Its a elegant look.","Cons: the petite was not available and Im 54.5, the dress was a bit long and dragged even though I wore 2 inch heels.","The neck was a bit snug just like how others had reviewed."
"formal affair","I am 5ft 1in about 135lbs.","The dress Im in is a 4R.","I normally wear petite so it was slightly longer than I would have liked.","The dress I originally ordered was a 4P and was unavailable for shipping due to whatever reason.","This was my next choice out of the available options.","I couldnt have been more satisfied honestly.","This is a fabulous dress!"
"formal affair","Like the dress for the unique neckline straps- edgy but not revealing.","Very comfortable to wear all night with a good degree of stretch (comfortable but flattering/structured rather than clingy).","Ran a little large on me, and having extra room in the neckline straps is really obvious, I ended up sizing down."
"formal affair","I didnt know what length to order so I went with the regular and it was too short!","I was able to get the 4L within 20 hours or receiving the first dress!","I ended up wearing the 4L and it was a perfect fit.","The opening in the front was a little low but it was not a big deal at all and I was able to use fashion tape.","I wore lower heels and the dress still dragged the floor, but not too long to deal with.","I suggest if you are 57 or taller just go with the long!","Overall i enjoyed the dress and it was easy and hassle free for the debutant!","This company is great and I will for sure rent again!"
"formal affair","Everyone was telling me how beautiful my dress was.","I felt amazing in it as well .","It is very comfortable and you can ware your normal bra.","I am 58 and very glad i ordered the long because the regular was too short but the long was perfect with 3in heels.","I am so glad I am so glad i went with this dress and Rent the Runway was Great."
"formal affair","The dress is beautifully made and I received a number of compliments.","I will say, it does fit a bit small on the top.","I ended up wearing my size up backup to be more comfortable.","The lace around the collar and sleeves also doesnt lay the best.","I also felt like it is difficult to accessorize, and it kinda.","Needed a little something."
"formal affair","Youve heard other reviewers say the zipper is difficult - they are correct!","I followed others advice and put a bit of soap on the zipper and it was still iffy but finally got over the waist area.","I think that its a side zipper makes it all the more difficult from a twist around and try to do this perspective.","But, even with DH helping, it was tough.","Fabric is elegant and the details are wonderful.","The waist is fitted but does not dig in to create the appearance of a fat back.","Unfortunately, I was not able to wear the dress as the hem had come unstitched and flipped on the back side of the dress.","My timeline was too tight to attempt the stitching myself.","Glad I had another dress as a backup.","Im not used to the retro full skirt yet and not sure its the right look for me.","If you want to feel like Audrey Hepburn for the evening, this is a great dress :-)"
"formal affair","It had stretct, not too tight.","I wore a strapless bra with it since the back was a little low."
"formal affair","Fit very well.","I did not wear a bra with it, and it stayed up wonderfully without any tape.","I ordered the 10R and 10L.","The 10 L was WAYYY too long, so I wore the 10R with 3 inch heels, which made it just skim the floor.","I didnt have my dress stepped on once the entire evening!!","Only complaint--the zipper SUCKS.","I ran around my sorority house and had 8 different girls try to zip it up.","This wasnt because it was too small for me; we easily pulled the sides together.","The zipper was the problem, honestly!!","Beautiful dress though!","You can make it as elegant or as informal as youd like with accessories.","I paired it with a sparkly, chunky necklace from my personal jewelry box to wear to my sororitys formal."
"formal affair","Form fitting but lined enough that I did not wear a bra.","Ruched at the waist which hid imperfections."
"formal affair","I loved the length, the ease of getting it on, and the comfort!","I felt like the 14 was a little loose, but better than a little tight!"
"formal affair"," I really wanted this dress to work because I loved the neckline and feel of the bottom.","Awesome quality but the top was WAY too low cut.","I have a small chest and could barely keep it up.","The straps were also way to loose too and I am very broad shouldered.","It fit my waist but the top was too low cut and falling down.","I ended up not wearing it."
"formal affair","I was hoping for it to have a pizazz and be something special, that was not the case.","It was pretty boring.","I am petite and short and it bunched up in the back over my rear, not flattering.","If you have a long torso this might be flattering."
"formal affair","This is a gorgeous dress!.","However, if your have a tummy issue, this dress is not very forgiving and I suggest you size up if you are self-conscious about a tummy bulge.","I recommend you wear a strapless tummy control garment underneath to give it a more streamlined look.","I would definitely rent this dress again if I had another opportunity but I might go with a size bigger."
"formal affair","Very comfortable - fits well, great color - really stood out in a field of black but felt formal.","Its long - or rather, Im short 54 so wear high heels!","Loved it and got a ton of complements"
"formal affair","I rented this for a work party and felt very classy yet sexy.","I would say the only downside to this rental was that it is a bit difficult to get on and off.","There is no zipper so you have to pull it up over your whole body which can be tough without ripping the delicate shoulder areas.","I rented a backup size and it unfortunately came damaged (not surprising given how hard this is to take on and off).","But aside from that issue, once its on it looks GREAT!","the fabric is thick and stretchy and very flattering.","The color is darker than it looks online but very pretty.","Overall it makes you looks longer and leaner and I found the L length to be perfect for me (5 5) with 3 heels."
"formal affair","I think it fits true to size!","It held everything in.","I wore some spanx to help suck everything in.","If your spanx has undewear lining it will show so make sure you do not have those.","Was able to wear my own bra."
"formal affair","This dress is beautiful!!","My only con is that it was a little long.","I am 55 and wore 3 heels and it was still dragging on the ground."
"formal affair","The dress fit perfectly.","I also love that there was a built in bralette.","no need to worry about finding under garments to fit the dress.","It was a little hard to zip up but with extra hands, there were no issues.","I received tons of compliments!","The color looked great in sun light.","The only negative-- the fabric felt kind of cheap, but Im guessing that was from the floral like green lace as the top layer.","Still a gorgeous dress"
"formal affair","I was somewhere in the middle in sizing between a M and a L, and I had two events in different cities two days in a row, so I actually wore both sizes, one on each day.","I preferred the fit of the M over the L, particularly in dress length.","The crepe feature at the knee is what makes this simple dress pop.","The dress is stretchy and very forgiving.","The fabric is heavier than you might expect.","The sleeve on this dress is also very work-professional, as it hits mid-way between the shoulder and the elbow.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"formal affair","Im 54 so it was slightly long on me, but with really high heels it worked perfectly."
"formal affair","This dress has a nice hourglass shape, however, the 0P was still a little too large for my figure.","It was a little too loose in the belly, back, and bust.","A little long, recommend heels with it.","Looks nice in photos, the red really pops against a military uniform."
"formal affair","Lots of compliments, very comfortable to wear all night!","I loved the no zipper.","I wore Spanx which gave me a bit more confidence.","I also wore a regular black bra, no strapless needed.","I ordered and wore the long, and with my 3.5 heels it was perfect.","Highly recommend!"
"formal affair","Loved everything about this dress.","Runs true to size, length was perfect (I am 51, pear shaped, 34B bust, 128 lbs) and I danced all night long in it.","So many compliments and perfect for our company Cancun awards banquet.","I wore a strapless bra with it and had no problem with the top staying in place.","Would definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","The dress runs true to size (I wear a 4 unless hip cut is slim) and is very forgiving in the hip area.","The red color is stunning and the structure of the bottom holds its shape nicely.","I took the dress to Russia and wore it to dinner and a ballet.","It did not wrinkle and still looked great at the end of the evening.","Due to the notching at the armholes a strapless bra is required.","Dress is really beautiful and I received several compliments."
"formal affair","True to size.","Flattering on hourglass figure."
"formal affair","Dress fit like a glove plenty of room in bust are I am a 34DDD and it covered appropriately for the event while still a bit of sexy!"
"formal affair","I wore this to a gala and it was the perfect long black dress.","The 8 fit perfectly and the high neck is very flattering, but it was long, even will my 3 inch heels.","Highly recommend!","Ill be renting this dress again!"
"formal affair","This dress is STUNNING!","And to say it fits like a glove would be cliche.","It is a glove.","No spanx needed!"
"formal affair","This was my first time renting with RTW and I am officially hooked.","This was actually my backup dress for my fraternitys winter semiformal but after trying it on, I felt incredible.","As corny as it sounds, I have never had a dress make me feel so unbelievable confident, classy, and sexy!","I am watching this dress online to see if the price drops because I NEED to own it!","It can easily be dressed up with heels or worn casually to a dinner or date.","It felt a little tight but I didnt feel uncomfortable like I usually do with tight-fitting dresses.","It is a deep navy which doesnt really come up in the pictures.","The neckline complimented my boobs well and the belt helped hide my gut.","I got SO many compliments on it and I would definitely rent again!"
"formal affair","It fit perfectly except the zipper had a few problems but otherwise true to size."
"formal affair","Beautiful black dress that is simple and elegant in the front, and dramatic in the back.","Fits tight through the hips and has a subtle flare at the bottom.","Easy to walk and sit in, and also very comfortable."
"formal affair","This dress made me look slimmer, was very easy to dance in and I didnt have to worry about constantly readjusting anything.","I dont usually wear black but this dress was an exception!","My zipper was a little hard to pull up, not because it was tight, but because of something to do with the fabric.","I was able to zip it with a friends help.","I dont think you need a big chunky necklace to make this dress work."
"formal affair","I rented this for a black tie wedding at The Plaza.","This isnt the most impressive dress on the hanger, but it is a showstopper on the bod!","Hugs every curve in a very comfortable way as the fabric has stretch...","The low cut front is a bit revealing for a work function Id say,  but all about the styling.","Simple and classic, best worn with heels.","Id rent again in a second."
"formal affair","I rented this for an inaugural ball and loved it.","It was a little big up top, but nothing that some wardrobe tape couldnt take care of.","Length on the OR was perfect for me with 3 inch heels."
"formal affair","I wore it to a ball and the dress was perfect.","It was stretchy enough to be comfortable and not constricting.","The support bra that is a part of the dress provides enough support so I didnt have to wear a bra.","I got a lot of compliments on it.","I could have worn the 0R or the 2R but went with the 0R because it fit a *little* bit better."
"formal affair","The dress was amazing.","Heavier weight fabric was very flattering and forgiving.","A previous wearer had poorly stitched the next strap, once I removed the stitch it was easy to figure out.","The neck strap did end up to be too long so I pinned it in the back to shorten.","My hair covered the safety pins.","I did notice someone also stitched the side of that dress with dark green thread, word of caution to thoroughly inspect the dresses prior to wearing.","All in all, this dress was awesome and I felt glamorous and received many complements."
"formal affair","This dress runs true to size and the small fit exactly as I expected it would.","The mesh layer between the top and bottom help to make it fun while not feeling overly exposed.","Plus.","the mesh layer helps the dress hang the right way so rolls and bulges are not created from having a separate skirt.","Overall, I got a lot of compliments, was extremely comfortable all night, and had a blast wearing it.","Definitely recommend!"
"formal affair","Wish I couldve wore it, I ended up borrowing a dress from my friend that was a simple black dress.","THe fit was nice but the dress didnt ahve a WOW factor and that was what I was looking for."
"formal affair","The gown was exquisite.","I was VERY sad that I could not wear it as I ordered my size based on these reviews.","Is was VERY large in the waist.","I am not a tiny woman.","I shold have ordered a size 6, which I never fit in."
"formal affair","The fit was true to size.","The dress was actually heavier than I remembered."
"formal affair","LOVE LOVE this dress.","Such a beautiful color and the fit is perfect.","I ordered a 4 and 2 (I usually wear a 4) and I was more comfortable with the 2 only because I liked the top fitting so that I would not feel like the top was falling down all night!","I have never worn strapless so I was just not comfortable with that - but the dress fit too nicely to pass up - oh, and did I mention how gorgeous the color is?","I received compliment after compliment.","It truly is a stunning dress."
"formal affair","I wore this to a holiday party and loved it.","It was the perfect mix between elegant and sexy.","The dress fit true to size everywhere except in the shoulder area - it was a little big there and gapped oddly with some movements (there was dancing involved), it was not noticeable though.","The dress hit my upper thigh but was fitted all the way down so I didnt have to worry about it coming up too high.","I fell in love with this dress.","I would recommend it to anyone!"
"formal affair","Absolutely gorgeous dress; very classy and fit perfectly.","I would definitely recommend the Long size for taller girls.","I am 5;10 and it was the perfect length with 3 inch heels on underneath.","Would rent again in a heartbeat!"
"formal affair","Since I am pretty busty for my size, the stiffness of the material of this dress made the fit a little unflattering.","My chest made the stomach part stick out instead of the middle laying flat like it does on the model.","I know this dress would love fabulous on someone with a smaller chest."
"formal affair","The dress is beautiful and photographed really well.","I wore the smaller backup size, and it was still slightly large, so go down a size.","I have hips and it hugged my curves in all the right places.","The dress was comfy and I felt great in in the entire night!","I did feel like the chest was large on me and Im a 32 D, so watch out for that if you do not want to show off a lot of cleavage.","Overall a wonderful dress that I would rent again!"
"formal affair","I wore this dress to a charity gala.","It was stunning!","I received so many compliments.","The color was a beautiful red.","The fabric has a little bit of stretch to it so it was very comfortable.","I wore a strapless stick on bra, even though it probably wasnt necessary.","(I am a 34B).","The dress stayed up all night with minimal fussing.","The length of the 2L was perfect with my 3 inch heels.","(I am 56 and 124 lbs).","It barely touched the floor without tripping on it.","It was comfortable to dance in too.","The dress I was originally sent arrive stained so I called customer service and they overnight me another dress right away.","They were wonderful and easy to work with.","I will definitely be using RTR again!"
"formal affair","this dress is great for an hourglass shape!","you might have to buy a special bra for the back- it does go a little low but i used bra tape.","if you are 59 and taller- make sure to GET A LONG SIZE!","the dress did not touch the floor.","i highly recommend this dress-  make sure to order a size up of your usual size for the free second size!"
"formal affair","This dress was so comfortable and loose enough in the hips and waist to not need shape wear.","Theres good structure in the top, so even being a 34DD I didnt need a bra.","The sequins didnt bother me once the dress was on, but I did scratch my skin pretty bad taking it off the day before, so watch out for them.","Im about 57 and couldnt wear higher than 2 heels, even with the long inseam, but my heel caught on the train a fees over the night.","In short this dress was very comfortable and forgiving and the sequins give just the perfect touch of shine for a formal event."
"formal affair","Hourglass figure, 36 C, 30 waist, 40 hips, very forgiving and got tons of compliments.","Able to dance all night and not once did I re shimmy the bust."
"formal affair","I wore it to the rehearsal dinner for my brothers wedding and it was stunning."
"formal affair","Loved how the waist of the dress made my waist look small but it got a little uncomfortable because it was so right by the end of the night."
"formal affair","This was a backup dress since RTR couldnt send me the 2nd size of my original choice.","I didnt end up wearing it, but it was a beautiful dress.","The fit was lovely (really shows off your waist & falls nicely over the hips), except I felt it draped funny in the back.","It could be because Im shorter in the torso, but it gaped a little on the sides.","It would be a good dress to wear to a more formal, elegant affair."
"formal affair","Fit my body perfectly.","It is an absolute stunner.","Got a lot of compliments!"
"formal affair","The dress fit like a glove and was made from high quality fabric!","It wasnt too short or too long, the straps were just a tad loose and would fall down every so often!"
"formal affair","Its very low cut, which made me a little self conscious at a work event.","And I should have worn spanx to define a waist or something.","But the slit in the leg is much lower than the website pic shows and was great with my sparkly triple-strap shoes."
"formal affair","Size 2 fit perfectly.","I ordered a size 4 for backup because of other reviews that it runs small, but I didnt even try it on.","Only con would be the extra threads that were coming from the seams and cuts that run vertically on the dress.","The color is great."
"formal affair","Dress was great and comfortable.","It was looser than Id like below the bust, but that worked out fine.","The green is beautiful, though less bright than on the website.","Highly recommend the dress."
"formal affair","This dress was very comfortable and easy to move in.","I had to wear a NuBra, but I didnt even know I was wearing it.","I love the pockets as you can tell from the picture!","I would recommend this to anyone.","True to size, if anything it was a tiny bit roomy on top, but nothing noticeable."
"formal affair","Generally do wear a size 0 in dresses but the neckline / shoulder of the dress made it feel very claustrophobic in the size 0.","I ended up changing to the 2 at the last minute.","The dress doesnt have any give; very woven.","If hesitant, order your true size and 1 size up."
"formal affair","Fit was snug but true to size.","If you have very narrow shoulders like me, it was borderline uncomfortable in that regard.","Had to pull shoulders together several times.","Would wear again!","Felt glamorous, yet classy and the right amount of cleavage for a country club event."
"formal affair","Pros: beautiful fabric that looks great in person and in photos.","The dress was also super comfortable (except for it being big on top) and you can wear a regular bra with it.","Cons: it runs large around the shoulders and chest; I wish I could have gone down a size.","I had to belt it and use tape to make sure my bra didnt show.","Other than the sizing issue I was really happy with this dress!"
"formal affair","Since Im 51, this dress was a little longer than I wanted it to be, but Im used to that case being short.","It packed well since sequins dont wrinkle.","I rented the suggested earrings too which really pulled it together.","It had a deeper V in the front than expected, but I didnt feel too showy.","I got a lot of compliments and felt like it fit really well all over."
"formal affair","This gown is fabulous and glitzy!","We attended a Charity Gala with a Gatsby theme and this gown nailed exactly the look I was after!","would absolutely rent this again.","I carry a more petite frame at 56 however I carry a lot of muscle, which is why I decided to wear the 6R the night of the event.","I should have worn the 4R.","My back has quite a lot of muscle so the 4R was tight at first fit but now looking back I wish I had worn it.","As the night progressed (about and hour into the night) the dress started to grow or stretch and got way too big for me.","I was pulling it up at the chest the entire night and the stomach and hip areas got very large as well.","So I would say size down for your backup gown and wear that for the evening.","Now anyone at 56 or taller if you want to wear more than a 3 inch heel needs to order the long version!","I had the 6 and 4r which ended up being fine for me with the 3 inch heels but any higher of heel the gown would have been too short.","The zipper is nearly impossible to zip, you must be patient with it and have someone gently help you coax the zipper.","The sequins are also a little itch under the arms, but in truth you forget about them.","This gown is simply incredible!!!","I received so many compliments, too many to count."
"formal affair","I loved this dress.","Ultra modern cut and flattering fit.","It was exactly as I thought it would be.","No surprises."
"formal affair","My backup size zero fit perfectly, I thought I would be a size 2 but the dress is very lenient.","Even with size 0 I could have been a little curvier, and especially could have been bustier, and it still would have looked fab.","Because the dress is heavy I had to pull it up occasionally, but wearing a bra helped keep it up.","I would recommend a big statement necklace, which I didnt have.","The dress I was sent had visible damage around the bottom of the zipper, about 2 inches on the side of the hip.","I think someone tried to put it on too quickly or it was too small for them.","The RTR people customer service was great and I was given a refund.","I wore it anyway because I did not have time to get a replacement before the event."
"formal affair","Loved the back and I was able to wear a bra by using an extender for low cut dresses, which was a plus."
"formal affair","The dress was a hit!","I got the only size left, which was an 8, and it fit perfect.","The low back is beautiful, but not so low that it makes wearing undergarments impossible.","The shilouette is definitely more modern and fashion forward so you have to have the confidence to rock it.","One complaint is that the top is sequins and rubs.","Does make for some uncomfortable dance moves.","The RTR staff is amazing and made this experience so easy.","Will definitely be using again and recommending to everyone!"
"formal affair","Gorgeous black dress!","Love the slit in the leg and the detail on the shoulder - it adds a little extra to just a plain black dress!","In love with the fit of the dress, too!","It hugs in all of the right places and the material is a very stretchy fabric so it was comfortable throughout the midsection.","Curvier women should size up for fuller hips since it is a snug fit.","This dress works best for A - C cup sizes as it very fitted at the bust, however, sizing up should help since the material is so stretchy!","I wear a size 36D and typically am a size 10 in dresses, and this dress fit, but was a little difficult to zip up over the bust area.","This dress can be worn with a standard bra.","The length just hit the floor in 3 inch heels and I am 52.","I also wore Spanx under to create a smoother look underneath the dress.","Pair with colorful heels or clutch to add a pop of color!"
"formal affair","I ordered a 2R and 4R.","The 4R was a little big, but perfect length with 4 heels.","The 2R fit perfectly, but was a little too short for my heels, so I ended up wearing the larger size."
"formal affair","I received MANY compliments all night long.","I ordered the 8 and the 10, the 10 fit best.","I needed help clamping and zipping the dress I dont think I could have zipped it up on my own.","The dress fits true to size and is very, very classy.","You can really only wear a strapless with this, or it would take a lot of fashion tape to wear a traditional bra.","I would rent this again, loved it!"
"formal affair","Could have worn the 6 but opted for the 8  Loved the dress and I received lots of compliments!","The piping would occasionally stick me under the left breast but not a big deal.","It was a beautiful dress."
"formal affair","I absolutely adore this dress.","It was originally my back-up dress, but I liked it so much better than the original one I had wanted.","I wore it to the George Washington University Inaugural Ball, and despite the fact that I personally knew of at least 5 other people wearing the same dress, it didnt matter.","The color of the dress photographs beautifully, the neckline is very flattering, and the length was perfect."
"formal affair","This is my first RTR and I am very pleased.","I wore this dress to a black tie gala.","I was concerned that the sequin might be too much but it was gorgeous.","I am usually a size 12 and a 14 for back up but 14W was all that was available so I went with it and crossed my fingers!","Bodice was a little big - but nothing a pin couldnt fix!","After that - perfection.","I would NOT rent again because this is so memorable I wouldnt want to wear again.","Perfect dress for the perfect night."
"formal affair","Im usually a 0-2, but based on reviews I ordered 0R and 0P was backup just because I was worried about length of 0R.","The 0P fit perfectly and length was perfect with 3.5 inch heels.","the chest was a little bit big, but easily fixed with the right bra.","Got compliments all night would definitely recommend for a formal event.","Wore with the Kate Spade special occasions necklace and it matched perfectly."
"formal affair","The dress was awesome....it fit so well and was true to size..I thought I would need a size 14 because of my hips, but it was perfect.","I received so many compliments on my dress as well as my daughters dress."
"formal affair","I wore the 8R with 3 inch heels and the length was perfect for me.","The 6R fit but was a little tight around the stomach area so I went with the 8R.","The fabric is thick and stretchy and extremely comfortable.","Really liked the slit on the back of the dress and the cutouts were great!","Really flattering for any body types."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for a cocktail event and received so many compliments!","The dress was a little thicker than usual so I was warm without feeling overwhelmed.","The bow detail was fantastic and added something extra to the dress.","I love this color and would definitely rent this dress again in the future."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to my senior prom, and it was perfect.","I chose to wear the 0R because, while they both fit just about the same, it was a little bit shorter than the size 2.","But right as i tired it on for the first time, it fit like the dress was made for me; if I had bought it, I wouldnt have needed to make any alterations.","Im only 52, so I was concerned it would be too long, but it couldnt have been less than an issue with my 4 heels.","Even when i took my shoes off, the length of the dress wasnt a problem.","I also wore a backless bra because of the open back.","I was complimented the entire evening and just had so much confidence all night.","I cant speak more highly of this dress.","Ill be using RTR again (:"
"formal affair","All around amazing dress, only thing that might bother people is a very visible seamline, but its not too big of a problem."
"formal affair","Wore to semi-formal event.","Fit was excellent.","I typically wear a 10 but the 12 skimmed my body perfectly.","There was no bulging around the cutouts.","The hem is interfaced to make it heavier and keep its flouncy shape.","It was a fun touch and this dress twirled like a dream.","But the construction of the hem was wonky.","It was like the interfacing was too big and bunched up in places so the hem twisted in some places.","It was a little offputting but it was the only negative for me.","You can wear a regular bra but I needed fashion tape to keep the bra straps from slipping out.","The shoulder straps are cut in a little from where a typical bra strap would lay.","Totally recommend this dress."
"formal affair","I loved this dress.","I wore the 8.","My back up was a 10 because I usually have trouble zipping at the top.","But the 8 fit perfect.","I got so many compliments.","It was definitely worth renting.","How often do you get to wear a full length sequin dress?","I wouldnt buy for one occasion.","This was so much fun!!!","!"
"formal affair","I received this gown as a replacement for the one I originally ordered that became unavailable at the last minute due to being returned damaged by someone else.","This gown was pretty,but the material is scratchy and has no give.","I had a size up from my normal in the long length and it still hit me at my ankles with flats on.","There was no way I was going to wear it."
"formal affair","This dress runs short.","I loved the print, fabric and style, but there is no way I could wear this dress to the formal event I ordered it for.","Im just shy of 510 and it didnt even come close to hitting the floor for me (even though I ordered the LONG length in a size up from what I normally wear.)","If youre a tall girl like me you may want to reconsider this selection."
"formal affair","Everyone at the party loved the dress!","It was a bit tight in the legs, and a tad short on my 6 frame.","Great for a curvy figure and I agree with other reviewers that the adjustable straps make a world of difference!"
"formal affair","Loved this dress!!!","I wore it for a formal evening wedding and got lots of complements!","A bit of stretch, hit me right at the knee and was great on my hourglass figure!"
"formal affair","Perfect fit for me, I have a full chest but narrow ribcage.","It was really flattering and did not need a bra, although I did wear stick on cups.","The skirt falls away from the body so it is definitely forgiving if you have curves.","The cut is pretty conservative but it is trendy and fun so I felt comfortable dancing and I got so many compliments.","The only con would be the sequins rub a bit under the arms but not something that would stop me from wanting to own it!","Seriously wish this was a part of my closet."
"formal affair","I rented this dress for  our rehearsal dinner and it was stunning!","I got endless compliments, questions about where to get it etc.. AND I felt great in it!","Its definitely shorter than I normally would wear but it bunched enough in the front that I didnt feel like it was too form fitting.","I wish I could find similar dresses for every occasion that make me feel this good!","VERY open back, so the right bra is key."
"formal affair","I could not have picked a more gorgeous dress to wear to a Halloween gala at the Italian Embassy.","Overall the dress was stunning--beautiful color, great and flattering fit, and pretty chiffon material.","I wasnt able to zip my normal size due to the way the chiffon bunched near the zipper, so the size I wore ended up being a little loose in the bust area, but overall I was extremely happy.","I wore flats and the regular length was perfect.","I incredibly happy with my experience, and the RTR representatives were nice, helpful, and very efficient.","Great experience."
"formal affair","The bust was a bit bigger but I expected that, and wore a bandeau and it fit great.","Love this dress, would rent again!"
"formal affair","The fit was perfect.","The top was snug in all of the right places and the bottom was full and fun.","I loved the pockets on the dress and had a ton of people say how much they loved the dress!","The black and magenta combination was great."
"formal affair","Runs true to size and very forgiving but the length was my only complaint (way too short for taller people, even in long).","The color also had different shades with different sizes which was frustrating for planning.","Overall, just a stunning dress, the minutiae didnt take out from the dress as a whole which was incredible!","!"
"formal affair","."
"formal affair","I loved this dress for a mountain wedding.","The color was a little bit of a deeper green than what was pictured.","The neckline made the fit classy, and the cutouts added the right amount of sass while still being tasteful.","Im usually in between a 2 and 4 and the 6 felt perfect so definitely size up on the backup size.","I agree with some of the other reviewers that say the cutouts can be a little unforgiving -- I was definitely adjusting throughout the day to make sure it wasnt squeezing in an unflattering way.","The skirt was super fun for dancing."
"formal affair","I wore this to an Annual Fundraiser Gala.","The Gala was black-tie optional and I wore a floor length gown last year, so I knew if I was going to go for a short dress, it had to be special.","This dress is very pretty and sparkly with all the sequins and was perfect for the event!","My husband joked that sequins are from the 50s (like he knows fashion haha) but I told him I was bringing sequins back :)  I wear between a 10 and a 12 and the 12 fit okay, but the 10 was definitely a better fit for me.","I also had to use a bit of the fashion tape that RTR sent me to have the top fit well without showing my bra.","I was able to wear a regular tradition bra with this dress which was nice.","Its really hard to describe the color of this dress, its not as silver as it looks in the picture.","It has a pink/ gold tint to it, but I loved that.","The hardest thing for me was finding the best shoes to match.","I ended up going with a pair of ivory shoes that worked well.","I would say if you can find a pair of gold with skinny straps, that they would be perfect.","Overall, I really loved the dress and got a lot of compliments considering everyone else at the Gala looked fantastic!"
"formal affair","I am approximately 5 4.5 and the 0R was too short even without heels on.","Once I put heels on it was really too short.","The jeweled shoulder piece also felt quite tight under my arm, which was rather uncomfortable.","Other than that the fabric felt nice and it was just a long black dress.","I would not rent again."
"formal affair","zipper was sticky/stiff.","lots of structure for the girls.","bra not needed (Im a c)"
"formal affair","You will definitely get a lot of boobs in this dress, however, its simple and elegant and perfect to wear.","I felt like a super star in this dress."
"formal affair","I rented this after my first choice didnt quite work out.","I had worn this in red/coral so I knew it would fit.","The color was gorgeous!","It flowed beautifully and the color was much more vibrant than in this hotel room pic.","Rent it for sure!"
"formal affair","Very happy with this rental.","Wore this to a holiday party - at the end of a busy week - so I was thankful to have an outfit ready, especially one that did not require much else accessorizing or prep.","Didnt need to wear a special bra, didnt even think about wearing spanx, didnt wear anything else besides my usual jewelry (in my opinion the dress is enough on its own), and didnt even have to worry about shoes too much either.","I had planned on wearing this pair of heels but after trying on the dress and realizing its length, I decided to go with a more comfortable platform type of shoe - no one could see it anyway!","- and was so glad I did.","Overall, a beautiful, comfortable and sophisticated dress."
"formal affair","Fits true to size.","Need to wear backless/strapless bra or no bra at all.","No stretch in the fabric but was super comfortable."
"formal affair","After reading the reviews I tried on my backup size of 2R first and it fit perfectly.","I am normally a 4R.","With the skirt being so full and having a little bit of a train, my husband stepped on the back some and it also made a crowded dance floor a little tricky.","I wore flats and the dress skimmed the floor.","Love that the dress has pockets.","I was worried about the front V being very low but it is tacked closed and I never felt exposed.","A fantastic dress, received tons of compliments!"
"formal affair","I loved everything about this dress except the length, which hit the ground on me at 56 while wearing 3 wedges.","But it was worth it to wear the heels in order to wear the dress, which was flattering, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful.","10/10 would rent again."
"formal affair","Free people is such a hit or miss for me.","I got a size 8....and it was  huge on me.","The straps were too loose and just didnt fit well at ALL.","Extremely disappointing."
"formal affair","Fit a little bit large up top but I was able to wear it off the shoulders a bit and it worked out for me.","I loved that I had room and was able to be comfortable all night.","The dress was not very heavy, made for a carefree night."
"formal affair","I didnt get to wear this since it was too short.","Standing flat footed, it was showing my feet...  RTR was quick to help and is sending me out a dress overnight to replace.","I rented this before and realized it was a long... stunning no doubt!"
"formal affair","The dress was great, I unfortunately selected one size too large in error, so there was quite a bit of fabric around the front.","I am pretty sure it would have looked great if it was one size smaller.","But I still loved it and highly recommend this dress as a classic to wear to any event."
"formal affair","Loved loved this dress.","The only fall was I wish I had fashion tape for my boobs!","Perfect length dress though + light material.","Little tight around the ribs but still loved it.","Hits right about the knee."
"formal affair","fit true to size!","great dress, very comfortable.","there was a little stretch but not a ton so still fit very well."
"formal affair","I wore this dress to the annual Blues Ball, which is a really fun black tie event.","I hadnt even gotten out of the cab all the way when someone stopped and said Oh my goodness, I LOVE your dress!.","I recieved compliments all night, which is always nice.",":)  The dress was super comfortable, and was not too short at all- but definitely would be on someone taller than me.","Not too heavy and was perfect for a winter event indoors (I was fine without tights).","The entire RTR experience was perfect.","Will definitely order again!"
"formal affair","I loved this dress.","This was my favorite dress I have worn from RTR ever.","Its super comfortable, the color is beautiful in person and you can also wear a regular bra with it which is really nice.","I wore this for a formal black tie gala and got tons of compliments.","Nice departure from a black dress!"
"formal affair","I ordered the 2P and OP and the fit was pretty similar so I went with the smaller one for the confidence boost.","It just hit the floor in 3 inch heels."
"formal affair","I had a hard time choosing between two dresses and the stylist were awesome at helping me decide which dress would be a better fit for me.","This was my first time with RTR and I couldnt have been more pleased with my experience.","The dress arrived exactly on time and the size recommended fit perfectly.","I typically wear a loose size 12L.","I knew the 14 was going to be too big so I went down a size with a 10L as my backup size.","The 10L was a little tight around my rib/back area because Im pretty wide around, but it was a better fit at keeping the strapless dress up.","I went with the 12L and overall it fit perfectly.","The top of the dress or the boning, tends to bend down (stick out) a little but it wasnt a big deal.","I wore my hair down and long so it covered it.","I am a size 38C, and it can be a little tricky holding up boobs in a strapless dress.","I probably should have used a better bra.","The dress was stretchy on the inside which made it super comfortable.","I really felt beautiful in this dress and got tons of compliments.","This was my 4th Submarine Birthday Ball and by far the best Ive ever looked.","Thank you RTR!!","!"
"formal affair","Simple and elegant, cant wait for next formal event to use rent the runway."
"formal affair","The material feels like you are wearing pajamas, but the cutouts make it look fantastic!","I wore this to a wedding reception, and it hugged my body perfectly.","I am normally a 4, but the 2 fit perfectly, so it runs slightly large.","It is very long, so be prepared to hold it up while dancing."
"formal affair","I tried on a 8R in the store and it was much too short to wear with heels.","The 8L that I ordered was just floor skimming, perfect, with about 2 heels (Im 58).","I loved that I was able to wear a normal black bra with the dress and the straps blended in.","The dress was super flattering without any spanx required.","I had to wear it to multiple awards ceremonies from around 11 am until 9 pm, so a really long day with a lot of sitting, and was very comfortable the whole time.","The style of the dress felt very elegant and almost Great Gatsby.","I paired with simple gold earrings and bracelet.","No major jewelry required.","By the end of the day, I did notice the sequins under my arms irritating my skin a little like other reviews mentioned, but not so much that it was really distracting.","Had I been dancing or moving around more, it may have been more obvious.","All in all, great dress and great rental experience!"
"formal affair","Pros it fit well, was high quality, comfortable, and did not require fussing."
"formal affair","This was a super fun dress!","The cut of the dress made it very comfortable.","The V-neck with wide straps meant I could wear a regular bra and the gathering at the waist meant I could skip the spanx!","A win-win :)The color was fantastic- I would decribe it as rose-gold.","Although I have worn dresses that were more flattering, I still felt great- and special- in this one.","Very pleased with my first experience with Rent the Runway!"
"formal affair","Im smaller up top and wider in the hips.","Usually this puts me between a 0 and a 2.","I thought this dress, because it flairs out at the bottom would be perfect to cover my bottom.","But somehow everything looked incredibly disproportionate on me.","I am petite though so perhaps that is why.","I gave it one star because the material was pretty- a wine red with a little sparkle.","It would have been perfect for a holiday party."
"formal affair","Perfect fit.","Forgiving in what some woman see as problem areas.","Holds in the belly that held twins just 3 years ago, and can make anyone feel truly amazing!"
"formal affair","The fit was about what I expected---very forgiving because of the nature of a vest."
"formal affair","This dress is more beautiful on and in person than in the photos!","I was nervous about the material because I typically stay away from thin, clingy materials but I took a chance on this dress after reading the reviews and was delighted.","There is a layer of boning almost like a corset in the top of the dress that really helps it lay beautifully.","I hate wearing my dresses too tight so I ordered larger sizes.","I typically wear a 16-18 in jeans, dresses and skirts.","I am about 54 and wanted to wear 4 inch heels.","I ordered a size 20R and 22R.","I could have worn either, but I went with the 22R for extra breathing room (for singing) and length over my shoes.","If you are any taller, youll probably want the taller length!","I wore a strapless long line bra and I also wore a mermaid shape slip with tulle under it from Davids Bridal for extra volume in the skirt.","I was wearing the dress while singing in a concert so I wanted a fuller, more formal look.","The combination of the slip and the longline bra made me feel extra comfortable, smoothing out any extra curves I didnt want to appear.","The ruching in this dress is really great and complements curves.","I felt like I could customize it by pulling the waist up or down for more or less ruching.","Will rent again!"
"formal affair","This dress was true to size and is a great classic fit.","It was a little baggie in the stomach area but otherwise a great dress."
"formal affair","This dress fit great.","It was the perfect length for me, tight around the tummy, but not unbearably so.","I loved the low and open back, it made me feel elegant and sexy.","Great for a black-tie affair."
"formal affair","loved this dress -- i received many compliments on it.","both the 8 and 10 fit but i wore the 10 for a little extra length.","i just wish i had gotten the long version because it was a little short with my shoes on."
"other","This was my first RTR experience & all in all it was good.","At first I had a little trouble with the fit.","The 4 was too big in the bust & the 2, I could hardly breathe in.","Thankfully I invested in a majorly padded strapless bra & that helped fill out the 4.","The lace was kind of snagged in a few places & the hook & eye closure was digging into my back all day.","But who said being beautiful wasnt  painful?!","The dress was a gorgeous color & I got plenty of compliments on.","I will rent from RTR again!"
"other","Hard to zip.","Did not end up wearing.","Pretty gown, but not as pretty as picture"
"other","I rented this for my engagement pictures, but didnt end up wearing it.","The color was phenomenal and is a fabulous shade of purple.","I would definitely recommend sizing down, as I also tried the 10 and it was huge in the bust and waist.","I think this would be perfect for a casual wedding or a night on the town.","The skirt was super flirty and the deep V gives that little bit of sexiness."
"other","The top runs very big all around.","I typically wear Medium and think that a small would have been a better fit for me."
"other","The fit was great and flattering, Im glad I ordered a size up for comfortability of the arms.","Unfortunately it showed up with a bit of a stain which wasnt completely noticable until we started taking pictures.","In order to not have to photoshop every single one, I ended up changing into something else.","I wish we could have gotten better shots in this and wish it didnt have a stain.","It fit great."
"other","The dress runs large and hits right above the knee.","Be weary of the orange stitching as it tends to hook onto zippers/buttons."
"other","This is a very short style (model was 57 in a size 0).","The top is pretty open, but there wasnt really a problem keeping everything in."
"other","Dress was great.","Loved the color and easy fit.","Ordered the M and L based on reviews.","M fit great with the exception of chest, where the pleats stretched out.","Went with L and fit great.","Loved the easy fit could eat and drink with ease.","Dress is thin so I suggest appropriate undergarments."
"other","This dress is very form-fitting yet comfortable.","I am 511 and it hit about mid-thigh, and ran pretty true to size.","I would definitely recommend this dress if you are looking for a fun and different dress for a formal, night out, or party!"
"other","The back of the dress was shorter than I had anticipated - I just had to be mindful of the back so I wasnt flashing my behind when I walked up stairs, etc.","The style of the dress is great - the open back is stunning and makes a statement"
"other","Wore this for my childs First Communion at church.","It fit perfectly.","My post-children stomach area is my trouble spot, so I have to look for a dress that will be big enough to cover that up but not too big on top.","This dress was perfect because it was fitted up top and slightly at the waist but the stomach/hips area were flowy so my stomach didnt look bad.","The pictures dont do the lace justice.","In person it looks really lacy and delicate.","If I were taller than 57 it may have started to feel a little shorter than I am comfortable with, but that may be a personal thing.","For me, the length was perfect."
"other","Loved the dress!!","Only negative was the attached slip kept riding up!","The dress hung a little bit around the belly area but I wore spanx and it took care of that issue :)Highly recommend this dress!"
"other","im 5 months pregnant with my second baby.","i ordered this dress for my first babys baptism and I loved it like no other!","Very comfortable and classic.","Fit me very well even tho Im pregnant it fit great.","I had an issue to find a dress that fits my changing body and that i felt comfy in.","I got lots of compliments on the dress, and I got so many parties in May that I would wear that dress to  every one of them, unfortunately same people going to be there... Great dress, super comfortable and elegant!","10/10"
"other","I wore this dress for my high school graduation, and grad party and it was absolutley amazing!","I didnt love it on the model, but took a risk for it that paid off!","It was a beautiful blue with lace, and a very appropriate length, even for me being 59.","It was very flattering and comfortable!","I remember being nervous about ordering a 14, as I usually wear a 16 but the 16 wasnt available and other reviews stated it ran big, and the 14 fit perfectly!"
"other","LBD!","This dress fit like a glove and im usually and XS/S.","I would say this runs true to size but leans towards a touch small.","It was a very appropriate length on me, above the knee.","It was snug throughout but not too tight.","There are not zippers, ya jsut gotta shimmy into it.","Material has some stretch.","Would wear to a semi formal event or on a date."
"other","The dress didnt seem to fit how I liked it even though the dress was really pretty.","Go a size smaller if you want the dress to be fitted"
"other","Amazing bell sleeves!","Definitely a unique shirt.","It definitely looks better in person and on your body than on the model.","I tucked the front of the shirt into high waisted shorts for a fun summer outfit.","Top doesnt dip too low, could definitely wear to work and not worry.","I would recommend sizing up for your backup size."
"other","The dress is stunning on.","Its very professional and white house, expensive looking.","Its a corduroy like material, which is kinda weird being the model photo doesnt show this texture.","I received both sizes 2 and 4 (normally I wear a 0 or a 2) The 2 was to tight in the bust and arm holes.","The size 2 did fit if I didnt want to move my arms or breath, so I opted to not split at the seams and wear the 4.","I needed to give it a once over with my iron on a low setting, no steam, inside out  to get the wrinkles out from the shipping.","It was perfect for my formal business lunch, paired with a chunky pearl necklace and nude heels.","I would suggest nude heels over black or white since the dress up close the color has a hue of cream.","The structure of the dress is well made and sturdy and will hide any muffin top nicely.","It does not stretch sideways only a teeny, tiny bit long ways.","I would rent this dress again in the future for any day time semi to formal event.","In my opinion this is not an evening dress."
"other","The dress runs a bit large.","I was worried that shape wouldnt be flattering, but I felt good in it.","My only complaint is that the underside of the bell sleeves and skirt is light in color.","Also, the sleeves were 3/4 on me which seemed kind of strange for a bell sleeve but actually was more practical for doing things like washing my hands or eating."
"other","I wore this to a baby shower.","It fit perfectly, and I didnt need a bra.","The arms were a bit restrictive but it was fine, just couldnt lift them up too high.","I loved this dress."

"other","A stunningly flattering sheath by La Petite Robe di Chiara Boni.","Running true to size with a lot of stretch, we recommend sizing up for backup.","My typical size 2 fit perfectly and was very comfortable throughout the bodice and arms.","Its important to note that there is no zipper so you do need to step into this dress.","As well, this dress has a built in bra, need for undergarments!","Pair with clean heels and simple accessories."
"other","I rented this for 20s Halloween costume.","It was perfect for that.","Runs almost TTS, maybe slightly large.","Beading was in great shape.","Not too heavy.","The neckhole is small so put it on before you do your hair!","Slightly long on me (Im 52) but still totally cute."
"other","if you have a smaller chest you may want to size down."
"other","I wore this for our engagement pictures and it photographed beautifully!","Long hair gets caught on sequins , but not a big deal since I only had it on for less than an hour.","I am 54, 36D, 140lb and ordered a 6L b/c previous posts stated it was short in length when they ordered a regular length and I am glad I ordered the 6L because with my 4 inch heels as you can see it swept the floor perfectly."
"other","Great structure- very flattering and comfortable"
"other","I wore this dress for my college graduation.","The fabric was light enough to wear under my graduation gown.","The fit balanced the bold print perfectly.","This was a great find!"
"other","I have rented a handful of dresses from RTR and this one by far is my favorite!","It is so comfortable and can easily be dressed up or down.","I was a little nervous about not wearing a bra, as there is no support AT ALL,  but it turned out fine!","The regular length was fine for me because I was going to a casual event and wearing flats, however if i had needed to wear heels it may had been a tad too short."
"other","The dress is very low cut and wide cute as well, so be ready with either double sided tape and/or nipple covers.","There is also a seam on the natural waist.","This dress does not stretch at all so if you are worried about it being tight, get the size up.","All in all, it is perfect for a holiday party or cocktail event!","I wanted to wear it without tights but I had a giant bruise on my leg.","Looks great either way though."
"other","Loved the color.","The cut in the front was a bit low, but I did not mind.","The material was nice and breathable.","It was perfect!"
"other","I rented this dress for an Engagement Party that I was co-hosting.","The party wasnt formal or informal, but I knew that I wanted something nice enough to stand out.","The color is beautiful!","Its a little brighter than the pictures - More magenta than plum.","I didnt discover that it had pockets until almost the end of the night, but how doesnt love pockets??","I loved this dress overall.","Its more conservative than I usually go, but so elegant."

"other","Great dress.","Fit great, besides a little large in the top, but I have a small bust.","Im 58, and if I were any taller it would be too short!"
"other","Wore for a Bachelorette Party in Atlantic City.","The group was fairly conservative and we werent hitting any clubs so it was the perfect vibe.","A little playful (short) without being too revealing.","Paired perfectly with nude heels.","My problem is my midsection and this was a fairly flattering dress especially with a pair of Spanx.","I usually wear a size 4 or 6.","This dress was form-fitting but definitely not too tight.","None of the pictures had a great shot of the dress."
"other","14 was my backup size for another dress, but they didnt send it (it sounded like someone didnt return it in time?","), so they sent me the 12 in that and the 14 in this.","Ironically, the 14 in that and the 12 in this would have fit me better.","The 14 hung like a sack, so I added a belt, which worked okay.","Im usually a 12, so I suspect it runs true to size.","A woman passed me at the event and said: That dress is GORGEOUS.","You should never wear any other dress than this one.","Ha!"
"other","This was such a fun romper!!","I got so many compliments from other concert-goers.","It was comfortable in the sense that I didnt have to worry about re-adjusting any part of the outfit all night.","However, the wires in the bodice were poking me all night.","But honestly I wasnt that upset about it since it was such a fun outfit on such a fun night ;)"
"other","The 4 fit better but was a little to short.","The shoulder and back was a little loser than I would have liked.","That is wear the 4 felt better.","I wore stickies but didnt need them.","The dress has lining so going bra less isnt a problem.","Got a lot of compliments.","The back is gorgeous!"
"other","This is my favorite look of the new season!","I love the color and detail of this style.","The fabric has a lot of stretch, however it is fitted along the natural waist and hips.","This dress works best for anyone with a smaller bust as it does have a very deep V-neck.","This is such a fun style for both a formal and casual affair.","You can easily complete the look with colorful earrings and the perfect shoes!"
"other","I have fairly large boobs and the top was way too big.","I tightened the straps so ended up being fine, but not very flatter on top.","Cant wear a bar so I wore sticky boobs but it was so hot and humid they kept falling off.","The fabric gathered slightly over the boobs so ended up being fine without a bra.","Long, so wore with wedges.","Pockets were awesome, but one pocket was sewn different than the other so I couldnt still both of my hands in — kind of bothered me, but I got over it.","I would rent again though."

"other","I wore this to a Mardi Gras ball that is black tie.","I got SO many compliments!","I am normally a size 6.","I tried both the 6R and 4L - both actually fit similarly but I liked the length of the L better (it skimmed the floor with 4in heels vs the 6 which showed my feet).","I did wear Spanx which smoothed my curves a little better under the 4.","I highly recommend this dress!"
"other","I usually wear a 6, but can wear anything from a 2 to 8 in dresses.","The 4 fit me just as well as the 6.","I went for the 6 just because it gave me a little more room.","My mom told me the 4 flattened my non-existing chest more, so I figured the 6 would be better, especially since I had to wear the dress at work all day before my pictures."
"other","I chose this dress for my engagement party as Im 3 months pregnant and it was the first time Id have both my fiances family and mine together so I wanted to be sexy yet conservative.","This dress was super comfortable and hid my little bump perfectly.","The lace and nude dress underneath are a great compliment to each other, Im a curvy girl and this hugged all the right places!","I really liked the lower back V of this dress, it added that sexy umph that the other lace dresses didnt have.","Everyone kept complimenting me the whole night!","This dress can fit someone with size 14 hips/jeans Im more or less a 38B (hormones/body growth keep me guessing what size lol) and size 12 worked for me!"
"other","This dress is beautiful, but the fabric is very thick.","I felt like the dress made me look larger than I am.","However, the cut outs hit just right.","Im short (5 3 ) and the dress hit a little longer than I think it was intended.","Overall, not a bad dress."
"other","Torso fit amazing on this dress and was very flattering.","Unfortunately, it was too long and had too much material on the bottom for someone who is 51 and petite.","Very pretty dress though!"
"other","This dress is flowy and the back is absolutely gorgeous.","I recently had foot surgery and wore this dress to cover my walking boot.","The Small/Long was perfect and had an inch to spare at the bottom with my 58 frame.","I used pasties for this dress as my bust is on the smaller size and was so comfortable all day long."

"other","Comfortable, yet classy!","This dress runs true to size, we recommend going one size up for backup.","Works best for A to C cup sizes (fitted at bust), fit of waist ( straight).","Curvier woman should size up for full hips.","At 54, this style hit at the floor length.","This can be worn with a standard or strapless bra.","We recommend wearing spanx for the seamless look!","At the height of 54, we recommend wearing 3 inches of heels for the perfect length look.","Overall, this look is great and very comfortable and the touch of ruffles makes the dress look very elegant!"
"other","I wore this dress for a funeral - and it felt elegant, but understated - which I liked.","As other reviewers have noted, it does run big - I will wear a 4 or 6 depending on the designer - and the 4 worked, but if I wanted a tighter fit (which I didnt), I probably could have gone down to a 2."
"other","Loved this Trina Turk style!","It is definitely something that I would normally would not rent but after trying it on it is something that I plan on renting in the future.","It ran a little big and I could have easily worn the size 4 as well.","Due to the loose fit it works great for any bust size or body type.","Due to the neckline I would recommend going braless or wearing a strapless bra.","At 55, it did hit right above the knee.","I would pair it with sleek jewelry and open toed heels to complete the look!"
"other","The only thing that was a bit annoying  was the zipper."
"other","This was a nice cozy sweater dress that was very flattering for my figure.","It was comfortable and attractive and I received many compliments.","Like others have said, it runs large, and I could have easily worn the medium but it showed a bit too much cleavage for a professional event."

"other","I loved the color of this dress and wanted something feminine and conservative.","It was completely appropriate for a baby shower.","I would only recommend this dress be worn in the fall or winter because it can be hot with all the layers.","Other than that, it fit very well and I can move in it.","Also, I originally reserved this dress in a size 2.","But I was wrong.","I needed a size 4.","#moniquelhuiller #lacedress #babyshower #conservative #purpledress"
"other","I rented the dress after having twins 3 months ago for a baptism.","It was super comfortable and flattering.","Most of all it hid all my slight imperfections.","The print camouflaged my mommy pooch and the cut of the dress extenuated my new nursing boobs!","I wore a little camisole under to be a little modest just because of the type of the event I was attending.","The rumors are true, a wrap dress is every girls friend no matter what size!","I wish I could keep this dress.","It definitely should be a staple in every womens closet!"
"other","True to size.","A bit short for a work dress."
"other","I absolutely adored this dress!","I wore it to my brother-in-laws rehearsal dinner.","It was perfect and I received many compliments.","It fits true to size, but if youre in between sizes I would recommend going down a size.","The navy color and material of the dress make it so classy and elegant, yet not old.","I will definitely rent this dress again."

"other","Runs a bit big if you are a large order a medium"
"other","I really love this style!","Its super cute and has a great pastel color.","I would say its more of a lavender rose color in person.","The size 2 fit me very well, but its definitely a mini dress (Im 57) so I would not recommend this for a more conservative event.","Another fabulous part of this dress is the built in bra!","Just note that it definitely is a bit smaller in the bust area, so Id size up if youre larger in the bust.","I recommend styling this dress with statement earrings and a fabulous bangle!"

"other","Perfect length for 2-3 inch stilettos.","Fits great, super comfortable.","Flattering even with my belly being my issue (thank God for Spanx!)","Dress up or down.","Wore with a champagne pashmina, black stilettos, and a chunky jewel necklace."
"other","Both the size 6 and size 8 fit in the dress for me, the 8 being just a bit more comfortable in the chest and a more conservative length for the church event.","Its very well made and warm, so if renting in the summer beware.","Color is beautiful.","Overall, I would recommend."

"other","Beautiful dress - runs true to size and makes a girl feel beautiful!"
"other","way better in person, I LOVED this dress!","and i wasnt even sure it i would like it!"
"other","cons, for a 32B the top was large.","I played with the wrap to get it to work, but if you have a small chest, consider a push up or padded bra."
"other","A dark floral print and structured cut make this Carven a must for fall.","Running true to size with no stretch in the fabric we recommend sizing up one size for backup.","If youre a 36C cup or higher you may want to consider sizing up for your primary size as the bust is more fitted with little room for movement.","As for undergarments, we recommend a strapless bra to avoid any straps showing.","At 57 this style hit at about mid-thigh.","Pair with heeled boots for a more casual look or simple heels for a dressier vibe."
"other","May need a belt if youre not pregnant to slim it a bit, but it was perfect for what I needed it for."
"other","The jumpsuit fit well and all-in-all it was fine, but the color really wasnt great.","I have an olivy skintone and this pale pink really washed me out.","I wore this out for Easter service, brunch and the Easter Parade on 5th Ave. Usually with RTR outfits I get many compliments from complete strangers and this outfit didnt get any.","Really just very plain."
"other","Dont get me wrong, I love short dresses, especially for a long sleeved dress, I wanted to show off my legs but I was going to an awards show after party and I couldnt imagine bending down!","I did wear it to dinner the night before the party ( This was my backup choice, but I was sitting the whole time) I wore the M even though I had the L, but the L was not longer so I wore the M.  The material is super thick so its great for a cold evening but be aware that because the fabric is thick it does provide some padding...I loved it, but wish it wouldve been a tad longer"
"other","I wore the dress for our anniversary in Vegas.","It was a va-va-voom dress.","I was a little worried that the bust would not fit bc there is no give in the fabric.","No worries, the small fit perfectly!","I should mention that Im 54 so  the dress fit a little longer than the gal modeling it but I thought it was a nice length.","When I walked in the room, my husband said all eyes were on me.","Rent this dress, you wont regret it."
"other","Rented this for a family photo shoot.","Was very flattering, and a great color.","Wrinkles easily.","I wish the ruffles on the sleeves laid better on my arm.","Sometimes they flapped inward."
"other","I loved the fit of the dress and it was perfect for taking some family photos in!","I do agree with other girls though and had to wear a cami under the dress because the seams were a bit itchy but it became a non-issue once I wore the cami.","Loved it!"
"other","The sleeves, midi-length & high neckline were perfect for a winter charity event for a catholic school.","The material is a touch stretch-y, which was nice.","I did find the cut to be tight on the arms and chest/lats."
"other","I love love DVF and this dress simply did not do her justice.","Fit fine and was pretty but nothing amazing about it."
"other","This dress was pretty short and I wanted to dress it down, so I wore black jeans underneath.","Worked like a charm!","I also had to sit for the performance, so without pants it would have been unwearable.","I normally wear a 10 or an 8, but would have gone up another size if I could have.","Runs small.","I recommend sizing up as an option -- a belt would look great with it anyway."
"other","Based on other reviews, I rented a 2 and a 4.","The 2 fit perfectly at the waist, but it was far too constricting across the chest.","I thought I could make it work, but I actually had a bit of trouble breathing after a few minutes.","Thats how tight it was.","The 4 was comfortable snug across the chest, but the waist was loose.","As a result, the overall look wasnt that flattering, because the dress most interesting detail is its waist line.","Its a nice dress and it obviously was a great choice for lots of other reviewers.","It just fit oddly for me.","I am between 55- 56, a 34C bust, and I weigh 120- 125 lbs."
"other","The dress fit true to size including being fitted in the waist.","The high-low is not too high in the front which makes it appropriate for any occasion.","The fabric is high-quality with a slight sheen.","Would absolutely rent this one again."
"other","Dressed was slightly on the small side.","I wore a size up from what I normally rent and it fit well.","I am 55 and it was somewhat high on my thighs but nothing terrible.","The cape-like feel of the sleeves and the high neck made this dress the perfect outfit for my nieces baptism.","Also, this has been the best photographed dress I have ever rented from RTR."
"other","The size fit me perfectly & I received many compliments, but I dont think Id rent again because I dont like the rauching & feel there was way too much of it on the front stomach area.","Im lean & I feel rauching adds unnecessary bulk on my frame.","Also, the sequins can be itchy.","The dress has a lot of material--a thick inner lining layer & outer sequin layer, so great for wintery events, but a little heavy & hot if you dance a lot.","Happily, you dont ned a bra for this dress, but you can if you prefer.","If you rent this dress, be sure to rent the ben-anum gold deco crystal teardrop earrings--perfect match!"
"other","I loved the fit of this dress!","It was both modest and fun.","The waist made the dress very flattering.","The back of the dress is sheer so I did not wear a bra with this dress."
"other","I loved this dress.","I wore it for a friends rehearsal dinner.","I ordered it in a medium with a backup size of a Small and ended up wearing the small.","The medium looked too big on me (and made me feel good about myself!).","I originally paired the dress with 4.5 nude sandals but it made the dress look too short in the front so I switched to shorter black wedges.","It is very versatile, can be dressed up or made to look more casual depending on the shoe."
"other","I love the color of this dress, so obviously had to rent it!","unfortunately its not flattering on my body type.","im petite, but am large chested.","the bagginess of the slouch fit did not complement me well.","but its a beautiful dress and on the right body type would be extremely flattering!"
"other","I rented this for a huge Thanksgiving dinner.","It is extremely short on the sides, so I wore black tights with it to try and make the shortness less noticeable.","Overall, the previous reviews were very accurate in it running very big.","The small ended up fitting perfectly and you could tie the waist a little tighter if you wanted to try cover up a little more in the chest area.","I got lots of compliments and would definitely rent again!"
"other","Material is light and comfy and the dress is cute ... color is really nice too."
"other","This was my first time renting a dress from RTR and everything went perfectly!","I received everything on time and in great condition.","I was a little nervous about the length of the dress because Im pretty tall and I was going to be wearing it on stage for my NHS induction, but it wasnt too short.","I ordered a 4 and a 6, but ended up wearing the 4."

"other","Unique print and easy to match in black and white!","Running true to size with room in the bust, waist, and hips we recommend sizing up for backup.","The silk material has some gives and is very comfortable.","Its important to note that the buttons only go up so far and allow for a deep-v neckline (as shown on model).","Pair with dark bottoms and sleek jewelry."
"other","Fit perfect.","Comfortable.","Great red color!","Bold but not too loud."
"other","The cut of this dress is beautiful.","If I had owned it, though, I would have had it taken in at the waist.","The size 0 fit great in the bust so there is ample room up top.","The problem I had with the dress is how well-loved it looked.","The dress I received had been worn a few times, without a doubt...thats the only reason it doesnt get at least 4 stars.","The regular was plenty long for me...but I would probably opt for a long if I was wearing heels over 2.5 inches."
"other","Arrived with tags!","The length was perfect with 5 inch heels, I am 53.","Love the pocket detail.","I have curvy hips and it did not pucker at the pockets like other jumpsuits.","Very flattering fit!"

"other","THIS DRESS IS SO HOT.","I felt like a million bucks in this!","The color is just so gorgeous.","I got compliments on it all night and I felt like a total rock star.","Its pretty tight, so I wore some serious organ-crushing spanx underneath, but it was completely worth it.","I wish I could have kept this dress!","When I tried it on for the first time, my boyfriend could not stop telling me how much he loved it.","Would definitely rent again!"
"other","I rented this along with the Dress Me Up necklace for my bridal shower and it was a big hit!","Everyone complimented me on it, some asked to borrow it...","I said no, but you can rent it!","I think 4 friends signed up for RTR while I opened gifts.","Im normally an 8 in dresses and 10-12 in jeans depending on the brand, and the 8 fit nearly perfectly.","It was a tiny bit tight in the arm holes, but I have kind of big arms.","(Photobomb by my sister in the Mark & James by Badgley Mischka Banana Pepper Dress, she loved that one too!)"
"other","This dress is awesome.","It was so incredibly flattering, slimming, though the top runs a bit big, so I recommend going down a size (though it definitely makes it a lot shorter).","If it wasnt 800$, Id totally buy this dress.","Id wear it all the time."

"other","Love the back of this dress!","This designer usually runs true to size, so I recommend going up for the back up size.","With no stretch to the fabric and a tighter fit in the top area, this piece is best for A-C cup sizes.","This style is fitted at waist and natural waist, but comfortable at the hips.","With this backless style, its best to wear no bra, or the NuBra.","Im 55 and wearing 3 inch heels, so the Regular length just touched the floor."
"other","There was no real difference in the 6 regular and the 6 long, but I went with the long anyways.","Fun dress that feels a bit short with heels on (I am 58).","Perfect for shimmer without blinding people."

"other","I wish so badly this dress could stay in my closet.","Its just lovely.","I wore it to graduation and received so many compliments.","It fit perfectly and the fabric is gorgeous.","So polished.","This ones a winner!"
"other","This dress is a gorgeous Autumn, deep forest green.","The material wasnt what I was expecting.","It was linen, but could pass for raw silk.","The ruching makes it very forgiving of flaws - no Spanx needed, so very comfortable and easy to wear, but you need a slip because it is very sheer, see-though and unlined.","This dress fell to just below my knees, which made it the perfect conservative length for work.","It wrinkles easily but the ruching also makes it look like it is supposed to be somewhat wrinkly.","I used one piece of fashion tape to stick the left shoulder to my bra strap, to make sure it didnt become visible.","I wore it with emerald earrings and it was gorgeous for a day at work and an office holiday party afterwards."
"other","Cute shirt, runs a bit big and once you figure out how to tie the sleeves all is good!"
"other","This dress is the perfect outfit for formal event or even prom.","It has built in boning for support in the bust area, and its fitted at the natural waist.","I would recommend sizing up if you have a bigger bust and waist.","If you are 56 or taller I would go for the Long length as the Regular length was perfect on me with heels!"
"other","Rented this for Greek Easter this year, and it was perfect!","With the humidity and high heat after a huge rainstorm, this dress was the perfect thing to wear.","It wasnt tight at all so it was super breezy and the navy/ blue ribbons on the dress added the right touch of color.","It is cut in a high low pattern on the hem, and i found the shorter side to almost be too short when sitting down.","Try to steer clear of chair with an open back.","I was also able to wear a regular nude colored bra with it and didnt have any issues of it being see through (major concern when wearing white!",")."
"other","I rented this for a Conference/ Industry Market.","I needed to be fashion forward while staying professional.","The dress needed to also be comfortable because I would be on the move from 8am to 8pm.","It worked for what i needed it to, but the lining of the dress would bunch up and make creases in the dress during the day.","Also the arms were tighter than i would like, but it didnt really bother me too much.","I would suggest this for a Wedding or Baby shower."
"other","My torso was too long for this baby."
"other","I rented this dress in a size 6 and a size 8.","The size 6 was too tight so I wore the size 8.","The size 8 fit, but the straps were too big.","I had my Mom pin the straps to prevent the straps from falling off my shoulders.","#bacheloretteparty"
"other","The idea of the dress is nice but it was a bit large around the bust.","It was long as well, but that part was expected."
"other","I wore this dress to The Night of Broadway Stars to raise money for Covenant House.","The dress was very comfortable and dressed up nicely with a nice pair of shoes.","Love how the dress holds your bra strap so you dont have to worry about it sticking out.","Could have gone with a 4, which I usually wear."
"other","This one was a little longer on me (Im very short) and just wasnt doing it for me."
"other","You will feel like a million in this beauty."
"other","I wore this to a cocktail party and later to a wine bar.","I wear a 6 normally and this fit perfectly.","I am short, so it was a bit long on me, but I wore this to a work function, so the length was appropriate.","The material is heavy so the dress maintains its shape very well.","I really, really liked the dress!"
"other","Im only 52 and large busted so was worried peep hole would be too low and revealing as I was wearing this for a work event.","Dress fit me perfectly, good length, slenderizing and comfortable.","Beautiful color in which I received numerous compliments throughout the evening.","Very slight con in that peep hole didnt stay center so Id adjust every so often but I would wear this dress again.","It arrived a day late which was unfortunate and out of the norm for RTR.","Overall, fantastic dress!"
"other","People stopped me on the street to ask me where I found these!","They have a very warm and cozy lining that makes them perfect for winter and cold climates.","They were suprisingly flattering- I was second-guessing my decision to order these, but I adored them!","I am somewhat curvy and typically am right between a small and a medium, but the small fit even my thighs & booty perfectly ;)"
"other","I was sure that Id end up needing a medium based on some reviews because I am a curvy size 4 or 6; however, the small was absolutely perfect.","On a chilly, rainy March night, the weight of the dress with the longer sleeves, I didnt have to bother wearing a jacket or a wrap.","And it was perfect for being inside a restaurant and lounge area where other people felt chilly.","Id rent this dress again!","The ONLY down side was having to return the dress."
"other","I absolutely LOVED the way this dress fit.","It hit right at my knee, was fitted at the waist, and had the perfect amount of stretch.","I typically wear a 2, but I went with the 4 because my shoulders are big and my chest isnt small.","I felt more comfortable in the 4, but could have worn the 2 because there is a fair amount of stretch in the fabric.","Super comfortable.","Pockets were great.","I wore this to a quasi-formal ceremony at my university and it fit the occasion perfectly.","TONS of compliments.","Wish I owned this dress."
"other","I loved this dress.","The weight of the fabric was great, and very forgiving.","Busty ladies like me will have no issues with fit, but the pleats at the bust will be something you either love or hate (I loved).","Hides upper arms is that is a problem area.","Would definitely rent again, but without the pearl strand necklace that was recommended...it was just too much."
"other","Great dress.","It is one that people will comment on, so you must be ready to be the center of attention.","Phenomenal fit for my body-type.","Im 59, 160lbs-  I carry more weight in my top half than I do in my legs.","The neckline was very flattering, AND I was able to wear a real bra.","With straps!","The band in the middle hits at an incredibly flattering point.","The zipper was a little tricky, but the dress made me feel like a million bucks."
"other","I am 58, 54 144 lbs- but a fit 144lbs.","34D bust and narrow hipped.","The Med was too snug through stomach But fit a little better through shoulders and chest.","The large fit better in stomach but shoulders kept falling down.","I wore the large, felt great in the dress- the length is wonderful.","Both sizes had issues with the shoulders falling down."
"other","RUNS BIG.","I wear an 8 and I rented a 6 but should have gotten a 2.","Moves beautifully!!","!"
"other","The tops fit great!","The leggings had almost zero to no stretch at the top.","They barely made it up over my hips.","Once on all was well but it was a struggle getting them up if I went to the bathroom etc.","I wear Nike leggings all the time (size small) to work out.","Never had this issue before."
"other","Beautiful dress, fit me perfectly!"
"other","This dress is a great for a an all white party or even a bridal shower.","There is plenty of room in the bust so I would recommend sizing down if you have a smaller chest.","The sleeves are great too if you are self conscious about your arms."
"other","I got the 2L as well (they didnt have a 0T) but the 0R ended up working perfectly!","The 2 was big around the chest, and being 510 I was scared about the length but the 0R was absolutely perfect length with flats.","Loved this dress."
"other","Loved it.","Got tons of compliments.","Looks amazing in pictures, as the sun really maded it sparkle.","Would have loved to keep it."

"other","I loved this dress!","I rented it for Easter Sunday and it was very comfortable.","A little on the shorter side, but not too short.","I could wear running shorts under it.","Fabric was thick but soft and not too hot.","Fit true to size."
"other","The only downside for me was that the waist wasnt very tight, so I looked a bit wider than I am."
"other","This dress looks so much nicer in person than in the picture.","It fits pretty true to size.","Im in-between sizes right now trying to lose the last of some baby weight.","The 10 could have been worn, but the 12 felt more appropriate for church.","If I had been wearing it anywhere else, I would have gone with the slightly more fitted 10 that showed my figure.","Even though the 12 was a little looser it skimmed my curves instead of hugged them and did not look matronly as some of the other dresses tend to if going up in size.","Overall a winner and I will be looking for other Rachel Roy dresses due to great fit and overall top quality and feel of the dresses."
"other","I wore it to a beach themed bridal shower.","I wore the LL (the regular lengths werent available), with flats it wasnt too long.","I just had to be careful when stepping back as I would catch it then.","Overall this was a great dress, I loved how it fit and was comfortable while moving around with bridesmaid duties during the luncheon."
"other","The dress is gorgeous!","It fit great.","I wore it for NYE and it was perfect.","I could have worn the 0 but given that my night was spent eating, I went with the 2 so Id have more room for food.","I would buy this dress in a minute if I could afford it, its that great!"
"other","This dress is the perfect combination of sexy, yet classy!","I wore this with a strapless bra and added a strap the same direction as the strap of the dress and it was perfect!","It does run a little snug if you have a fuller rib cage area.","I tried on the 6, but I couldnt get the zipper up so I went with the 8 which was a little looser in the bust, but still looked stunning!","I highly recommend this dress!","!"
"other","I ordered the 0 as my primary size with the 2 as the backup - thank goodness for backup sizes!","The 0 was just a tad too tight + when it was fully zipped, there was unfortunately a tear in the back that was exposed and would show (so regardless, I wouldnt be able to wear that size).","The 2 was comfortable with a little room to give.","The lining inside the dress was actually coming undone.","Thankfully this didnt show or affect the dress.","I received endless compliments on the dress with multiple people asking me where I got it.","It is a very flattering dress on!","Just know that it is somewhat see through with the top half so a nude bra is a must."
"other","I really loved the way this dress fit.","I typically wear between a 2 and a 4 and the 4 fit me really well.","I love the pockets on this dress, how comfortable it is, and the fun skirt!","I got a lot of compliments on it and would definitely rent it again!","I wore a regular bra with it and had no issues with the back of the dress.","I love that the back goes down so low - very fun and sexy!"

"other","Wore to see a Broadway show.","Fit was great: snug, great skirt.","LBD but with a pattern."
"other","This dress is very interesting and unique.","It runs large and the fabric has no stretch.","The dress is the most fitting in the waist section.","Great for Easter!","Colorful shoes and accessories would really look nice.","there is plenty of room in the bust area and I would recommend sizing down for back up."
"other","I rented this dress for a Spain-themed dinner.","I rented the 0R and 2R.","The 0R was not sent to me, so luckily enough the 2R fit perfect.","Dress is true to size.","I received tons of compliments.","I had no issues at all with the dress."
"other","I was so excited to get this dress.","It was the perfect high fashion look I needed.","The pattern and structure was amazing.","My biggest problem was that there was NO GIVE around the cut out.","There was stretch in the rest of the dress but I felt like I was wearing a belt!","It hit me on the biggest part of my waist, my ribs.","If youre worried about wearing a cut out, dont do this one."
"other","The dress runs true to size.","It hangs pretty nicely and is dressy enough for a celebration dinner with friends, but not so over the top that you look like youre going to a wedding.","My only issue was when I walked, the innermost layer of the dress kept riding between my legs so I kept having to adjust it."
"other","I wore this to renew our vows on our 20th wedding anniversary.","This was the only dress I liked that looked PLATINUM (and not necessarily silver)  The dress fit t is very forgiving.","I tried on the 8 first and it felt great & comfortable.","I then tried on the 6 and it defined my curves a bit more and looked even better.","I would have preferred the drape in the back to be a bit higher, but getting a low strap bra is not a big deal either.","The dress is simply stunning.","The style is clean and flattering which makes the DRAMA of the dress classy.","The 6 did arrive ripped which was disappointing.","I was able to put a quick few stitches in the seam and it wasnt noticeable.","Had this been any other dress, that would not have worked."
"other","The dress was a little tight around my ribs but the material hid it well.","I love how flowy the dress.","Its dressy yet casual so can be worn to many different occasions.","I highly recommend!"
"other","I wore this dress for a baptism and then an evening out with my husband and felt elegant the entire night.","It was also very comfortable and flattering on my pear shaped frame.","I loved the soft pink that is in this dress and would definitely recommend if youre on the fence about this one.","I usually wear a 4 or 6, and the 4 was just right in this dress.","Such a beautiful dress!"
"other","Cannot describe how perfect this dress was.","Wore it to prom as a chaperone.","Perfect length - hit right about the knee and Im 53 and was wearing a low heel.","The shape of the dress was very flattering.","I normally wear a 6 but wore the 8 because the top was a little snug and fabric doesnt give - like other reviewers Id definitely recommend sizing up for your backup size.","I got so many compliments throughout the night!","No complaints."
"other","I wore this dress for a fundraising gala.","It was very comfortable and soo cute!","I wore an XS (my usual size) and felt it was still quite big.","Luckily, I liked the way it looked extra loose!","I am also very short (5 foot) so the dress was much longer on me than it is on the model.","I loved it and would definitely want to rent it again!"
"other","I really liked this dress.","It was flattering and the scoop back made it a little sexy.","Lots of bling too!","Depending on how you moved it did scratch a little but not bad."
"other","The dress was very comfortable and not restricting.","It was a little low cut for my taste but it was by no means excessive.","I would definitely wear this again for a casual event/summer party."
"other","It fits really nice.","I am shorter and an hourglass.","This was really flattering but it is revealing.","I am definitely large in the chest but I think even Bs, Cs would fit it to be revealing.","Still loved it."
"other","fit was true to size, hides any tummy bloat.","Really soft and beautiful fabric"
"other","Pretty basic Nike active wear, I did like the shirt and the sweatshirt a lot and they fit perfectly.","The pants are a totally different story though.","I own a lot of Nike pants in Small but these were definitely way too small.","To the point they literally would not fit."
"other","This style is such a comfortable and versatile look!","This long sleeve shift is perfect for a casual get together or you can glam it up with accessories for a cocktail party.","The material is very comfortable and has some stretch to it.","The sleeves have zippers, which make them fun to adjust.","There is plenty of room in the bust, but if you have broader shoulders, I would suggest sizing up.","The high-low length is great for the autumn and this style will work with or without tights."
"other","Very true to fit.","The neck was a little to low for me so I pinned it closed more."
"other","I rented this dress for my sisters prom pics and for my bday dinner.","This was my second rental and overall I liked it.","Im 51 and a size 10 so it wasnt as short as I would of hoped.","It is big under the arms and couldnt wear a regular bra with it.","I would suggest to rent ur regular size and a smaller size as ur backup.","Its light weight and easy to wear I would prob rent again."
"other","Fit is so flattering!","Color is amazing.","True to size!","The material stretches a little so its forgiving!","Perfect for my save the date video!","Wish I could have this in my closet!","Would give 10 stars!!","!"
"other","This dress was much smaller than expected.","Im short-waisted, but the waist hit me around my rib cage -- too high.","The length was mid-thigh (Im 59) as opposed to the knee length shown on the model.","The material is thin and crinkly and not very special.","But if you are a small person living in a warmer climate, I think it might be cute and comfortable."
"other","Im not sure what I was expecting, but this dress isnt at all dressy.","I rented it for a graduation party, but it was more suited for a casual Saturday.","Cute, but very casual."
"other","I wore this dress for Easter !!!","The dress fit me like a glove.","The color really stood out.","I could not walk five feet through my church without getting complimented on how lovely I look.","One of my church members even told me,I looked like a Barbie Doll come to life.","The sleeves are a bit tight,so I would not recommend renting this dress if you are going to be doing something ,like dancing.","But overall a very  lovely experience :)"
"other","This dress was my second choice, but my first pick arrived damaged.","I wore the size 6 and was comfortable all evening in the dress, aside from the times I needed to climb into and out of the limosine, the dress is short and makes for difficulty manuevering while bent over.","Other than that it was as described, and I received compliments throughout the evening.","I would say it is a good choice for a night out."
"other","As most people have probably figured out by now, this dress is more of a candy apple green than a mint green.","RTR should really take new photos of the model to show this.","Thankfully I have tan skin so this color looked good on me.","The lace was beautiful and I liked the material a lot, but even the 0 was too big on me.","I wore a belt with it to give me more of a waist since it was too wide around the middle.","With a better fit, I would have liked it more, but the dress was hidden under my law school graduation cap and gown most of the day so it was fine."
"other","This dress is a gorgeous color, and the style is unique.","I wore this to a bridal shower and got a ton of compliments.","I typically wear a 2 or 4 in dresses (depending on brand) and the XS fit me perfectly, so Id say it runs a little large.","Its also longer than I expected.","Im 59 and it fell right at my knee."
"other","Ran a little larger than expected.","I had a 4 and 6 and to be honest, the 4 was even slightly large.","It looked good all the way zipped up or slightly unzipped in the front."
"other","Loved this dress!","So easy to wear, can dress up or down!","Doesnt wrinkle!!!","Very comfortable!!","!"
"other","Runs a tiny bit big.","I could have worn a size 0 at 551/2 and 125 lbs."
"other","It is very full in the legs so if you are a tall pear shape or athletic build it may fit better.","I am petite but have a large chest, so I need a 6 on top.","The straps were a little long on top, but ok.","The length of the jumpsuit was a little long, but I just cuffed the hem under to keep it clean."
"other","Loved this dress.","Got tons of compliments and people asking where I got it from.","The dress comes with a slip and then you wear the embroidered dress over the top.","The dress is high quality and the details are lovely."
"other","Beautiful flow and movement to this dress.","Perfect color for spring and summer.","Subtle but still a stand-out.","Love it!","Wish I could hang it in my closet permanently."
"other","Perfect fit, nice thick material.","No need for slip."
"other","extremely flattering fit, material was very comfortable and I received may compliments on the dress"
"other","This dress definitely makes a statement!","Youll be the brightest one in the room, thats for sure, but the color is beautiful.","It runs a little short if youre on the taller side.","Also, plan on wearing a strapless bra with it.","All in all, I loved it."
"other","Attached to the lining on the inside is a 4 inch gathered ruffle to give the dress more of a PUFF the only problem is that this interior ruffle is on the itchy side.","But overall the dress was FAB!","i paired with a skinny yellow belt."
"other","This dress felt so great on!","It was really comfortable - Im a sucker for no fuss undergarments so getting to wear a regular bra is a priority for me.","The length was just the right, color beautiful, style classy, and the bonus: pockets, YAY!"
"other","I ordered a small, it runs true to size should have gotten the med, will re-order.","very nice"
"other","So.","Comfortable.","I usually wear an 8, only the 6 was available, so I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.","Fit like a glove without feeling like I was wearing a very little black dress.","When they say curvy should size up, realize its soooo relative.","I wear a 34DD and have about 41 inches around the hip/butt but the 6 was right.","I didnt notice that there is light ruching in the front and back, not a problem but realize its there."
"other","Loved this dress for a fancy, glamorous Halloween costume.","I accessorized with snakes and more snakes, and of course fishnets for an extra-scaly look.","The dress is a bit tricky to get into but pretty comfortable once its on.","I think the XS might have been a better fit as the S felt a bit loose in the waist and arms, but once it was on I didnt feel like going through the hassle of getting out of it and into another one because I was scared of messing up my snake hair.","Very fun dress to wear and I wish I owned it!"
"other","The dress is great for a fall/winter event.","Chic and simple, it drew compliments from friends.","I paired this with blue dorsay pumps and a chunky bracelet.","It appears to run large.","I tried the medium on and was swimming in it.","Just like the picture on the model, there is no shape to the dress, it falls straight down on the body.","However, the picture with the model is misleading.","In the picture, the black sheath is longer than the grey tunic.","When I wore it, the grey and black were the same length, so in my pictures, you only see the grey hem.","You only see the black sheath if someone is looking at you from the side.","I wouldve much preferred the dress to look like it is on the model."
"other","The fit was perfection!","The dress is very comfortable AND flattering.","I hold most of my weight in my hips, so the flare is perfect.","The flare also always stays flared, it didnt fall after sitting then standing multiple times.","Great colors, I received many compliments!"
"other","Super fun cold shoulder top!","The fabric is very stretchy and the top does run true to size.","This works well with any bust size as there is comfortable room in the bust.","A strapless bra should be worn based on the cut of the shirt."
"other","I fell in love with this dress as soon as I tried it on.","This dress is perfect if you have curves and you want to show them off!","The dress runs big so you want to get the size you usually are and a size smaller ,also if you are busty you need to get a bigger size than what you are because the dress becomes smaller at the bust.","The dress is cut low at the breast area so you need to use fashion tape to secure your twins!","Other than that the dress is just perfect."
"other","Was pretty tight up top, but worth it.","Fit nice and snug in all the right places.","Even perked up the ladies which is a plus for a not-so-well-endowed gal.","It was tasteful and perfect for the art museum gala.","Im short, so this length of dress usually dwarfs me a bit, however with 5 heels and the overall tightness of the dress, it worked beautifully.","Highly recommend."
"other","The dress midline hit me at an award place and really made my hips stand out in an unflattering way.","Also the inside material was thick and made it feel like an 80s prom dress."
"other","Loose around the bust area, drags when you walk so make so you have some type of heel on."
"other","I loved this dress!","I wore it to Christmas Eve dinner with my family and got tons of compliments.","The rich green color, and lace keep it from being too boring, and the classic cut flatters any shape."
"other","If youre looking for a form fitting dress to impress, rent this bad boy.","All the other reviews were spot on -- it is tight but sucks you in and emphasizes your curves.","It didnt ride up on me too much like a lot of the other reviews said but it is indeed heavy material... not the best for a mid summers night out dancing because you will get hot - just an FYI.","Perfect for a girls night out... we went to a burlesque show and it was so spot on for the venue.","I wouldnt recommend this for a wedding or family function :)"
"other","#KentuckyOaks is the day before Derby, and  people show up wearing their Sunday best.","This dress was exactly what I had on mind, and the stylist paired it with the perfect piece of jewelry!","I won some cash because I bet money on a horse that won called A Little Bit Sassy - which is exactly how I felt in the dress: sassy, elegant and comfortable.","I was sad that I had to send it back the next day, I really love that dress!"
"other","Received on time, I´m usually size M, but it didn´t fit, so I ordered the L as back up because I´m breastfeeding now and that was the one I wore.","FABULOUS DRESS, everyone just loved it"
"other","I rented this top for anniversary photos with my husband.","I loved it!","Usually, with my large chest, I cant wear tops like this.","If they dont have an amount of stretch, my chest looks like a big blob uni-boob.","That was not an issue with this top!","It fit perfectly - I wish I owned it!"
"other","Rented this to be picked up in the Vegas store, which worked out perfectly because my hotel was next door.","I was able to try it on and choose other dresses in stock - the attached photos were taken in the dressing room.","I loved the romper quality and fit, and thought it was age, weather, and event appropriate (41, winter, celebrating my sisters birthday at a club, respectively).","I am going through breast reconstruction and the romper nicely hid the lopsidedness of my chest.","The V in the front is pretty low so it did need to be taped which made it difficult to use the bathroom.","As a souvenir from the trip, I ordered the romper from the BCBG website so I have it on hand the next time I want to wear it out."
"other","This dress fit wonderful.","I have a larger chest and it still fit awesome.","Very flattering.","Showed my figure well."
"other","I loved the fit of this dress.","It was so flattering!","My usual dress size is a four and the size I am wearing in the photo is a four.","The dress is true to size and fit like a glove.","I do recommend going a size up for curvier women because it was fitted at my hips and waist.","Even through the dress was fitted it was very comfortable throughout my midsection and hips.","The fabric did have some stretch to it.","This dress would work best for any cup size.","I am a 36D and I felt very comfortable in it.","The dress must be worn with a strapless or NuBra because of the razor back.","I am 5’9” and thought the dress was long enough (I am wearing 5.5inch heels in the photo).","I didn’t feel like I needed the long version.","This dress would be perfect for a summer wedding.","Pair with big jewelry and nude heels."
"other","The fit is excellent but it runs slightly small in the chest.","I have a small bust area so it fit me (the side zipper was a little difficult), but if you have a larger bust it might not fit well in smaller sizes.","Otherwise it is perfect!"
"other","I am an Event Planner and wore this for a Food and Wine Tasting that I was running.","Received tons of compliments and it was very comfortable as I had to do a lot of bending at the event.","People said I looked absolutely beautiful.","Loved the lace detail."
"other","This dress was form fitting, fit comfortably and was true to size."
"other","Completely obsessed with this drape slit!","Running true to size, we recommend sizing up for backup.","Although the fabric has no stretch, this piece works great for any cup size with no bra to be necessary.","It is fitted throughout the waist then flares into a full skirt, allowing for a comfortable amount of room for full hips.","The hemline hit me just at knee length.","Pair with tan heels and gold jewelry!","Pair with black heels to your night time event!"
"other","The fabric was soft and the bottom was flowy.","It highlights your waist, which I liked and was a nice length (hitting right above my knee).","It was perfect for the bridal shower I wore it for."
"other","Too large and chunky for a petite body"
"other","I rented this jumpsuit for my birthday dinner and couldnt have picked a better outfit!","It went so well with the ambience of the restaurant.","Im a blogger so I was also able to take some pictures in it as well which was really fun!","I found the fit to be true to size and very comfortable.","Im not tall, but found the length to be perfect once I put on my heels."
"other","I liked this dress even more in my pictures after the event than I did when I stood in the mirror.","Its unique and can look appropriate in a number of different settings IF you account for the super low sides.","Its weird that the dress looks sweet and innocent and then there are these gaping spaces on each side that expose a lot of skin and bra.","A bandeau or camisole is an absolute must."
"other","This dress is such as easy fit!","The empire waist and deep v-neck make it extremely flattering.","I also loved the sequin detail, definitely made the dress really special.","This dress runs pretty true to size, I would recommend sizing down in backup especially if you are smaller.","Overall, you can not go wrong with this gown!"
"other","I really liked this dress.","I wore spank underneath to smooth things out because it does cling a bit;  its that stretchy material but it is forgiving with all that print.","It photographed well and I received a bunch of compliments.","This is one I would have liked to keep!","Definitely plan to wear with a racer-back bra to avoid straps showing."
"other","The pro and con is that the material of the dress is thick.","This meant that it hid and compressed all the lumps of my none too appealing midsection.","It also meant wearing this in humid and hot weather caused a little discomfort, but I didnt mind so much because I looked so good!"
"other","I had read online that it ran small but was not the case.","I am pretty large across the chest so I was worried but it was plenty big.","I would recommend sizing down."
"other","I wore this to a Mardi Gras ball in New Orleans.","I normally wear a size 6.","I ordered a size 8 also just incase because dresses usually fit me tight in the bust area.","I ended up wearing the size 6… it was a little snug at the top but it helped the dress stay up all night while dancing:)  The only con was the zipper was very hard to zip up in the back where the material/fabric changed directions."
"other","I believe the XS would have fit me best but this option was unavailable for this date."
"other","I rented this dress as a back up for a wedding I was attending and ended up wearing it to the rehearsal dinner.","The pattern is really cool and this dress looks amazing on.","The way the pleats are sewn make the skirt stand out a little, so be careful if you are on a second level near a balcony, those below will get a sneak peek!","you have to wear a strapless bra with it, and the fabric is thick, but not hot.","My strapless bra always falls down and I have to yank it back up, but not in this dress, it held everything in place and I felt fantastic wearing it.","Would totally rent it again!","But I think I would get the size 0, the 2 was good but could have been a little more form fitting because the fabric stretches soooo much."
"other","This dress was fun and cute for Easter brunch with family and friends.","Fit true to size, although depending on what you plan to wear it for, it is a little on the shorter side.","I loved the length, but on someone taller (I am only 54) it may be too short."
"other","Overall, I would say the dress fit true to size.","I felt that the dress fit kind of boxy as it was looser than I would have liked around the bust and fairly tight around the hips, which is normal for my body type.","The shoulders were stiff, but overall comfortable.","I found the length to be perfect and exactly how it fit in the picture."
"other","A very cute dress, not fitted at all but the length is short enough that it is still flattering.","Very easy and comfortable.","The color is very pretty and not too bland.","Wore with gold accessories and nude shoes.","I would recommend this dress for a daytime affair - luncheon or wedding or an evening party/dinner but not for a dinner & dancing cocktail event."
"other","I ordered a size 4 and a size 6 just in case.","When I tried on the 4 I could tell it was going to be really tight and it came without a zipper!!","Also, the tulle was not really full.","Luckily the size 6 fit and had a full tulle.","The dress was just a little loose on the waist but luckily my boobs held it up.","It was a great and easy experience.","Next time, RTR  please send a dress that has a zipper.","I got lucky that the 6 fit."
"other","I ordered this dress in both size 6 and an 8 for a garden party themed charity event.","Im usually closer to an 8 but one never knows.","I ended up wearing the 8 which was snug through the chest.","I have a bigger rib cage and shoulders but nothing a little spanx couldnt help.","The length and texture of the dress is great and the color is fabulous.","I received a ton of compliments on it and would definitely wear it again"
"other","I generally wear a sz4 and I ordered a size four and backup size two based on reviews of this dress.","I wound up wearing the two!","Hahah so it was a good day.","The dress is gorgeous and I got many compliments!","Definitely recommend:)"
"other","Unfortunately none of my photos really showcase the dress, but I wore it for my bachlorette party in Key West.","The dress was perfect.","All my girls wore white and I stood out in the colors.","It was a little tight on my tummy, not uncomfortable but I needed a little encouragement to be comfortable.","Also, the colors are a little more muted when you see the dress in person but I could not have asked for a cuter one.","You need a sticky bra for this, the back is completely exposed!","Would rent it again!"
"other","This dress was extremely comfortable.","This designer never has zippers so the fabric is always stretchy and amazing.","It was a smidge big on me, mainly on the skirt underneath.","It was long and big, didnt hug my booty.","(but I am very straight and narrow) I would not wear a bra with this gown, but it can be worn with a strapless.","Definitely would only wear this dress to a formal event."
"other","This was a super cute jumpsuit!","It was a bit longer than I had hoped for, but being a tad shorter than 5 4...it is to be expected with most long styles.","I have a rather large chest so the top was snug while the straps were far too long (I actually had to pin them to make them shorter).","Ideally, it would have been better to wear a size 4 from the waste down, but there was no way the girls would have fit in the top.","The material was lovely & thicker than expected with a double lined top & good enough coverage on the bottom.","Unfortunately, I didnt get to wear this outfit due to terrible rain storms that occurred the night of my event (we all know rain & white dont work well together)"
"other","Ordered this dress for one of my engagement shoot looks.","It was perfect!","The cape is so fun and beautiful in the front and the back.","Material was nice and slightly thick.","Necklace is also RTR.","It was just a little longer than I would have preferred.","Would rent again."
"other","LOVE this dress.","will definitely be renting again.","Received so many compliments.","the pattern looked different in person, but still stunning.","The fit was snug but not tight and the material was flawless."
"other","The dress fit amazing.","There was little difference between the XL and the L. The sequins did not itch what so ever and there is great padding in the dress to protect you from them.","They do however scratch those around you so be ware that is you are in close proximity of others that you may scratch them with the sequin.","Not a problem if your date is wearing a long sleeve shirt.","I was never hot and I wore this outside in Miami.","I was comfortable the entire time and felt great."
"other","Absolutely loved the dress!","I wore it to my Tea Party Bridal Shower and received plenty of compliments and also felt it was perfect for my special day :) However, be prepared, if you have bigger than an A Cup you will have severe side boob showing.","I wore a lace bralette underneath that covered everything and blended nicely with the dress."
"other","I rented this dress for my daughters graduation in early June.","It was an outdoor graduation in Texas, so you never know what weather to expect, we ended up with a cooler night with imminent thunder storms.","The color of the dress was gorgeous!","I loved the tighter fit up top and the flirty flair of the skirt.","I am abundantly blessed in the chest, and it was a little tight, but not uncomfortable.","The thunderstorms did hit right at the end of the ceremony, so there are literally no pictures of me wearing this dress!","I would definitely rent again!","BTW-my daughter and I share this account, my measurements are 52, 50 yrs ago, 38DD, Pear and 150 lbs.","Usually wear a 10/12."
"other","I rented this as a backup for Thanksgiving, but ended up wearing out for dinner with friends the next night.","It is definitely not a Thanksgiving dress :) as it fits snug.","I liked the thicker material for this time of year.","The cut is really cute.","My one complaint is that it fit snug around the hips ( I am curvy, but still it pulled a bit more than I would have liked).","And I dont think I would have gone up a size.","Im between a 6 and 8 and wore the 8.","But the 10 would have been too big Im sure.","This is probably better suited for stick/boyish figures.","But if I had this hanging in my closet, Id still wear it again."
"other","I have a 28in waste and 40in boobs this dress hit all the right curves!"
"other","Stretchy and Sassy!","I chose the long because it was the only one left, wouldve chosen regular if I could (Stepped on the dress) but it was still perfectly fine!"
"other","Such a fun summer color!","I keep referring to this dress as the sherbert dress.","As all Elizabeth and James dresses do, it ran a bit small.","I usually wear either a 0 or 2 in dresses and I wore the 4 in this one.","I would recommend a strapless bra so that the straps dont pop out and show.","You need to wear a tiny thong because the fabric is so light in color that it will show your undergarments.","I am on the smaller side and this dress fell right above my knee.","I wore this with nude heels, you couldnt really get away with any other color shoe."
"other","Only problem i had was the right bra because of the back."
"other","I rented this as my back up and ended up wearing my 1st choice.","Fit well but just not quite as flattering on me as I had hoped.","Loved the color!"
"other","No complaints at all - worked incredibly well with a regular bra, fit like a glove, and was surprisingly comfortable.","I wish I could afford to own this beauty so that I could wear it to all of my bands gigs!"
"other","This wasnt my original dress I ordered because my first one was damaged.","Major props to customer service for getting me this dress!","I wore this dress for my poise/personality competition at my pageant and for the finals.","I was afraid it wasnt going to be long enough, but it was actually longer than I needed it to be!","It was very comfortable for me to walk across the stage.","I would recommend wearing high enough heels so you dont trip on it.","The zipper was a little tricky, but other than that it was fine.","I got lots of compliments those two days!"
"other","This is one of my favorite rentals.","The material is very stretchy and ribbed, so it hides any imperfections.","I was worried that the 6 would be too small, but it felt a bit big actually.","The color is amazing and vibrant.","Only issue is the lining at the top kept coming out of the back.","But it was amazing and Ill get it again!"
"other","I rented this dress for a research presentation.","Every other presenter wore a pant suit but I stood out in a good way.","I was nervous that the v-neck might cut too low but it was the perfect cut, on the length as well!","I added a slim black belt around the waist and paired it with some black heels.","Had to switch to black flats on my flight home but was still comfortable in the dress when traveling."
"other","This was my first time using RTR.","I wore this dress for a vocal jazz show I headlined.","I am 510 and wore 3 heels.","The length of the long was perfect.","I am hourglass/pear shaped and go between an 8 and a 10 regularly.","For dresses like this that are fitted on top and loose on the hips, I am usually an 8.","I ordered my dress late and only a 10 was available but it fit perfectly!","I got a lot of compliments on the color, cut, and fit.","It was a perfect dress.","Very happy with the customer service and will be using RTR again for sure!"
"other","Amazing summer fabric, so light and breathable.","Appears to be linen in person but it isnt.","Could easily wear without a bra if youre small chested.","Love the way the neckline folds over but isnt too constricting.","I am 5 2 and this hit me right around mid thigh.","Would be adorable dressed up with a gold cuff and tan wedges.","Wore like a shift and wasnt fitted anywhere."
"other","I rented this for Back to School Night and loved it so much I decided to wear it the whole day (usually I change from my work clothes before parents come).","I rented an 8 and a 10 and the 8 fit better because the wide skirt left room for my hips.","The 8 did come to me a little wrinkled, but the stripes helped so it wasnt too noticeable.","Sorry for the classroom selfie, but it was all I had for a picture!"
"other","The dress fit like a glove.","I wanted to get the 2nd dress in a size 10 but it was not available.","The sleeve with the lace was a bit tight around the biceps (no stretch or give in the lace).","I even received some sample hair products which I loved!"
"other","Versatile!","Dress it up or down.","Provided a slip, but I used my own.","The details of lace and pleats goes untouched b/c of the color.... beautifully made.","Size down!"
"other","The dress was a little snug around the waste where the black band is.","Other than that it fit well .","The only other thing is if you are short this will most likely be very long on you.","Im 59 and it was longer one me then i expected.","Overall great dress."
"other","It was comfortable and very flattering."
"other","The dress is a beautiful.","Im curvy and this dress accents my body type."
"other","I wore this to my grad school graduation and I am so glad I did.","It is lovely on and the colors are so vibrant.","Got lots of compliments on it.","Fit true to size."
"other","I wore this dress for my engagement pictures.","I love the neckline & fit!","It is more pink in person than it looks in the images shown.","I am 510 and it was a perfect length.","I would have loved to keep it!"
"other","Ok with a lot if women saying this runs big I ordered my regular size 6 and a size 4.","The 4 fit but it also showed all of my bumps and body imperfections.","Maybe if I were going to go clubbing I might have worn it?","Not sure.","But a white dress clubbing sounds scary.","I attended a silent auction/comedy night at our local JCC.","I didnt get any complements but maybe people were shocked I was wearing white before Memorial Day?","Ha.","I loved it, thought I looked great, and was comfie in my black boots and RTR necklace.","Underwear I had on was hose and spanx slip.","But this was well lined I didnt need a slip.","By the way this material is the same material my navy dress uniform was made out if and it was easy to take care of."
"other","Loved the sophistication of this dress.","The structured shape made it great for a work event or cocktail event, while the material was very comfortable and stretchy!","Great with nude heels."
"other","The perfect delicate lace dress to wear to a day time event!","There is a light-weight slip underneath this detailed lace dress, so wearing a nu bra or standard bra is necessary.","The slip is a little fitted at the natural waist but flares out at the hips.","At 54 the dress hit me just above the knee, which I prefer for shorter dresses.","I would wear this dress with pair of black heels and simple earring!"
"other","Overall I really liked the dress, in person.","When looking through photos, I didnt find it that flattering.","This could be because I ordered the 12 (normally I am a 12-14) based on the reviews AND IT WAS HUGE.","I didnt order the extra size because I thought there would be no way a 10 would fit, haha!","I ended up having to pin the dress and pull the wrap extra tight to give myself some shape.","It was very comfortable and I did receive a lot of compliments but I dont know that I would rent this dress again.","Also, I recommend wearing a cami underneath, I found this dress to be very low cut and not how it looks on the model in the photo."
"other","I received the dress a day early and was super excited to try it on.","Both the 2 and the 4 fit but although the 2 first felt a little snug it was the perfect fit as there wasnt extra gathered fabric on the tummy like in the 4.","I am a little on the petite side and I read to wear 4 heels (which suck) and I did but it still was a little long so Id suggest buying some fashion tape and going to your favorite tailor to have them work their magic (temporarily of course).","I kept it simple with the accessories and went for blue nails and earnings.","If you are considering this dress for prom I would go for it.","It is classy and breath of fresh air as I was told.","This dress made me feel so beautiful and the other girls on here are probably not lying when they said that they received compliments all night long because I sure did.","I had an awesome first experience with Rent the Runway and I will definitely use it again in the near future."
"other","Basically, this jacket is hella awesome.","It was perfect to wear while I was out exploring the big Apple.","I received SO many compliments.","I felt like a total rockstar.","Definitely recommend it to anyone!"
"other","Want to say: RTR came through to the fullest!","But I have to say, Ive been having problems with my deliveries.","They have been taken close to 2 weeks to deliver and I have to honestly say, if the same delivering process was going to continue, I was going to write them and tell them that I was going to pass next month (June) of my unlimited payment.","But, before making that decision I wrote customer service first asking, could they rush out my order so my daughter and I (as u will see in my review on her dress) can have our dresses in time for Mothers Day.","Put my order in Tuesday, and Wednesday morning (give or take a few hours), the postman rang bell stating there was a package!","Thanks, RTR!","Im proud of you.","Now on to the Review:It was a good fit.","Even though I usually wear a 4, I decided after reading the reviews, to go up a size.","6RKnowing that my torso is a bit broader, that size fit me better, but was still tight around the hips as well.","The detailing was great!","Length was good too.","As i said often, being a Christian I must represent Christ in my clothing and this Dress allowed me to dress in Modest Apparel  Thanks RTRUntil my Next Review, Stay under His Wings and He will Forever Protect you!","sj"
"other","This dress  is great to wear from day to night.","Whats great about this dress is that you can actual wear any standard bra with it.","It has a enough stretch in that you can move easily.","I would recommend going one size up for back up."
"other","This Parker style adds a formal twist to the everyday casual floral spring maxi!","Running true to size, I would recommend going a size up for your backup, as there really is no stretch to this fabric.","The bust area is pretty fitted, with comfortable room for A to C cup sizes.","Keep in mind that this is a racer back, so I would suggest wearing a strapless bra with this style.","The waist of this style is cinched with a belt, with comfortable room in the midsection.","I would recommend with women with fuller hips consider sizing up, since although the bottom is pretty flowy, it still fits straight up and down.","The straps were very comfortable on my broader shoulders and at 5 7 the 8R hit me right at the floor with 3 inch heels.","This fun floral pattern paired with the fancier fabric makes this maxi perfect for a daytime wedding or guest to your next spring or summer event!"
"other","Fit - it runs a little big but not too big that you will need to change sizes.","The only con is that I wish it had pockets."
"other","Love this dress.","Will rent again.","Fits true to size.","Incredibly flattering."
"other","I love this style and it is definitely something that I would look into renting myself.","The cutouts definitely give it an edge.","The fabric does have some stretch to it and I would say it runs true to size.","For curvier women I would suggest sizing up for the backup size!"
"other","Oh how I loved this dress!","I loved the cut and the lace.","I needed a white dress and I loved that this one was so fabulous.","This dress has no give to it so I cant imagine it being a great fit if you are busty.","Same goes for the arms.","They are all cotton lace with no stretch.","Being tall, I was worried where if it would be too short but it was perfect."
"other","I rented this dress for an event that ran 12+ hours, and it was incredibly comfortable to be in all day/night!","The lace detailing along the neckline is so beautiful that you dont even need a statement necklace with it.","The dress was pretty tight over my bust, which is a DD, but it fit just tight enough that a bra wasnt necessary!","The coloring is excellent on this dress, and youll be sure to stand out amongst a room of little black dresses!","I love a dress with pockets, so that was a nice surprise too!"
"other","I loved the chic simplicity of this long sleeved Tibi dress.","While there is no stretch, I did not have trouble fitting my bust into this style.","There is comfortable room throughout the midsection and natural waist, but is fitted in the hips.","Because of this, I would recommend sizing up if you have larger hips.","The back of the dress has a subtle back cut out and also slits for your elbows.","I do have longer arms, and the elbow cutouts ending up falling above my elbow, but it was not a problem!","At 58 this dress hit about mid-thigh.","I absolutely loved that this dress is like a blank canvas!","You can pair it with a fun statement necklace for a night on the town or keep it simple with some delicate jewelry and nude heels."
"other","this is at least 1 full size too small.","I got an M so I could wear it a bit bigger, and the M fit like an S."
"other","I didnt end up wearing this to the event, but it was a great dress.","I wish I could have rented this in size 6 instead, as I would have been more excited to wear it.","I had a graduation in Flagstaff, AZ in mid-May, and with the weather ever changing from freezing to 70 F, I needed this in my arsenal.","It was slightly scratchy on the inside, but a shirt would have been fine to cover that up.","Overall, although its cute with its florals, this is definitely not a warm spring/summer dress."
"other","I normally wear a 6 or 8 (32DDD, 29 waist, 38 hips; 52) and the 4 was big on me.","It made me look bigger than I really was...","However, it is so festive, very cute.","The sleeves are short (they dont go all the way down to your wrists) and it isnt a heavy jacket.","Not ideal for colder climates."
"other","I ordered the 6 and 8 as I have a large bust.","The 6 was tight through the chest which created the dreaded back fat.","I opted for the 8 which was in better condition and it was perfect.","It downsized the look of my chest (yay!)","and the lace on the capped sleeves made my arms appear thinner (double yay!)","The length is nice for professional occasions."
"other","Overall the fit was great.","I saw some other reviews that the length was too short, but I actually thought it was just fine, long legs and all!","The shoulders are built in a nice way that keeps them up even though the back is fully open.","My only critique is that the fabric of the dress wasnt as nice as I had hoped.","The lace / sparkly overlay tended to come up and show the slip underneath when I was dancing, etc., but it wasnt a deal breaker and the dress still looked great!"
"other","Perfect dress for pear shaped bodies.","I am normally a 4 up top and an 8 on lower half.","The 6 fit too, but was a little too big up top, so I went with the 4, which was a bit tight, but it worked.","I weigh more than my profile says (I have tried changing this, but it wont seem to stick!)"
"other","Everything was perfect"
"other","This dress is not made to be warn with w bra, so be aware of that before you rent it.","The fabric was very comfortable and easy to move around in.","I would most definitely suggest to anyone!"
"other","Beautiful color & not too short."
"other","I always thought I was a size 10 dress I ordered this dress and basically guessed my dress size.","I knew I couldnt be bigger than a 10 or smaller then a 8.","However, I didnt really think the 8 was going to fit.","I wore this to my prom and 3 days before I got an email saying that the size 10 was returned in poor condition and they basically have to throw it out.","Thats the last thing a girl wants to hear 3 days before prom.","So of course I panicked and I panicked.","Thankfully the 8 fit like a glove with still some room, so comfortable as well.","I received compliments all night!!","It was so amazing.","My RTR experience was a little rocky I swore to myself I wouldnt order from here again.","But I love RTR they really helped me a lot they were willing to upgrade me to any available dress no matter the price so I ordered this same dress thats more true gold in a 10 just in case.","Overall, this dress is the bomb diggity.","The only complaint I have is its a little heavy especially if your dancing around all night.","Also this dress is stretchy not what I expected so I see why the 8 fit.","And I have 34DD and a big bum so I definitely think it runs big."
"other","Wore a backless bra, everything looked great, was a little tight sitting down,and some slippage of the straps.","I have a very wide back and larger shoulders, but I was able to zip up the back by myself!","Great color and my first time ordering."
"other","The dress was incredible.","When it first arrived it didnt seen so glamorous on the hanger but it photographed well and was wonderful on.","I wore a size 2 and selected a 4 as the backup but the 2 fit much better.","It was fitting but not as fitted as I would have hoped.","Im not sure if a size 0 would have fit better, but the 2 fit just fine.","I recommend this dress.","I received compliments galore throughout the night.","I have a slightly athletic build with thin hips but a big butt, and it complimented it very well.","I wore this for a gatsby themed law school event and would consider buying!","I highly recommend it for anyone looking to wear it to a fancy event.","Loved it!"
"other","very attractive!"
"other","The dress is stunning and I received tons of compliments.","The fabric is thick and has no stretch so make sure you order the correct size.","The red stripe through the dress is metallic with a touch of orange and the background of the dress is ivory with cobalt blue and navy.","You will not be disappointed!","!"
"other","As soon as I saw this dress I knew it was the one I would wear for my 22nd birthday at the Kentucky Oaks.","I ordered a 4 and a 6, but wish I had gone for an 8.","The 6 was a little tight, but hugged in the right places.","I would definitely wear with a nude strapless.","I wore a black and you couldnt tell unless you were close up.","I still looked and felt great!"
"other","I wore this for my daughters baptism.","Im (almost) 52 and it was an appropriate length for church.","Like other reviewers said the arms are really tight (I went with the 4 instead of the 2 because of this and while I could certainly lose a few pounds, I wouldnt think of myself as someone with big arms).","It was forgiving for my post baby extra weight (Im normally about 118 and struggle to fill a B cup...obviously Im a little off my normal sizing currently) The dress is quite heavy so I wouldnt wear it  in warm weather!!","Pros- gorgeous color, forgiving in the tummy area during all day eatingCons- The skirt was a little full for me and I think the pockets added additional bulk, the lace was a little worn on the edge of the sleeves (nothing anyone but I noticed) and the under layer hung out a few times on my right side."
"other","I rented this dress after my original dress did not fit.","I was going to wear it to a formal affair, but felt it was a little too conservative for that.","Instead I wore this dress to work when I had some important meetings.","I would also consider wearing it to a funeral to be completely honest.","It is a great fit and flare cut, and the fabric is thicker so it does not feel cheap, or clingy.","The cut out makes it fun, and different."
"other","I wore this out for my bachelorette party--loved it!","It was a chilly night in Chicago so the thick material made it perfect-- I didnt have to bring my leather jacket with me.","I am only 5 feet tall so reading all the reviews from others that this dress ran short made it the winner.","Its super comfortable and would definitely recommend it, I wear a 32C bra and went sans a bra for the night.","If you wanted to wear a bra with it I think it may be a little tight in the bust area."
"other","The fabric is beautiful, and the dress is comfortable.","However, it runs really large (wide) and is not fitted.","I felt like I was wearing a 1950s house-dress, complete with pockets.","I have RTR unlimited, so I wore another dress to the bridal shower I attended."
"other","I wore this dress for my bachelorette party.","From the moment I put it on, I felt like a million bucks.","I usually wear a size 10, so I tried both the M and L. Both sizes fit, but the M did more for my curves, so I went with that.","It was great all night.","The length was perfect and the stretch in the fabric made the dress really comfortable.","I agree with some other reviewers about the sequins being scratchy around the underarms, but otherwise, this dress was fantastic!"
"other","I wore this dress to the opening night of the symphony and I felt right in style!","I even had someone I passed on the row getting to my seat stop me to comment on the dress.","I wear between a 2 and a 4 and often wear an XS, but I ordered a S as XS was unavailable.","Im glad I did, because an XS would have been too small.","The dress is fairly heavy and stiff that helps skirt maintain its shape and with the length a petite person may not feel it is the best fit."
"other","The small and the x-small fit the same, except the small had longer sleeves which I didnt like because I would have had to fold them under and the x-small was about an inch shorter in length.","It was probably a tad short on me because I have longer legs and shorter torso.","The dress is kind of thick and warm but since it is February, it was ok.","It was easy to move around in it too because it stretches.","I wore this to my Winter Formal."
"other","This dress fit perfectly...true to size!","The fabric had a nice weight, so it looked and felt great all night!","I received numerous compliments throughout the night.","I highly recommend this dress...the pictures do not do it justice."
"other","Slightly tight in the arms but stretched appropriately."
"other","I wore it for my bridal shower and it was perfect."
"other","I wore this dress to City Hall to make our marriage official before the ceremony.","It was perfect for a occasion, youthful yet classic and classy.","I felt a little Audrey Hepburn-ish.",":) I paired it with a black velvet pump, Helmet Lang blazer with leather sleeves and the Lizzie Fortunato floral clutch, it tied everything together nicely."
"other","I wanted a classy but casual dress to wear to a celebration dinner after racing the Boston Marathon.","I loved the look of this dress online because it was simple, with just enough detail to make it interesting but not too much.","I was nervous to get the 2 but they were out of 0, so I went for it!","It was not a terrible fit but, it was not perfection either (a little too long and large in the bust).","It wasnt enough for me to return or not wear the dress, though!","I loved going out in this beauty.","It was so fun to wear something nice and feel special after all the hard work of training for and running Boston.","I wore it out in a lovely Italian District in the city and got lots of compliments!","I wore it one more time back home in Pittsburgh to dinner with my boyfriend and he loved it!","I would recommend this dress but, if you have a petite frame, definitely size down!","xoxoA"
"other","This dress is gorgeous!","The embroidered flowers are so rich in color, and you can tell this is an expensive, well-made dress.","The bell sleeve is a nice touch, with a bit of a 70s feel.","I originally rented a 6 (34B, 27 waist, 37 hip, athletic build), but it was too big everywhere, and the sleeves were way too long.","This style doesnt have much shape of its own, so even a belt didnt help...there was just too much material.","With Unlimited, I exchanged it for a 4, which was much better, and would probably even order a 2 next time.","I wore it to work with tights and booties, but would not wear it to the office without tights as it would be inappropriately short (Im 55).","I would wear it to a party or wedding with no tights without worrying about the length.","While the dress is very free-flowing from the armpit down, it is very fitted through the shoulder and chest, so might be tight on larger busted ladies.","Im looking forward to renting this again soon!"
"other","I received a ton of compliments on this dress and it looks cute on.","Unfortunately, I had to wear a nude slip (which I had... thank goodness!)","underneath because the panel that lines the bust area wasnt quite long enough and my bra peaked out of the bottom and looked totally obvious.","Otherwise, the dress is cute and very comfortable.","I sized up from my normal M due to lack of stretch, which I was expecting.","That being said, the L was still a touch tight."
"other","I wore this to a First Communion last weekend and found the dress to run very small in some areas and large in others.","The straps were stretched out possibly to prior usage which meant they fell off my shoulders a lot.","the dress was extremely tight in the chest area and while I liked the unusual length of the dress, it is longer than I anticipated.","Additionally, this material wrinkles quite easily as well."
"other","This is a nice, simple blazer and is well made but it just wasnt my style.","The back is cropped and there is no collar to the blazer and ultimately that didnt work on my body because it just didnt hit the right places on my torso.","Might work for girls a bit taller and or skinnier than me."
"other","I have rented this dress in all three colors, and both the small and extra small.","The xs is a little more body hugging while the small was a little more relaxed (but not baggy).","The fabric of this dress is a little heavier than the other two prints and feels very high quality.","Its a smart simple cut that can be very versatile.","I have worn it to work, out to dinner/drinks, and to a wedding.","The paisley is more causal, but the wine colored one could also be versatile depending on the accessories."

"other","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","The fabric was amazing and it really held it all in.","The only thing that kept me from wearing this dress was that it was slightly tight at the armpits and made an odd bulge."
"other","wore this for Christmas Eve.","great dress, fit perfectly, even the sleeves (sleeves are usually too long on me), and it got a lot of compliments.","it obvious does have a plunging neckline, so make sure you have the right bra.","mine didnt fit exactly right and I had to adjust it periodically.","but with the right bra, this dress is stunning.","4 stars instead of 5 because the dress I had was slightly stretched out on one side."
"other","Super cute, comfy, flowy dress!","I wore it for my bridal shower and everyone loved it.","I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!"
"other","Great color, and dress was well cut.","Loved the ruffle on the bottom, really a nice touch.","Able to show off the legs, without looking like thats what youre trying to do.","Give this dress a whirl, its adorable."
"other","So comfortable and great colors!","I loved the style and pattern of the shirt.","It fit true to size.","I would recommend going one size down for backup.","It felt a little loose right under the arm.","The fabric has no stretch but it was loose fitting and comfortable throughout the midsection.","Great for any cup size.","I would recommend wearing a Nubra or strapless because of the off the shoulder.","Overall, fun top that you can make dressy or casual!","Would definitely rent again!","!"
"other","I wore this dress to my rehearsal dinner and it was a big hit!","I was nervous that it would be too short but it was great.","The 2 was loose in my back so I wore the 0 without a bra!","Not much difference in the two sizings in the length.","Its a short dress.","I wouldnt recommend it for church, but it definitely is fun and flirty.","Thanks RTR!"
"other","This is a cute a little shift dress.","Runs a bit large but its okay for this style.","I loved the material and silver accents."
"other","Fit perfect.","Hanger straps kept falling out the back but tape would have helped"
"other","It was a great dress for a curvy girl.","You can wear a regular bra with it.","I thought the sequins might bother my arms all night with rubbing against the dress but it didnt.","It was very comfortable to wear and very flattering."
"other","The skirt can be a bit tight around the hips and rides up a little, and the tops zipper doesnt always stay in place.","Other than that that, the outfit creates a gorgeous hourglass figure and adds a sexy yet classy edge.","I will definitely be renting from RTR again!"
"other","I really loved this dress.","The only downside for me was it was a little tight in the arms and it was a little longer than I would have liked, but Im only 53 so not shocking.","Beside that it was so gorgeous, the perfect color."
"other","Fit perfect!","Perfect dress for #homecoming"
"other","I loved how this dress flowed as I walked.","Extremely easy to move in and the material was very comfortable.","A dress worth owning."

"other","Wore this to church.","Rave compliments."
"other","The dress flairs slightly at the bottom, it would have been more flattering if it hung a little straighter.","It looked nice, just not exactly as I would have liked."
"other","When I received the dresses, I was neverous.","The other dress I choose was beautiful.","I tried it on 1st it was too big.","I almost started to cry but I tried on this one.","It fit perfectly accept the length, Im only 5 and it was long and I was going to wear 3 1/2 heels.","I thought what am I going to do now, I couldnt get an overnight dress it was to late.","I was so disappointed but then I remembered reading what someone else did, they used double sided sticky tape.","So I went to the fabric store got some tape and I was back in business.","This dress is amazing and I danced a lot & ate.","I didnt feel like a stuffed sausage afterwards.","Everyone was asking me where did I get the dress.","I think I was explaining the concept most of the night.","( in between dancing)"
"other","I didnt end up wearing it because it was way too long for me.","Pretty pattern, but it fit weirdly on me."

"other","Beautiful - everyone loved it - but i feel as though it didnt fit me well as a petite woman."
"other","This really is a brilliant blue gown!","Running true to size, we recommend sizing up for back up.","With little stretch to the fabric and tighter around the bust (Im a 34B), this style is better for smaller cup sizes.","If youre curvier, especially in the hips, you may want to consider sizing up for your primary size.","We recommend wearing a NuBra or no bra.","Although it is fitted at natural waist, it does give comfortable room around the midsection.","I could not wait to try this dress on, it is absolutely flattering.","Pair it with black or nude heels and some silver accessories to this stunning piece and youre ready for any formal affair."
"other","The dress fit great!","Wore it to a business formal event.","Got a lot of good comments.","The arms are a bit tight which is a bit constricting but overall, the fit was perfect.","I wish I owned this dress."
"other","I ordered this dress in a size 6, but I have a lot of booty going on (if you know what I mean).","I got the 8 as a back up and thank goodness I did.","It was loose in my bust area and looked a little sad even with my chicken-cutlets (adhesive bra).","I loved the drape of the skirt and the color was everything I wanted.","I think overall the dress wasnt a great fit for my body type.","I would recommend it for women with a slimmer form (or me 5 years ago)."

"other","I love the style of this dress.","Its super elegant and highlights my natural curves!","The gown is true to size; Im 57, around 140 lbs, and have a small bust.","Its fitted throughout, and has no stretch, although it is roomy in the bust area.","Curvier women should go up a size for back up.","I also recommend wearing a strapless bra due to  the sheerness at the top of the gown."
"other","I wore this for my first day at my new job and it was amazing!!","I wore it with tights and boots and a cute jacket but it looked awesome.","Its pretty long and I looked very put together and stylish."
"other","Chest is meant for bigger breasts, so may require a little pinning.","The long is pretty long, but was perfect floor-length."

"other","She is 17 years old and a volleyball player, 6 feet tall approx 160 lbs, definitely a tall athletic build but with a butt.","The dress was just long enough and she wore flats.","It was a little tight in the hips but she was wearing it to be presented at halftime and so she never sat down in it.","It may not be comfortable if you were going to do a lot of sitting.","The halter style neckline definitely calls for your hair to be worn up as you can see in the picture I posted.","This dress would not be good for busty girls as there was not a whole lot of room in the bust.","She wore a strapless bra.","I would definitely use RTR again as it was very easy."
"other","too large, unflattering."
"other","the material is too sheer to wear without a slip"
"other","I was very sad that this dress was just too BIG for me to wear!","However, I dont think I could have gone any smaller because the neckline was very tight.","I had to remove my stud earrings to put on the 34, which was my backup size.","Its a beautiful print, and a neat color and fabric, but the sizing was just too off for me."
"other","I wore this to work with trousers, then changed into jeans to go see a band.","The shirt looked so great with both, and I got a ton of compliments.","It was comfortable and blousy, perfect for tucking in but still forgiving to the tummy area!","I will for sure be renting again!"
"other","I wanted to order the small but it was out of stock, so I got the medium with the XS as a backup.","Ended up wearing the XS because I wanted it to be form fitting.","Since its black and stretchy sweater material, it was very forgiving and flattering.","I think its supposed to hit below the knee which I would prefer but since I wore the XS it came up a little shorter.","Overall, great dress and would even wear it in a work setting but would size up for that."
"other","I went to go wear it and I got a 4 and a size 6.","The size 6 was a little lose, but still too short to wear :-(.","Very Very short with heels for a gala event.","Great for going out."

"other","There is so much to love about this dress!","First, I have to say how pleasantly surprised I was with the material of this dress.","The pictures just dont do it justice!","Its very thick (but lightweight) and much more luxurious in person.","Secondly, the fit is AMAZING!","Between the fitted waist and the slight pleat, it accentuates/hides all the right areas.","Things to note: fabric has no stretch, is very fitted in the waist, but CAN be worn with a standard bra (always a plus!)"
"other","The dress fit like a glove.","I didnt want something too revealing, but the fact that it was strapless and the details on the back made it just sexy enough for my dinner.","You can make this dress as casual or as fancy as you want depending on your shoes and accessories.","I wanted to keep it!"

"other","Fit perfectly very flattering."
"other","I rented this dress for a bridal shower but ended up wearing it out the night before as well.","The medium and large fits were very similar but I went with the large because of the length.","The front of the dress ran a little bit short on the medium.","It was very comfortable and was just the right about of fancy for a bridal shower."
"other","This dress is pretty.","Not for me though.","Its a liiiiitle too conservative.The arms were also uncomfortably snug."
"other","Unusual dress that received compliments."
"other","I couldnt have been happier with this dress and RTRs service.","This dress is a showstopper.","The lace detail is so feminine and the volume of the tulle is just the right amount.","Im 55 and the 2L was just a tad too long (the 2R was sold out--rent early!","), but worked pretty well once I put on 4-inch heels.","It fit like a dream and I didnt have much trouble with the zipper--but just a word to the wise: youll need someone to help you zip up because it is delicate and difficult to do by yourself."
"other","This was the perfect dress to wear to a bridal luncheon on a dreary April in Connecticut.","As many other reviewers have noted, the material is very thick which made it a good selection for a chilly day - this would not work if it were even remotely a warm day!","I paired it with a jacket given the chill in the air.","I am a size 8 in box stores (JCrew, Banana Republic, etc.)","and am usually a 10 in designer.","The 10 fit perfectly and was comfortable.","I loved the pockets which came in handy since I ended up not taking my large day bag and opted for a smaller clutch (not pictured)."
"other","Im right in between an 8 and a 10 right now, which makes life hard.","I went with the 10, which fit(ish) in the hips, but was way too big at my waist.","I bet the 8 would have been perfect.","Aside from the fit and my own miscalculation, I love the pattern and the fabric and would definitely wear this again!"
"other","Dress was for my Bachelorette Party.","Everyone absolutely LOVED it and so did I.","The sleeves are a little tight and its a very tight fit so put it on before you do makeup.","It also seemed a little longer on me than pictured."
"other","I wore this skirt for my bridal shower,  and it truly made me feel beautiful on my special day.","I wanted to wear it tighter on my waist, but it was a little too big.","Other than that, it was a wonderful experience!"
"other","I found that this dress ran small and was not very forgiving!","I am a true 6, and the M was very tight on me.","I wondered if I shouldve ordered a L instead of a S and M!","Furthermore, I wore Spanx shorts underneath it, and the white underlying skirt is so short that sometimes the shorts were visible.","The longer lace skirt on top made it difficult to adjust Spanx/underskirt once they were askew.","But other than that, I loved the look of the dress.","It was perfect for my high tea bridal shower!"
"other","This dress isnt normally my style.","I rented this as a backup because the style I wanted wasnt in stock.","The dress was comfortable and super flattering.","I received lots of compliments on the dress.","Its even great on curvy women!"
"other","I rented this dress for one of my headshot looks for a shoot in San Francisco.","The color was brilliant, but the fit wasnt particularly flattering for my larger bust.","It was strange because it pulled on the top but was really loose in the arms and armpits.","Looking at the model picture now, you can see that theres a kind of wing effect.","Not very flattering for headshots.","I included some outtakes for reference."
"other","Would look great on ladies 5.3 and shorter"
"other","It fit perfectly, was a little long for me (I am 53) but was overall awesome.","Many compliments!!!","!"
"other","I chose this dress for my bridesmaids for my wedding.","Over our bachelorette weekend, I rented it for them to try on for sizing purposes (I obviously HAD to try it on too).","I have to say that this dress flattered each and every one of them.","They are very form fitting but the color looked great with all of their skin tones and was flattering from the small chested to those even more busty.","I would say to size up 1 size from usual dress size and invest in some good spanx!","I highly recommended renting this dress!"
"other","This was a great dress for a client dinner where I didnt want to be too buttoned-up (at Southfork Ranch from Dallas - see photo).","Im standing in a way that makes it look pooched in front -- thats me; not the dress!","The dress was very flattering, comfortable, and cute.","The keyhole neck is fun but not too revealing.","The 8 was a bit loose (comfy for dancing).","Material is heavy ponte so it doesnt tug anywhere.","Would rent again."
"other","Im a D and the chest was way too small with and without a bra.","I thought it would have been more flattering since it was a halter, I ended up having to pose funny in pictures so that it didnt look like I had pancake boobs.","However, the rest of the dress was very comfortable and fit true to size.","I wore this in May so I wish it was a little more breathable but I would wear it again!"
"other","I wore this dress to a retirement party at a museum, so I wanted something conservative, but fun.","This was perfect.","As other reviewers mentioned, this dress runs TIGHT in the chest.","The 4 was a little loose in the waste, but the 2 was too short for my height (the armpits, waste, and hem came up too high on me) and I would have had to smash my chest into the dress and go braless.","Ultimately the 4 was fine, since I ate a big dinner afterwards.","The fabric is high quality, and the print is peppy.","I received lots of compliments, and my sister loved the dress so much, she said she wished she owned it!"
"other","This style runs true to size, works great for any cup size, and is fitted at the natural waist.","It can be worn with a standard bra.","The tulle is beautiful and delicate while adding a feminine touch.","Pair with nude or black heels, keeping the accessories to a minimum."
"other","I am a pear shape so I was worried about the hips fitting and went with a 6 and an 8 as a back up.","I wore the 6 and it fit in the hips but was a little lose on top.","It was a little long because I am very short but it helped that I wore platform heels.","I received tons of compliments all night long.","It was a nice classy dress for an awards ceremony.","Sorry about the photo it was the only I have."
"other","Great dress!","I rented this in the 2 and 4, wore the 2.","Both sizes were a little loose in the bust and shoulder straps for my 32C chest.","No stretch in the fabric.","I wore a thin bandeau liner to keep it from gapping up top and was totally comfortable after adding that.","Could almost wear a regular bra with it but opted for a little more coverage.","The material has a nice weight to it without being hot, it twirls really nicely, and the pockets are definitely a bonus!","The sizes I received had no wear at all in the embroidery,  but a few poky bits of stitching in the 2 just under the waist.","If I was wearing this all day it wouldve been worth adding spanx just to stop the rubbing, but no big deal for the duration of a photoshoot.","Paired this with the Tarte Collections silver metallic leather jacket to dress it down a bit, got tons of compliments on the outfit!","Would rent again."

"other","I wore this dress for my bridal shower, which was a champagne brunch.","I cant tell you how many compliments I received on it!","I think just about every guest told me how beautiful it was.","I am 61 and the dress hit me right at the top/mid-knee, and the waist fell right at the top of my waistline so it created lovely lines.","I normally wear an 8, but I ordered a 6 for my backup size based on comments that the dress runs large.","The 8 was a little large in the tummy area for me, but I ended up wearing it because the 6 was a little too tight across my rib cage (I have large ribs).","The neckline dropped quite low, but for my size 38B bust, it was the perfect little hint of sexy.","For bustier ladies, it might be a bit too much.","I really wish I could have kept this dress, it was just so gorgeous and I felt so pretty on my special day!"
"other","I didnt actually wear this dress -- I wanted to see what it would look like for some fall pictures.","It is lovely and super comfortable.","Its difficult to see in the picture, but the bare neckline is actually nude mesh.","So much safer that way!","I would wear it with a sticky bra... it doesnt need a bra though, if thats your thing.",":-)  Thick fabric and the design definitely make bra-less an option.","To me, this would be a lovely fall wedding attendant dress...the a-line is very flattering and the cinched waist and drop v neck are slimming.","The 4L was perfect for me at 138 and 5 10.",":-)"

"other","This is one of my favorite gowns on the site.","It fits amazingly and gives off a romantic, effortless vibe.","The light dusty pink is perfect for a late spring or summer black-tie event.","It runs true to size, but definitely size up for backup.","The bust runs a bit small and is perfect without a bra or with a NuBra, Luckily the fabric has some stretch, which is helpful with fit!","I would highly recommend renting this gown.","Style it with statement earrings!"
"other","This is a great dress.","I wore it to a bridal shower with a big multi-strand pearl necklace and it was perfect.","I really like Shoshanna dresses because I generally know what size I am and that they will fit me well, and this one did not disappoint."
"other","Form fitting."
"other","This is a great dress, very comfortable and easy to wear.","Im 52 so it was a bit long on me, but still looked cute with heels.","The torso also cuts inward, so there is potential for side boob issues, but I did not encounter any.","I wore this to a graduation and dinner and got a ton of compliments, felt super comfortable and very trendy."
"other","I wore this dress to church for Red Dress Sunday (in honor of heart health awareness) and I do not know how many people stopped me because they admired my dress there were so many.","Its definitely a show stopper although the 16 would have been a better fit (wasnt available) , the 14 wasnt that bad.","It wasnt as short as I thought it was going to be.","It hit right above the knee.","My husband loved it!","Since the dress is a statement piece in itself, I chose to keep the jewelry to a minimum wearing only I-drop earrings and a simple red and gold bracelet."
"other","Wore this for a rehearsal dinner.","It was great for the event itself, but I felt slightly uncomfortable in church due to the low cut nature.","Yes, its covered by mesh, but still was a little more risque than I was completely okay with.","Everything else about it was perfect.","Its a rare combination -- elegant, comfortable, and still sexy."
"other","The hem was a little... wacky.","I noticed there were safety pins in it when the dress arrived.","Maybe to hold the uneven part in place?","I was able to iron the dress to have it lay flatter than it did when it arrived.","Other than the hem issue, I loved the dress!","Unique and definitely made to stand out."
"other","Great Dress for my bachelorette party!","Fabric is thick and good quality.","I usually wear a 4 but it wasnt available so I got a 6 and a 2.","The 2 was ok but tight and we were in 90 degree weather so I opted for the more breathable 6.","Got lots of compliments on it.","Would definitely rent again!"
"other","I rented this dress for my birthday.","The material is thick enough to hide some flaws and the detail around the middle is slimming.","The sleeves were a little long so I had to roll them once.","I would definitely recommend this dress!"
"other","Loved wearing this Lela Rose dress to a benefit auction.","Very comfortable.","The placement of the print really makes for a flattering silhouette.","Princess seams with inverted box pleats at the waistline give the dress a real shape.","Theres a pocket on each side seam.","A comfortable bottom-of-the-knee length on me (Im 56).","Nice touches such as a full lining, strap holders at the shoulder.","The dress is beautifully made and very high quality.","I felt very lady-like and perfectly attired for my event."
"other","I needed a dress for a black tie work event/gala and this worked perfectly.","The original dress I rented wasnt available so this was the back up they sent.","I ended up with the 6P and 4R as my options, and ended up going with the 4R.","The petite sizes in this dress are true petites, with smaller proportions all over.","The 4R was a little long (even with 3 heels) but fit much better in the bodice/torso.","The dress is very pretty and comfortable.","The sparkle on top is very subtle."
"other","I felt like such a star in this dress!","I can’t wait to rent this dress again.","It is a drop waist with heavy layers of ruffles and a side slit.","It runs a bit big, so go down at least one size."
"other","Beautiful dress, but runs large in the bust, which made it unwearable for me."
"other","Fit was very good, but the pockets looked funny (as if they were jutting out) and is quite noticeable if you look closely.","Otherwise, it was a pretty dress and color."

"other","Runs true to size.","This is my second time renting (I wore it to a football tailgate).","It was not too hot and it did not ride up at all.","The first time I rented I wore a 2 and wore it downtown to bars.","This time I wore the 4.","I had to bobby pin the keyhole to not show off my boobs.","But you couldnt tell and it looked wonderful."
"other","I loved this dress even more than I thought I would!","I wore it to an event that was Oscar Red Carpet themed and it was perfect!","I was a little hot in it because it has a heavy liner, but that was actually great!","I didnt feel one itch or scratch from a sequin!","The dress fit well, I loved the way it cinched at the waist, it gave me great shape.","And it was a great length to wear with 3 inch heels.","I am 53.","I have a 32B bust and had to pin the top because I couldnt fill it out and it does have a pretty deep V. But that was an easy fix!","I got so many compliments in this dress!","!"
"other","I rented this dress because I was presenting at a conference.","It fit perfectly and was very comfortable even though I was constantly sitting and standing.","Its a simple dress, but the cut out detail on top makes it fun and flirty without showing too much."
"other","I should have ordered a size smaller, and the fit would have been perfect, but its cut very well and as a busty person it didnt pull or anything.","I also like the single button - it gives it shape while still having a lot of movement.","10/10 would recommend."
"other","Like the the previous reviewers have said, there is no stretch in the top.","It fit me just right in the bust, and there was side boob.","The pants were very stretchy and fit me well.","I liked the romper a ton and it was perfect for the concert that I attended.","I would not wear in a more intimate, family oriented event unless it fully covers your bust area."

"party","I wore this to my best friends bachelorette party, and it was a great fit!","It wasnt too much, and I got many compliments.","It does fit tighter at the top but loose at the waistline down.","I am 510 and the length was pretty good for me."

"party","I would say this dress is true to size if not slightly on the bigger side.","I usually wear a 2 but went with the 0.","It is very bright and fun and made from a fairly thick material.","Best part was that I could wear a normal bra with it and it has pockets so I could discretely carry my phone.","Im only 52 so the dress was more knee length on me than it looks on the model picture.","I would definitely rent it again!","Wore it to a memorial day engagement brunch but it could probably be dressed up more depending on the heel and jewelry you wear with it."
"party","This dress had an effortless beauty to it and it was so comfortable!","I rented the earrings and necklace from RTR as well and added an extra flair to it!","Would definitely rent it again."
"party","LOVE this dress!","Im generally a 4, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for a small.","The dress fit PERFECTLY and was also very flattering.","Im not a huge fan of tight dresses, but the fabric was fairly thick so it sucked everything in and made me feel very comfortable.","Plus, the black cutouts on the shoulders add a little edge.","I paired this dress with the Badgley Mischka Decadent Deco Necklace.","I highly suggest renting it!"
"party","I received this dress after the back up I had been sent wasnt flattering at all.","This is definitely more peachy than orange.","I received some many compliments.","Im very much a pear shape and the chest and arms were big on me but the hips and waist were good.","I would think that if you have a larger chest this would be perfect.","I would definitely recommend this dress."

"party","Pros: bright beautiful color.","elegant off the shoulder.","sophisticated length.","I loved wearing this number !"
"party","This dress is AMAZING!","I received countless compliments about my dress and I WILL rent this again or use it for my Unlimited account.","It was worn it for a surprise birthday party and was perfect.","I rented a 2P and a 4P...I wish i wouldve rented the 0P.","The dress runs a little big.","Being 53, the Petite was still a little long and I needed to wear wedges.","Either way, definitely rent this dress, you wont regret it :)"
"party","The dress fit perfect.","True to size.","I got so many compliments!"
"party","I wore this for my engagement party which was a Derby theme.","Im 510 so I was unsure on the length because most Lilly dresses are about short.","The length was short but I didnt feel uncomfortable or afraid of being exposed at the slightest bit of wind.","I got so many compliments and loved the bright colors!"

"party","The dress ran small and thankfully I read other comments from others and went with the size up.","I dont ever wear dresses and so the underskirt made me nervous to wear and show off a little bit of leg, but the outer skirt layer made it so much more comfortable to wear.","The most snug part was right at the waist, especially when sitting.","My skin is super sensitive to fabrics (textures) and to my surprise nothing rubbed me wrong or caused me to break out.","I loved love loved this dress and felt so beautiful in it.","I would wear it again!","Compliments throughout the night from people I have known for years and people I had just met.","Even the rich, snooty woman at my husbands Christmas party was begging me to tell her where I got it."
"party","This dress fit true to size and worked well with my smaller waist and bust.","The dress rides up a lot, which is why I gave it four stars, but that did not ruin my night out in this great dress!","I got lots of complements all night!!","The fabric is a little heavy, so they dress can become warm if your spending your party inside, but all in all it was a great rental and I loved this dress for my birthday night out!"
"party","Wish I had a photo to show but Im a hourglass, full bust woman.","I am 36 DDD/G, 30, 37 at 5 10 with NO heels on yet!","I wore the 12L for the length that I needed with my heels ( 4 inch ) instead of the 10L.","The 10L fit better and hugged more but I needed the length and the extra room in the 3/4 sleeves because of my broad shoulders.","I wear 10/12 dresses.","I am not petite by far but do have a fit medium build.","This dress was such a success, I have wanted to buy this as a staple LBD ( long or little black dress for a couple a years now, I want!","I want!","I want!",").","You cant go wrong ladies for an event when you want to feel, look or want to be noticed AND be complimented by many!","Its the long version of the classic Breakfast at Tiffanys.","RTR throw me a bone, when can I buy?!?","!"
"party","The eyelash lace on the hem and sleeves was an adorable detail."
"party","I needed a shorter dress to an after party of a formal event.","I was wearing a gown during the formal event, so this dress presented a perfect contrast.","Very classy, very cute, and totally wearable.","The 3 layered folds under the waist line allows room for eating and a slightly bulging belly.","This was important since I had ate a lot during the earlier event.","If you are looking for something summery, simple, yet slightly sexy, this is the dress to pick!"
"party","The dress was a little low cut may need a cami or something to avoid a wardrobe malfunction other than that many compliments was different to wear patterns usually am a solids only.","It was also very comfortable"
"party","Beautiful color!","Loved the lace fabric, very stretchy and comfortable-perfect for dancing..."
"party","Slim fit but not too tight.","54 and wasnt too long on me.","Wore with pasties so I didnt have to worry about a bra."
"party","Though I rented my usual size, 8, the top portion was really tight and looked a little tacky.","I liked the skirt portion, but it didnt look as good with the stiffer top.","This might have been because Im bustier than the average female, but it would have been nice for the material to have more give."
"party","I have a booty, and this actually fit perfectly!","Sometimes short tight dresses hike up around my behind and this did not.","I loved it.","I have larger breasts and this also was perfect.","The material is stretchy and the sequins are just pure fun!!!","Great for any evening or holiday affair!"
"party","I wore this dress with sheer black tights and booties.","It was flattering but covered enough to keep me warm on a cool night."
"party","I got a ton of compliments on this dress and how beautiful I looked.","The gathering in the bust and hips helped to hide the not so flattering parts of my body.","Other reviews I read stated that larger busts wouldnt have much room in the top of the dress, but I had plenty.","Ive lost weight and wasnt really sure of what size I would actually need to wear, so I ordered a 16R and a 18R for fear of it being too tight on my bust, probably could have gone smaller.","Dress does have a slight train and occasionally someone would step on it.","Other than that, I was very pleased!"
"party","I went to the RTR store in Vegas- would have never picked this out online, but I am SO glad I tried it on.","The material is so comfortable, it feels like a lycra suit.","It is stretchy, breathable, and the material is thick enough it contours your body without being clingy to area.","I loved the pattern, would love to own this dress."
"party","I had a laid back birthday party - outdoor dinner at a local pub.","This dress was a great fit.","I thought b/c of the shape of the dress I might need the small for width in the hips.","But the extra small fit much better.","The only thing I would have wanted changed was where the waist hit.","It was a bit low compared to my natural waist.","So the tie wasnt lined up with that seam.","Super nit-picky, I know."
"party","The look of this dress was amazing!","The arms are a little tight so I would size up for your backup.","The color stained my suede wedges, my nail polish, and the backs of my legs!","Be careful what you sit on, and how you sit because of the true all the way up slit it has.","Definitely needs a good steam or two before you wear it and it does wrinkle a little.","I loved this dress over all and would wear again!"
"party","I had been eying this dress for awhile and JUMPED on it on Cyber Monday for my engagement party and I am so glad I did because the original dress I ordered was WAY too short.","It was a gorgeous dress but athletic or broad backed girls beware.","I had to shimmy hard into this dress in order to fit my back into it.","However once I did I was pretty comfortable and felt beautiful the whole night"
"party","Very thick, stretchy fabric.","Form fitting and looked fantastic!!!","Perfect length.","Only con - rides up when you walk, specially if you have long legs!","Overall: absolutely in love!!","!"
"party","I wore this on New Years Eve-- it was wonderful!","I received compliments all night, and I was able to keep my phone and wallet in the pockets and not have to worry about carrying a bag.","I ended up wearing my true size, but I agree that you should size up for the back up size.","Its a little snug around the rib cage, but that makes it extra flattering.","I wore it with a small, gold statement necklace.","Great length!","Two thumbs up!"
"party","The chest area is a little big.","I had to use tape to make sure the girls stayed in."
"party","I loved this dress.","I struggled with the price a bit, but ultimately treated myself as a birthday present and Im so glad I did.","Rented it for a Dirty Thirty celebration in Vegas.","The material is interesting, almost a really tight sweater knit or something and VERY stretchy (Rented the M and L. Wore the M, never even tried on the L so I cant say how different the fit was).","Whatever the fabric is, it kept everything in place, was fitted without being uncomfortably tight, and was fun and flattering.","It does ride up a bit, but on me it got to a certain point (that wasnt creating indecent exposure) then stopped, so I didnt have to pull it down every five seconds.","It was a cooler night in Vegas (60s) and the dress was perfect for walking around outside a little, as well as dancing the night away in the clubs... Not too hot or too cold.","The only down side was that either the texture of the fabric or the arm hole opening (not sure which), protruded just enough to rub the underside of my arm as I swung my arms walking/dancing, and that got a little uncomfortable as the night went on.","Overall, a wonderful dress that made me feel sexy as I celebrated with my girlfriends.","Would definitely recommend to friends and I would happily rent it again."
"party","So I got an 8 and 10 in the dress and the 8 was tiny and short and the 10 was huge and sack like.","I am 57 so the 8 was quite honestly shorter than it should have been, but it was a bachelorette party, so it was ok to be a little out of my comfort zone.","Very fun dress!"
"party","Dress fit true to size.","I loved the pattern and cut - it flattered my larger chest and hourglass figure nicely.","Im 511 and all legs, so the length was really short - I had to be careful when sitting and made sure to have my napkin in my lap at dinner.","If it were 2 inches longer I would definitely rent it again, as it would probably work better for ladies 59 and under."
"party","Only downside- sequins are slightly scratchy under the arms.","Besides that, everything is fabulous.","The small was actually slightly longer than the medium on me (no idea why!)","so I went with the small, which was my back up size originally.","It is form fitting but still comfortable and forgiving.","I wore it with both flats and heels at different points in the night and it looked fabulous."
"party","This dress is my favorite RTR rental to date!","I had never ordered an Elizabeth and James dress and was pretty nervous.","I normally wear an 8 but sized up and ordered the 10 based on other reviews.","It does run small so I ended up wearing the 10 and it was great.","The thick fabric hides any problem areas and the neckline of the dress is super cute.","I got so many compliments and stood out in a sea of dark dresses.","I got so many compliments and my boyfriend told me he wants me to buy the dress!","I would highly recommend!"
"party","I rented this dress for a NYE party.","Perfect sparkle for the occasion.","The dress is very comfortable (minus some sequins rubbing under the arms), and you can wear a regular bra with it.","The cut wasnt the most flattering Ive ever worn, but I still got a lot of compliments."
"party","The fit was amazing!","It thinned me out in the right places and added curves I dont have.","The material was absolutely comfortable, it was thicker material but that made it perfect for a 60 degree evening.","I am 57 and the skirt ended right above my knees, so it was perfect length!","I cant wait to rent another dress again!","Thanks Rent the Runway!"
"party","The neckline on this dress is stunning.","I felt so elegant and classy.","The material feels very expensive, and the cut is very flattering.","On me the skirt length hit just below the knee.","I will rent again.","I might size down next time as it was borderline too roomy."
"party","Very elegant, easy to wear, classy dress.","I wore this to a baby shower and it was lovely.","I had a very thin strap sports bra that actually worked perfectly with the dress since the cut curves in toward the neck.","Wish I owned this dress!","The graduated skirt in the back is very subtle but nice."
"party","This dress fit perfectly, and the ruched sides covered any imperfections.","Really lovely dress."
"party","Very very cute!","Elegant, sexy and super flattering."
"party","I have a booty and thighs, so I needed a dress that would fit my pear shape.","The small amount of stretch was perfect.","The only con is I am a small on top, but needed the medium for my bottom half, therefore, I had to keep pulling up the sleeve as it slid off my shoulder at times.","I was a little worried about the length being too short, but it hit me mid thigh and it was perfect!","I highly recommend this dress!"
"party","i am 59 and dresses like this are usually too short (which is completely unfair because im not even *that* tall).","this one was great.","i wore it with flip flops, which i know is super classy, but ive done the derby in heels before and never, ever, ever again.","this is a gorgeous colour dress, it fit true to size and i loved wearing it.","i dont know if i would rent it again, i didnt love it so much i cant live without it, but thats the point of RTR, to try fun new things that you wouldnt normally buy or want to re-wear all the time, right?"
"party","I wore this to a birthday party.","It was extremely comfortable & flattering.","I got a ton of compliments on this outfit."
"party","The dress fit great, but I didnt like it in person at all.","The bottom is actually a super heavy material that reminded me more of a carpet than a dress.","I couldnt tell from the picture online that it would be like that.","Ive rented from RTR a bunch of times and really love it generally, but not this dress."
"party","I rented this top for my best friends Great Gatsby themed bridal shower.","It was flattering and exactly what I wanted.","I normally wear XL but read in the reviews it ran big, which I found to be true.","I ordered the large and it was truly a perfect fit.","I looked and felt fabulous.","The fabric and quality were fantastic, I would wear this top on any occasion, even to the office.","I would highly recommend."
"party","Stretchy- great for dancing"
"party","I wore this dress for my birthday weekend at the St. Regis in Houston.","I wore it to their afternoon tea, which is beyond fancy and elegant.","And then I chose it again that evening for a birthday dinner.","This dress has a lot of stretch to it and the cut with the ruching is very flattering.","I was just under 140 lbs in these photos, and I feel like the dress was very slimming on me.","I also liked how the dress length was just at my knees.","The off the shoulder dress was worn with a nude strapless bra.","And I wore a nude strappy heel with it."
"party","The dress runs very small!","I normally wear a size 2, but I could barely fit in the size 4.","If you have any boobs and hips, I suggest going up 2 sizes.","Other than the dress running small I loved it!!","I received many compliments on this dress.","I wore it to one of my wedding showers!","I would rent this dress again!",":)"
"party","I sized up because I have athletic arms.","The lace doesnt give much, so unless you have very thin arms, I would size up!","It was a great length and very comfortable!","I would highly recommend this dress!"
"party","I loved this very comfortable look.","It was a great item to wear all day and re-style for an evening.","I got so many compliments.","The XS was tight in the armpits and the waist so I went with the S and work a lace bra-lett under it to cover the neck line.","I would totally rent this again."
"party","I am 60 and 170lbs.","This dress fit comfortably, for my height and weight.","I was able to dress it up with some jewelry!","I loved it!"
"party","Fit like a glove.","Very classy."
"party","Read the reviews that its tight in the bust so ordered up a size.","Very comfortable, cute, flattering for an athletic/narrow-hipped body.","Received many complements for an Easter Egg Hunt party.","Perfect Spring dress.","The front chiffon panels lay flat and are not billowy."
"party","I wanted to love this top, really.","The patterns is neat and but the material is kind of like a scuba suit that lets little air in.","It was a bit heavier than expected and not exactly form fitting.","Fits kind of like a baby doll top so it may be good for those carrying a bun in the oven."
"party","Lots of compliments"
"party","I wore this dress for engagement party.","Absolutely loved this dress.","I usually wear a 10, but ended up wearing the 12 because if fit perfectly.","Very comfortable.","Got so many compliments."
"party","I wore this at a Christmas party that I hosted at home.","It was perfect for the occasion and I got a lot of compliments.","Normally Im bothered by sequins, especially on my arms, but I found this dress to be comfortable.","Both the 4 and the 6 fit, but I went with the 6 because it was less tight and revealing, and felt more appropriate for the party."
"party","The dress was a hit!","I got so many compliments and it fit like a glove!","The length was very flattering as well as the overall shape of the dress."
"party","The sequins are gorgeous and well-done, but my inner arms were raw and red the next morning - dont wear this dress if you need to go sleeveless the next day!","The top is very flattering, but the hips might feel a little wide based on the cut.","This dress is an attention-getter, for sure."
"party","This dress was my top pick based on reviews.","I ordered a M and L.  The day my dress was to arrive, I received a call from RTR letting me know the M would not be coming due to a mishap.","Well, the M was the size I probably was going to need, so they told me to select another dress to have overnighted.","Every option I wanted was unavailable, so I was a little put off by that.","They shouldve contacted me the next day after my order.. not the day before my event!!","I received the size L in this dress and it was very pretty, but not the fit I wanted.","It was loose in the midsection, and not fitted like the M wouldve been on me.","The dress felt good on, wasnt itchy like many reviewers mentioned, it had lining inside.","The dress looked brand new..","I was very impressed by that."
"party","This skirt does run large so I would recommend sizing down for this one.","Its fitted throughout the waist and hips and hit me at the knee.","The skirt is leather in the front but a very stretchy material in the back making it super easy to slip on.","There are no buttons or zippers for closure.","The studs in the front are right on trend and this will be a great piece to start off the weekend."
"party","I tried this on in the Flatiron store, and the XS was a little tight so I rented the small as a backup.","I ended up wearing the XS, but I wore it backwards so the deep V was showing.","It was PERFECT.","I had to use a sticky bra with a clear clip in the front, but it ended up being a really fun, VERY comfortable dress for dancing at my bachelorette party.","The fit is really flattering, and the only thing I didnt like was how it kept riding up, but Im really short and it was kind of long anyway, so it was fine.","Im a big fan of the dress and the neoprene material."
"party","The romper fit like a glove.","I felt like Taylor Swift at the 2014 VMAs.","The open back allows you to show skin without being revealing.","The torso length felt a little tight when I initially put the romper on, but once I was all zipped in I didnt feel like it was tight anymore.","I was able to dance all night.","The length of the shorts was perfect.","My entire butt was covered, and I was no not worried it would show at all.","The material was thick enough that panty lines did not show through.","The back of romper on the shoulder blades is unlined lace.","You will need someone to zip you in and out of this item.","Highly recommend."
"party","I ordered this dress for a birthday party at a country club.","Beautiful fabric and color for a casual yet polished event.","Per other recommendations, I ordered my typical size and size below (6).","I ended up wearing my true size (8) as the 6 was tighter in the hips and took away from the shift design.","To balance out my athletic shape in this dress, I wore a padded bra and spanx thong for extra confidence.","I felt the length was appropriate standing in 2 heels (making me 59) however, the slit on the side of the thighs goes up about an inch so its something to be aware about if you are taller or are sitting down.","Overall, this was a great party dress and fabulous first experience with RTR!"
"party","Fit well, looked great, comfortable and was a fun shirt.","Enjoyed wearing it and would wear it again."
"party","The dress fits very snug.","I ended up wearing the medium.","I got so many compliments on the dress all night!","It was perfect for my wedding rehearsal dinner (my bridesmaids wore green the next day!!",")."
"party","I ordered this dress for a Christmas party.","Ended up wearing my back up as this was a very tight dress (even with Spanx) and I was not comfortable in it.","I wanted it to work because its beautiful and sexy.","A flattering dress for many body types."
"party","Very Flattering - Top part runs large.","I would have liked a size 2 better"
"party","The material provides coverage but is almost light and gauzy while still having some structure.","Love the see through panels on the legs, and the color and design are intricate and flattering.","Love Love Love"
"party","Think material that hugged my body perfectly.","That, plus the color and subtle pattern easily hide any lumps or imperfections.","It was my first time renting so I was nervous, but this was a wonderful experience.","I would rent it again in a heartbeat."
"party","The only annoying bit about this dress is that sequins on skin can be quite irritating, so for the armholes I added a bit of moleskin so it wouldnt irritate my skin."
"party","I wore this out on my birthday and definitely received a lot of compliments, but it fits like a body con dress.","I ordered a 2 with a 4 backup and ended up going with the 4.","It was still too tight, though, because I kinda wanted a looser minidress.","For that I should have gone with a 6.","Another note: I didnt really have a problem with the sequins under my arms, but they hurt the backs of my legs when I was sitting at dinner.","Highly recommend wearing at an event with minimal sitting."
"party","I wore this to a concert in Las Vegas where w had VIP seats.","I felt like I wasnt showing too much skin and still felt sexy in it.","Enjoyed wearing it out!"
"party","The long sleeves work so well for winter gatherings.","The sleeves fit me fine, even though Im short.","A strapless bra is ideal because of the lacy shoulders."
"party","I would have worn a medium if it had been in stock.","The large fit, but I could tell it was loose in some places where it should have fit more snuggly.","I would definitely recommend this dress for future renters."
"party","I ordered 2 sizes, the 14 and the 16, and the 14 fit great.","The fabric was stretchy enough so that I didnt feel constricted.","I dont think the pictures I took are particularly flattering, but I felt good in the dress.","I have ginormous hips and I liked how this dress seemed to give me a nice hourglass shape.","The open back was nice, but you cant wear a regular bra.","My boobs are small enough that I just went braless, but larger chested gals would probably need a NuBra or something like that.","I got lots of compliments and I felt pretty--cant ask for much more than that.","As always, a fantastic experience with RTR and cant wait to rent again."
"party","This dress fit my curves perfectly as well as it did not rise with dancing and movement...","It fits pretty true to size... it fit me like a glove and looked classy!","I would recommend it to any of my fellow sisters with hips and extra junk in the trunk lol"
"party","Loved it."
"party","If I were in my 20s, I would have worn this, but I havent been in my 20s for....a long time.","Great fit, great graphic design, but I needed a few more inches to avoid the look of a woman who isnt aging with grace..."
"party","This dress was perfect for a bridal shower.","It was super flattering, comfortable, and adorable."
"party","It runs a little big.","I wouldve easily worn at least a size smaller."
"party","I really liked this dress!","I wore it for an engagement party for me and my fiance.","It is sheer up top in the back but I was wearing a nude strapless bra so it didnt show.","If you are really conservative or have conservative family you may want a different dress.","The length was perfect and it was fun to wear on a hot August evening.","I would definitely rent again!"
"party","was the right length, which is hard for someone to find when they are only 5-0.","waist hit at just the right point and the darting on the bodice created really nice lines along the torso."
"party","This dress was perfect for my bachelorette party.","The fit of this dress was very awkward though.","The dress was very stretchy.","The medium was pretty baggy on me, especially the top of the dress so it felt a bit odd.","The small was WAY too short and tight so that is why I went with the medium which was longer but a bit baggy.","Everyone loved the dress and was fun to wear I just dont think I would wear it for anything but a bachelorette party."
"party","This dress was super flattering.","Heavier cloth and a little darker in person, which I liked."
"party","Wore this to a graduation party where some where very casual and others a little dressy - perfect in-between with flat silver sandals and a chunky necklace.","Very comfortable on a hot day.","I am up a few pounds so wore the back-up size 8, and did use fashion tape to hold the front together, I am short between chest and shoulders..  My husband thought I looked great!","I would rent this dress again."
"party","It flowed perfectly with my body and was extremely comfortable.","The dress cuts off at a great part of your mid section, making your waist look small but hiding all the unwanted squish.","The bust was a little large, but I had to wear the 4L since the 2R was a little short.","Im 58 so if youre tall, definitely get the L."
"party","The shoulders were a little large so I sized down, but the dress is SHORT!","Loved it though and would definitely rent again."
"party","Older WomenStretchLarge"
"party","I loved wearing this to a cocktail party at an art museum.","Its simple, sexy, and such a fun color to wear.","It does run on the small side so I wore the 12.","It is also ultra fitted and will certainly show everything.","The cut at the neck and shoulders is very flattering; I went without a necklace to show it off.","I paired with super tall orange heels and pearl earrings.","Cant wait to rent again!"
"party","Great dress, lots of compliments :-)  The material is thick and has some stretch, looks beautiful and well-made.","I am a 30F and did not have to wear a bra and the dress did not fall down.","The dress was a little tight across my shoulders as I have broad shoulders in comparison to my waist but I still wore my normal size.","I would get your size and one size up if you are worried."
"party","It fit perfectly!!!","The only issue I had was that the zipper stuck a little bit."
"party","Fit runs small, so order one size up from normal size worn.","The dress itself is figure hugging and flattering.","I love the contemporary design of the dress.","It is modest yet very sexy.","I want to own THIS ONE!","Im in love <3"
"party","I wore this dress to a Christmas Party.","It was very comfortable.","I didnt wear a bra because the back is see-through with the lace.","This was great because I love the look of cut-out dresses but it was also more conservative because the lace is not quite bare skin."
"party","Perfect fit.","The material was quality and the laid on every curve."
"party","Great for a laid-back, spring or summer bridal shower.","It fit true-to-size and the material is very flattering."
"party","I was going to wear this to a cocktail party.","The dress fit, HOWEVER, the zipper is VERY tricky and kept getting stuck on the sequins.","I needed two people to help me get the zipper to stop sticking!","So I decided not to wear it so I could get out of it easily at the end of the night:( I believe the dress I received was a brand new one and hadnt had much wear time."
"party","Fit was true to size.","Fabric was wrinkled, I had to iron it."
"party","Pros:- comfortable- great color- flattering styleCons:- the lining on the sleeves kept showing even when I pushed it back under- the back fit a little big, this dress could have only gotten better if it hugged my back more instead of drooping out - this may have been because of multiple wearers beforehand"
"party","This dress was a lot of fun, and I stood out in a sea of black at my company holiday party.","As a busty girl, I rarely wear backless dresses, but I bought a backless bra and it worked because the dress was structured enough for it to not be an issue.","This is definitely a shift style; the waist was not very defined, which is okay for an apple body type like mine, but it is short so youre showing off your legs!","You probably dont want to wear your highest heels if you are wearing it to an office party as I was.","Would rent again!"
"party","This dress was a great fit and fabric, but it was just kinda blah.","I was looking for something to WOW the crowds and this dress was not it.","I wore something else."
"party","I rented the 4 and it fit perfectly!","I received many complements the entire evening!"
"party","Tie in the back was a little weird, but pretty"
"party","I ordered a 12 and 14 and really both were great.","I ended up going with the 14 because we were going to be out for upwards of 6 hours and I wanted to be sure I was comfortable.","I am a 38DDD and the 12 still fit me, though more snug.","The arms of this dress are lovely, though they dont have much give.","I had more overall flexibility in the 14.","I was thrilled with this renting experience!"
"party","This dress was great for my work holiday party.","It kept me covered, but the very fitted style and metallic sheen made it feel fun and festive!","It is very fitted (even the sleeves zip!","), so the size 4 was plenty small and I typically wear a size 2.","Also, the photo online made it look like it should be worn off the shoulder, but when I put it on the construction looked like it should be on the edge of your shoulders."
"party","This dress is gorgeous!","It has long sleeves but is not heavy.","Great for a cool night.","I did not have to buy a drink all night :) the front comes down low but not low enough where I felt uncomfortable.","I would totally wear this dress again!","And the costumer service was amazingly easy!"
"party","Loved the dress as soon as I opened my box.","Great fit, color was beautiful and very comfortable.","Would definitely rent again."
"party","Wore this for a 1st Communion.","Stylish yet appropriate for church.","Wore a sweater because it still thinks its Winter in Minnesota :(  Zipper was tough to get up past a certain point where the dress changes shape, but just get help and itll go up.","Tight as hell in the bust for me (32D/34C) but I got in and was still comfortable.","TONS of compliments on it.","Great springy colors, preppy cool.",":)"
"party","I dont typically wear anything similar to this so I was a little nervous when I received it and it wasnt quite what I had imagined.","More sequins than expected and a lower cut than I anticipated but I ended up loving it and felt great in it!","Would definitely recommend."
"party","Fit was good on me at top,  a little bag-like throughout, fit my sister better everywhere except the top - was too tight on her there."
"party","Love the fit, very flattering.","Got so many compliments for the bright color and sexy look.","It fits a little smaller so I had to size up.","Overall a great dress and would recommend to friends!"
"party","This is a high-quality top with beautiful details.","Unfortunately, I could not wear my normal size 2, in fact, I could not even zip it up in my shoulder area.","It runs very small, Id say 2 sizes small.","The length is also short, the bottom came to my navel, and the bust panel did not come down far enough to avoid underboob.","So, Id say its great for petite women.","Im 5 ft. 7 in.","120 lb."
"party","This was one of the RTR rentals that Ive received the most compliments on.","I wore it to a party and also to work.","Its conservative enough for work but fun enough for a party.","Size 0R was a perfect fit for me (my usual size is 0).","The dress has a slightly retro or vintage vibe.","It is not a style Id normally go for, but I am glad I did."
"party","The waist cut out rises high under the ribs, which meant I could not wear even a strapless bra, but the dress was snug enough that it was ok.  A sticky bra would have worked."
"party","The fit was a bit large and the way the poof of the skirt occurred was a bit hard to deal with but otherwise, a wonderful, wonderful dress that can be dressed down or classed up depending on the hair and shoes you add to the outfit!"
"party","This dress is comfortable and flattering - I only give it 4 stars because a lot of the lace around the neckline and hem was damaged.","However, also beware of the color!","I thought this dress would be a bright coral or poppy color.","Nope, it is HOT PINK - no undertones of orange at all.","I found the color to be too unsophisticated, and didnt end up wearing the dress."
"party","Perfect white jumper.","Not see through.","I ordered a 6 though I usually swing a 4.","The 6 fit like a glove.","Will def rent this again."
"party","I rented this dress for a casual party and wore it with white canvas slip on sneaks.","It was super comfortable and I would absolutely rent this again!"
"party","I wore this dress to a holiday part and got tons of compliments on it.","It was very comfortable and festive.","Would definitely rent again.","Love the pockets!","!"
"party","I rented this dress for a formal work function and it was absolutely beautiful!","I rented one size larger than I typically wear after reading several reviews and Im glad I did as the size larger fit really well.","The dress was very comfortable and the sleeves stayed up fine without any fabric tape.","I would absolutely rent this dress again!"
"party","I loved this dress.","I have a large chest and it fit in the chest and everywhere else.","It looked really good on, even though I was not sure about it when I just looked out it out of the bag.","I received a lot of compliments and overall it was a great dress."
"party","I rented this for a work event, but unfortnuately, both the size I got and my backup size were too small, and the next size up was unavailable.","The fabric is thick and the dress is well made.","I was bummed that the next size up wasnt available, as this would have been perfect for the event I was attending."
"party","This was a great dress!","It was very flattering and so much fun to wear."
"party","Dont rent this one if you dont have a baby bump!","Id previously rented the Work Around the Clock version of this dress, and it had worked out beautifully.","So, I had high hopes for this dress.","However, the elastic that creates the waist was so stretched out that I ended up having to nip the waist in with safety pins on both sides just to create some shape.","I still ended up feeling like a very colorful rectangle.","Not flattering for an important, on-stage evening.","After re-reading other reviews, I noted that this dress has often been used by mommies-to-be, which explains the waistband.","So, you are expecting, this would be a phenomenal pick.","If not, stay away from this one!"
"party","Pictures really dont do this dress justice; extremely comfortable & great for daytime occasions where lots of eating is involved (it stretches).","I wore it for Cinco de Mayo / my 30th birthday party and couldnt have been happier!"
"party","Fits great, but the fabric bleeds.","Ruined the top of my white leather pants, so dont wear with white unless you dry clean first and scotch guard."
"party"," I wore this for my rehearsal dinner and it was perfect!","It was so elegant and classy.","The fit is pretty true to size, but if you are in between I would recommend sizing up."
"party","This came very wrinkled and required ironing.","I thought it looked cute after that was done but it still wrinkled easily while wearing.","I did receive quite a few compliments on it.","Great dress for not wanting to worry about what youre going to eat!"
"party","Fits true to size.","The zipper is a little hard to zip because the material is thick, just need someone to help.","I loved it so much i think i am going to buy, it was brand new with the tags."
"party","I wore this for new years eve and it was so cute.","It was cold so I styled it with black tights.","I have a large chest and I wore a regular nude bra with it and with my hair down you couldnt even see the straps."
"party","Im IN LOVE with this dress!","Whenever I have a party to go to this will be my first choice!","Its really classy but the cut out gives it more of a modern vibe!","You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress which is great!","If you do have fuller hips, I would recommend sizing up as the fabric does not have any stretch to it.","Spanx should also be worn with this dress!"
"party","This pretty dress didnt disappoint - I loved wearing it at my French-themed afternoon bridal shower and I got non-stop compliments from all of my guests.","Like ladies have mentioned before, it actually has a lot of silver to it, and the textured fabric makes it quite unique.","I wore the 6 (my normal size) and it fit well and was comfortable for the afternoon (bonus - the pockets).","Id highly recommend this for someone looking for a lovely dress for a bridal shower, bachelorette party or rehearsal dinner."
"party","This dress was very figure flattering.","It sucks you in at the stomach the arm material has plenty of room to stretch, not too tight like some long sleeve dresses can be!","The length was great as well for a petite person."
"party","Beautiful and comfortable dress.","Sexy yet not over-exposed."
"party","FIT: Does run slightly large, because Im usually a 4 but the 2 fit best (4 would have been too large).","Bust is roomy enough for larger chests (Im 32D/DD).","It was slightly snug in the bust but not uncomfortably so.","Length was really good on me, but Im short (52) so if youre taller be cognizant of that.","I have muscular shoulders and arms, and the construction of the double cap sleeves gave me full range of motion instead of being too tight, which often happens.","Wore a regular bra and had no problems with the strap showing in the back, even though the back of the dress is cut a little low.","OTHER DETAILS: IT HAS POCKETS!","The fabric was less reptilian in my opinion, as other reviewers have referred to it.","Still a unique fabric that looked and photographed beautifully.","OVERALL: 4/5 only due to it being a little snug in the bust.","Got compliments from almost everyone at the bridal shower and my bride (I was MOH) even joked that I showed her up by looking so good.","People even complimented me more than once.","Clearly it was a huge hit and was very comfortable - I was able to decorate, dance, and run all over the place ensuring everything was going smoothly."
"party","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and I have to say, it was a huge hit with everyone including myself!","I was nervous since this was my first ever rental from RTR, but everything was smooth and easy.","Based on reviews, I ordered my standard size 6 and a backup size 8.","When the dresses arrived, I tried on the 8 first and it did fit well enough that I could have worn it; however, the 6 fit better in my chest area (small-chested) and I chose to wear that size to my shower.","As people have mentioned, it is tight in the arm area if you try to raise your arms above shoulder height, but that was not an issue for me since I wasnt planning on raising my arms for any extended amount of time.","I also was able to wear a strapless bra, and just tucked the back down into the dress--no problem!","Overall: beautiful dress, great fit, TONS of compliments all day long :)"
"party","Received this Jumpsuit Thanksgiving eve for a party that same weekend.","I rented a size SP w/no backup size (which was a risk lol).","I am short and lenght was just perfect.","After i gave birth 2 years ago i havent been much of a shopper since i was unsure of my new size.","This Jumpsuit not only was super flattering, color is just gorgeous, and it provides effortless chic to any event.","LOOOOOOOOVE It!","unfortunately i do not have any full body picture only seating down :-(  BUT i will definitely rent again!"
"party","Its been a week since the party and everyone is still telling me how much they loved this dress.","I am very fair (as you can see), and the vibrant green dress looked great with my skin tone.","Everyone else at the party was wearing a LBD and I stood out...in a great way!","I have large hips and a small chest but the dress fit like a glove.","Sexy, contemporary, & cute.","I never wanted to take it off!"
"party","It was a very pretty dress but it was VERY tight in the arms.","I usually wear a dress size 8 or 10 on the bigger size, but the arms were so tight, I had to go for the 12.","The dress was then bigger every were else like the shoulders and the waist and it was way longer (it fell  below the knee).","It was pretty and comfy, but going to a bigger size because of the arms really threw off my idea of how the dress would fit."
"party","I loved wearing this dress.","It has a nice weight and drape to it and moves beautifully.","I definitely think Ill be renting this one again, but I will probably size down as it seemed a tad big on me."
"party","This jumpsuit was an eye catcher.","The color was great, the fit was perfect.","I got so many compliments on Saturday evening."
"party","This dress seems to run a little small - Im usually an 8 but the 8 seemed tight in the sleeves, and the torso didnt seem long enough to make it up to my shoulders, but the 10 was perfect.","I was ridiculously skeptical of other reviews saying that there is no need to wear a bra with this dress but ITS TRUE!","The dress has built in support - I was so unbelievably comfortable in this dress and I got tons of compliments.","It was a birthday success!","!"
"party","This dress runs very large.","I read the other reviews so I expected that, but knowing how large, I might have ordered 2 sizes down.","I am normally between a 6 and a 4 so I ordered the 4 for my backup and wore it, but it was still a big baggy and long.","It was lovely for a Gatsby party with all the sequins!","The pictures dont show the waistband too well, but there is one--its meant to sort of create a bubble of fabric around your middle--not a look I would go for unless in theme.","I pulled the waistband down for a 20s dropped-waist effect and it was perfect!"
"party","I rented this for NYE.","Both the 2 and the 4 fit, since the fabric stretches, but the 2 was more bodycon and looked club-friendly.","I ended up wearing the 4, since Im not 21 anymore, and we were going out to dinner first.","Id recommend this dress for a night out or bachelorette party."
"party","This dress was super easy to wear.","It might run a little on the large side, but just a bit.","Great summer dress.","And it has pockets!","Its not my favorite pattern, buts its prettier in person than in the picture"
"party","The bust was a little tight, and I think the cut was just a little funny...","But, it was a fun dress and I got a lot of complements on it.","I was surprised that the dress colors werent as vibrant as in the pictures online.","It is a much more subtle print than I expected..."
"party","RtR be careful how you dry clean things!","I loved this skirt but was super bummed to find out that the ruffle part had been ironed down and lay really flat.","Nevertheless I loved this and will rent again."
"party","The fit was a little tight for me around the midsection but runs true to size.","Received several compliments all night and the color was beautiful.","No bra required but did wear spanx and the split wasnt too high on me.","I wore wedges and the length was perfect.","The zipper got stuck on the side and that was my only complaint with the dress."
"party","Gorgeous dress.","I felt like I knocked it out of the park at the event.","I added a coral patent skinny belt and black patent heels to finish the outfit.","I think it made a huge difference in the look.","Keep in mind that the sleeves are very tight (at least they were for me) and I noticed a little tearing in the sleeves from past rentals.","Still, it was worth it for me.","I heard lots of compliments from other ladies at the event and felt very confident while posing for the cameras.","This dress felt perfectly appropriate for an event with lots of older, conservatively dressed ladies.","It felt respectful without compromising style.","The only eyebrows I raised were the ones who came up to compliment me on my dress choice.","Highly recommended."
"party","This was a fabulous piece to wear to my sons party.","What a hit!","If I could afford it, I would buy this dress."
"party","This dress like most Herve, fits like a glove.","They are true to size.","This one is newer than other Herve that are older, so you may want to go up a size for fit."
"party","Wore this to a party where the theme was summer elegance and it was perfect!","Lots of compliments.","Snug fit and gave me a cleavage which I never have - loved that part!!","It was great to wear and can be dressed up with fab heels and jewelry or down with flat sandals and a tan bag."
"party","The dress was a little tighter than I was expecting, but I still loved wearing it!","It fit tighter around my hips because I have a pear body shape.","It was not too scratchy, I would recommend this dress to anyone!"
"party","This dress fabric is very structured... Love the look of it!","Everyone loved it!!!!!","Great fun dress"
"party","This ran way too large for my bottom and was too small for my top - it was a bit awkward - I didnt order it but RTR did give me a credit and offered to overnight me a replacement or ship me a smaller size unfortunately it wouldnt have worked smaller or larger."
"party","This dress has so much potential- but the four (my go-to-size) fit much more like a two- especially in the shoulders, which were so tight it actually left a red welt when I tried it on.","I dont have particularly broad shoulders, so this was a surprise.","Although I believe that at times one must suffer to be beautiful, I dont want to be uncomfortable all evening in an all-fitting dress, so I returned it for credit.","So size up, and if you do, you wont be disappointed- the dress shape is flattering, the sleeves are so lovely and drape beautifully, and the dress fabric is nicely lined."
"party","Runs big so I sized down based on other reviews.","Probably couldnt have gone smaller in the shoulders but could have fit another person or hidden a big baby bump in the rest of it :)"
"party","I suggest getting a size that is a little smaller.","I tried on a small at the store and it fit well but was a little snug but bearable.","In the end, I ordered a medium and it did not work out well.","It looked nice but the straps were falling down from time to time and the dress stretched out where I was constantly picking up and making sure everything was covered.","Beautiful fit but definitely should have ordered a small.","This designers dresses stretch females."
"party","I loved this dress for my bachelorette party, it was beyond perfect!!!!","would rent again in a second!"
"party","I wore this for a New Years Eve party, and it fit the occasion perfectly.","I got a ton of compliments throughout the night, and I was very comfortable the whole time.","The cut is flattering and creates a very feminine silhouette.","I felt like the sequins could make it glam or playful, so you can have a lot of fun accessorizing your look.","I would definitely recommend it!"
"party","I wore this for my rehearsal dinner with opaque tights and heels.","The dress is a great, thick cotton material and the sweatshirt-like lining is very comfortable.","The thicker material helps mask any unwanted bumps along your waist.","Im 55 and typically wear a size 6, but the size 4 fit better in order for it to have a slightly tigher fit.","It was very short, though."
"party","The neckline is a little plunging but liberal to accommodate a full bust.","True to size everywhere else."
"party","Wore styled for a baby shower with a button up top; also to work with a sweaterDidnt expect the vents and larger cut-outs, so had to adjust"
"party","Love this dress!","The colors are really sophisticated and the fit is really sexy without being too revealing.","Ive worn Herve Leger before and Im ALWAYS an XS, but the XS in this dress was super tight (especially around the girls).","I almost couldnt get it zipped.","It worked out, but I might have gone with a S if it was available."
"party","Wore this to a holiday party and it was amazing.","This dress is all about the boobs and the glitter!","Very forgiving in the hips and midsection and makes everything look amazing.","True to size for a 6 with absolutely no discomfort due to sequins."
"party","Loved this shirt!"
"party","The color of this dress was striking in person!","Definitely a stand out!","It was so comfortable and great for anyone trying to camouflage a tummy.","If you have great legs, this definitely shows them off!","Loved it and would rent it again in a heartbeat!"
"party","I rented this dress for my husbands company holiday party and it was perfect!","I will definitely rent this dress again for other occasions.","I loved this dress so much, I didnt want to return it!","The print was beautiful, the fabric felt high quality and the colors were vibrant.","I thought the dress fit well, and you could wear a regular bra.","The hemline was interesting and I think helped the longer length work on a shorter person."
"party","I rented this for my nieces bachelorette dinner; I wore the s, XS was much too snug.","Great cutout details, flattering fit!","I did not wear a bra, the fit and fabric allow you to get away with no bra.","Loved this dress."
"party","Im 55 and 210lbs and the 14W fit me well and was a little loose.","I do run smaller in the bust area though so my more endowed sisters may want to go up a size.","The detailing was beautiful and I received a number of complements on the dress throughout the night.","It was perfect for the Winter Whiteout themed launch party I was attending.","It was a little see-through if you wore anything other than nude undergarments though."
"party","I ordered the dress based on chest proportions as it is the only part of the dress that actually hugs tight.","I usually wear a size 4-6 but here I ordered 8 and 10 just to be safe.","10 was way too big, and 8 fit perfect.","The dress was very comfortable and the pockets were a PLUS.","Got sooo many compliments and everyone loved it!"
"party","I love this jacket.","It wasnt too bulky, provided ample warmth, and added much class and sophistication to my entire outfit.","I would rent this one again!"
"party","One thing I didnt notice is the area where the buttons are has a slight gap where you will show a sliver of skin.","I decided it didnt bother me though.","Also, I have a slightly longer than average torso for someone my height.","Even with the long size, I would have been in trouble if my torso were one inch longer.","The fit was roomy in the bust and rear end but not unflatteringly so.","I got lots of compliments and really enjoyed wearing it!"
"party","While I wouldnt say this dress runs small, it definitely doesnt hide anything.","I loved this dress for my bachelorette party -- the fit and cut out still make it super flirty and fun."
"party","It ran small in the waist and the straps to the lining were oddly long and drooped off my shoulders.","Had to have another dress overnighted for my party.","Just didnt work- I usually wear a 12 and even the 14 was too small!","!"
"party","Love this dress for cold weather!","Even a small was not as tight as I expected.","I was afraid the arms would be tight becuase mine are a bit musclar, but the material is lacey and stretchy so it fit no problem!","Love the open back, definitely need an adhesive (or no) bra!"
"party","I loved wearing this jumpsuit.","It was elegant, comfortable and and fits perfectly.","I would definitely rent again."
"party","This dress was super sliming and hugged in all the right places.","I wore this for a Christmas party and the heavier material was perfect for cooler weather, but not too heavy."
"party","Dress fit very well.","Love the pockets!","Slight side boob which made the dress a bit sexier than I was expecting but I was very happy with the overall look."
"party","Im 58 and this was too short for me, and the waist line basically highlights love handles.","Didnt wear it!"
"party","This dress was absolutely GORGEOUS.","It fit like a glove, the colors are perfect (just the right amount of sparkle), and the open back is stunning.","Very classy dress.","I received so many compliments.","I honestly want to purchase this dress - and plan on doing so!"
"party","No cons this dress was a huge hit!","Perfect little black dress you can fancy up or casual down."
"party","Love this brand this is the second time Ive worn it and it always fits perfect.","I got so many compliments, i normally wear black but this color was perfect because it was dark but still great for spring/summer!"
"party","I really liked the fit of this dress but I suspect it may be tight and awkward if top heavy."
"party","I just adored this item - wish I could own it.","I added a sophisticated elegance!"
"party","I enjoyed wearing this romper and found that it was easy to get in and out of it.","The additional snap closure in front was helpful in hiding my bra and allowing me to lean over with ease.","I thought that the romper cinched my waste nicely and was loose around my mid-section allowing me to move freely.","I would own this if I could!"
"party","Fit wonderfully and very comfortable.","I am 54 and it hit my knee exactly."
"party","It has pockets!","I was able to carry my phone, lipstick and IDs without affecting the look, major win.","The fit was exactly what I was hoping for, I did not even try on the other two dresses.","I paired it with black tights and booties for comfort, but I could have also done strappy shoes to step it up a notch.","I would absolutely recommend this dress."
"party","Fits true to size.","Im only 52 and short-waisted so the material bunched a bit at the waist but because the dress is black, its not as noticeable.","I received many compliments on the gold accents at the bottom!"
"party","I rented this for a Xmas party for work.","The dress was pretty but ran small.","I usually wear a 4 but wore a 6 in this dress and it was still on the tight side.","There was a large hole in the lace of the sleeve that was really noticeable...had to get creative to hide that since I couldnt wear the other size dress.","As others have stated it is short..I worn opaque tights under mine.","If you will be doing a lot of sitting, make sure you are prepared with something for on your lap.","Luckily I had a napkin for dinner to cover how high it rode up.","The shipping procedure was great!"
"party","Im so happy I ordered the XS as a back-up because S was much too big.","The sequins unfortunately scratch the underarms.","Other than that, I stood out despite sequins being a major trend this year!","People were complimenting me because they really thought I looked good, not just to be courteous.",":)"
"party","Great fit, true to size, nice fabric"
"party","The color is adorable, and the cut of the body of the dress is very cute.","However, the top portion makes the dress completely unwearable.","The straps are incredibly awkward, making the armpit region look very chubby.","Also, even with a modest 34B bust, there is a lot of potential for sideboob (not the tasteful kind) in this dress, given that the straps are overly long.","I ended up having to wear a different dress."
"party","I ordered a size up after reading some of the reviews on this dress but I wish I hadnt.","The 2 was pretty loose on me but I still really enjoyed the dress and received many compliments."
"party","I wore this jumper for a party my company was hosting and I was working at.","It was the perfect mix of fun and professional - I got tons of compliments and was happy to have something to wear that wasnt the standard LBD.","My only complaint was that the pleating in the front of the pants can be slightly baggy and thus unflattering at certain angles.","But overall I loved this and would definitely rent again."
"party","This skirt does run slightly large, so for a fit at the natural waist i would size down.","As some reviewers mentioned, it is very see through so a slip is necessary!","I wore a cropped sweater, but I imagine the sheer fabric would have made a tucked in shirt tough.","That said - fantastic skirt and absolutely perfect for a special occasion!"
"party","I wear a 14 or a 16, this one was a 16W.","It was roomier, but not in a bad way.","I liked the fit.","I felt very comfortable in it.","I dont usually wear tight-to-the-body dresses, but since this one had a cape, I felt I could pull it off.","I hadnt gotten so many compliments on my outfit in a while.","Very nice dress."
"party","The fit was perfect except for the length - the body was a bit too short and the legs needed one to two more inches to truly fit.","Everything else about this jumpsuit was super fun, flattering, and comfortable.","My underarms were a bit scratched up the next day, but I didnt even notice the night-of."
"party","I truly enjoyed wearing this dress.","I received many compliments all night long.","The fit is true to size.","I wore the size 2 which was just slightly larger than I would have liked, the size 0 was definitely the better option for me.","Unfortunately when I received the dresses the size 0 no longer had the bright white look to it as the size 2 option.","I wore the dress to an all white party and did not want the dress to grey in the photos when I stood next to people who were wearing true white clothing.","I give this dress a five start rating because of all of the compliments that I received.","If the other guests thought I looked great in the dress (which I thought couldve been a little better fitted for me) then the dress was a success!"
"party","This was a great fit.","Stretchy.","Little uncomfortable under the arms with the sequins after awhile but I wore it for hours."
"party","Another awesome Herve!","Perfect fit and so many compliments.","Why buy when you can rent!"
"party","I LOVED how this dress fit.","It wasnt tight and hung perfectly.","Everyone commented on how pretty it was and the cool sleeves.","I will probably rent this exact same dress again if I have another event.","I loved it that much!"
"party","I rented this as my backup and ended up wearing it.","It was a little snug in the chest but otherwise fit true to size.","I got a ton of compliments."
"party","The dress was a little snug up top for me.","Still loved the dress..very classy and fun for a holiday party.","Received many compliments and would rent it again."
"party","This dress is a true stunner.","I got so many compliments!","I didnt wear a bra with it, and being someone with a rather large bust that is not the normal.","A little hard to zip up but once my hubby put some muscle behind it, it fit like a glove."
"party","I rented this for a baby shower in January at the Junior League building.","It was SO comfortable and a nice, thick fabric, so it was perfect for the weather.","Super flattering cut and it fell mid-thigh when seated.","The skirt was full, but it wasnt bubbly or overwhelming at all.","I actually preferred the fuller skirt as I have a big butt, but this dress didnt make it seem as big which was appreciated.","No complaints at all, I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"party","I loved this dress!","It fit perfectly and ran true to size.","I did have a little trouble hiding the very tops of my strapless bra cups under the illusion, but I managed to make it work.","The dress was very comfortable and I like the color, though I felt like it was darker blue than how the dress looks online."
"party","Dress runs very small.","I am usually a 14/16 - I ordered this as a backup dress in size 18 thinking it would work considering others had commented on how small it runs.","I was able to wear the dress but it was not comfortable at all.","The sleeves were way too tight and there was hardly any stretch to them.","Its a beautiful dress but was ultimately a complete waste of $$."
"party","I ordered the 6 and a backup size of 4 after reading reviews that it may run a tad large.","(I sometimes wear a 6 due to full bust).","I wore the 4, and it was perfection.","A stick-on bra worked great for the backless effect.","Got lots of compliments, and it was exactly the look I was after for my sons engagement party.","I absolutely loved the conservative lace front with a high neck but the backless diamond when viewed from behind.","Extremely classy but also sexy.","Would definitely rent again.","LOVE LOVEthis dress!"
"party","I love capes and this was no exception.","I needed some fabric tape to make the non-caped side stay up, and the color was a bit darker and less vibrant than it looked online.","I thought it ran quite small and I had to size up.","The fabric was a bit clingy and spanx underneath definitely help the dress flow a bit more.","All in all, a great dress to stand apart from the crowd in."
"party","The dress was awesome.","Im small chested and didnt need to wear a sticky bra bc the dress was thick enough and busy enough.","My torso may be a bit longer than the 2 was made for.","The dress rode up a bit as I walked but it was worth the rental."
"party","Sleeves were a bit scratchy.","Red lipstick and black eyeliner balanced out the flash of it.","I wear a Gap/Old Navy XS and the small fit perfectly."
"party","Wore this to my bachelorette party - fun color and comfortable fit.","A bit longer than it appears on the model."
"party","Loved this dress!","It was a little shorter than I initially thought it would be but it was a ton of fun for our Christmas party at a local casino.","I loved the color and the underlayer.","The dress fit great and was true to size."
"party","I received many compliments on this dress.","It runs true to size and was very comfortable.","I wore with brown leather sandals and some Kendra Scott earrings."
"party","Fit nicely especially for a petite person - could easily dress it up or down with shoes and accessories."
"party","I absolutely loved this dress.","Great fit.","I wore it a bit more form fitting which was different from the stock photo but I loved it.","The fabric is not forgiving and had to find the right seamless undergarments for this dress but I love it and it was a show stopper.","Would rent again."
"party","This dress is very flattering.","The only con was it was too long to wear with flat sandals as I had wanted too.","I am 54 and had to wear wedges, which wasnt the look I was going for..."
"party","Couldnt wear this dress as it was cut  bit small, especially in the ribs area.","Also, the fit notes indicate that it is knee length on a 56 model; Im 57 and it was no where near knee length, more mid thigh.","Wanted to wear this to my friends rehearsal dinner but there was no room to breath or eat in the dress.","Wasnt able to get a 2nd size in the dress so dont know if larger size would have helped."
"party","I am typically a size 4.","It was not available for the dates I chose, so I took a chance and ordered the 2 without a backup style.","Even the 2 ran a little baggy in the midsection, but that can be expected from a shift style dress.","I am 53 and I was very aware throughout the night that I could not bend over in this dress.","Other than that, it was very comfortable and the color was perfect for a late summer rehearsal dinner for a wedding that I was in.","I would rent this dress again."
"party","I loved the overall fit of the jumpsuit.","I am 59 and rented the regular length which was a little too short for my liking.","I would rent the long length next time."
"party","Dress was easy to wear, had a nice weight to it with full sequin beading, very tight weave to the sequins so it really sparkles.","Maybe its my baby skin but the sequins did tend to rub around the arm holes towards the end of the night, but not enough of an annoyance not to rent this one again."
"party","Runs small.","I could have fit my usual size since theres a bit of stretch, but it looked much better a size up.","Its slightly body con, so very flattering for someone with some hips."
"party","I can see this dress fitting all shapes and sizes.","The only con is if you wear your hair down the sequins will grub it and poof it.","I looked like Diana Ross by the end of the night.","It wasnt too bad tho."
"party","Fit was overall good.","At the wrist it was tight, belly area was loose and bunched up a bit.","Little itchy at first but got used to it.","Word of really good advice...DO NOT wear your hair down, it gets caught on the dress a lot!","Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only cause I saw two other girls wearing it too."
"party","From the front I loved the way this looked on me, but I had the bottom-of-zipper  bump that some other reviews mentioned.","Kind of  resembled a tail  so not what I was going for given the party was more of a standing one.","I only tried one size via Unlimited  -- which I found TTS -- but others said sizing up helped the tail.","I may try that and hope its not too much fabric elsewhere."
"party","I loved this dress so comfortable!","it was perfect for my birthday!","I suggest wearing some sort of strappy shoe with it"
"party","Striking color combo and design.","Tons of compliments"
"party","I wore this to my winter engagement party and got so many compliments, from random strangers and friends!","It is quite sparkly in person and it is a real stand out dress!","The back is low and gives it a little bit of sexiness and skin with the conservative neckline and long sleeves.","Form fitting and not too short - good for tall girls!","I did feel like the sleeves could have been tighter.","The small almost fit me too - not a huge difference in size.","I went with the medium because I have a long torso and it did not feel like it was pulling as much from shoulder to back."
"party","This dress runs extremely small Im usually a 4, but couldnt move in it.","The 6 fit but even still was little snug in some places.","I got a lot of compliments.","The lace makes it stand out from other black dresses.","I paired this nude pumps and pearls."
"party","Rented this for new years eve to add some fun to my outfit.","Wore it with black pants and a black top with a statement necklace and it was amazing.","Got so many compliments...the bartender even put it on cuz he loved it.","Only sent it back to make room in my luggage.","Will definitely be renting this one again"
"party","The 6R had the length I needed because the 4R was a bit too short.","The only problem I had was I couldnt wear a bra and it is a little loose so you have to keep aware not to show your stick on bra."
"party","This dress fit my curves very well.","I usually have trouble with dresses going past my hips, but this dress was beautiful and fun.","I received a lot of compliments and made my engagement party unforgettable."
"party","This was so pretty, but I ended up not wearing it :(  Im 59 and the torso just wasnt quite long enough, I would have been adjusting the crotch all day.","The shorts also came up very high when I sat.","The fabric has no stretch."
"party","Fit very well!","Ive got a long torso so it was a bit short in the waist but still fit nicely and looked cute.","Im not very busty, so I used a stick-on bra.","Hit a little above the knee, did not look as short on me as it does on the model."
"party","Rented this for a girls dinner.","Super cute, worn as a dress with black tights, fit loose but not in an overwhelming way.","Fur sleeves were fab.","Would go with your normal size, because the body fit is loose but the neck is super tight.","Cons: very warm, hard to fit in jacket sleeves, and neck is VERY tight - uncomfortably so.","Also, arrived with very strong cleaning smell.","Would consider renting again, but neck was just a little too much for me."
"party","I wore this to my friends bachelorette party and it was the perfect material for just-before-fall weather as it was thicker.","My only issue was that it was so short that I was pretty self conscious all night."
"party","There arent many semi formal situations these days where a gal can wear a white dress!","This one was work party appropriate but also fun and modern.","I found that it actually ran a touch large and the 6 would have been too baggy.","Got compliments all night long!!!","!"
"party","Definitely on the smaller size and quite short.","Go up a size if you are unsure!"
"party","Really loved this dress, I wore it to a formal holiday party - due to my body type I was afraid that the dress would be loose in the top and too tight in the bottom.","Fortunately it fit great in all areas!","I have a small bust size so I was able to wear this dress without a bra and still felt comfortable.","I wore 3 inch nude heels and the dress fell right to my feet.","Easy to move around in.","My only complaint was that the pockets were visible under the dress but it was not very noticeable.","I received so many compliments all night!","Would definitely recommend this dress!"
"party","very large, order 1 or 2 sizes down"
"party","-Wrap detail covered problem area in midsection -Quite short, found myself tugging it down throughout the night, but I think its pictured that way so I cant complain!","-Overall felt very confident wearing this"
"party","This dress was perfect for my winter bridal shower, I got so many compliments and my fiance was ga-ga over it (which is rare).","The under skirt actually has tulle which makes it stand up, I was not expecting it and it could be itchy but overall it wasnt a huge deal.","I did think it was a little tight across the back, I kept feeling like I was going to Hulk out when I lifted both my arms, maybe a size up would have fixed that?"
"party","Such a lovely, flowy dress.","I felt really comfortable and would definitely rent this again!","The hooks/buttons in the front and back dont close it up completely, there are little gaps in between.","I wore a black strapless lace bra underneath to cover everything and that worked great.","The smallest part of the dress is right under the bust and is not stretchy at all, so if you have a wider ribcage you might want to size up.","Id recommend this dress for sure!"
"party","It fits extremely well.","I recommend it for an hourglass body type.","You definitely need to be busty to fill it out.","The support is great I didnt even need to wear a bra!","Love, love this dress!"
"party","It fit well, and was comfortable."
"party","While this jumper was cute and comfortable, the waist area bulged oddly (there is a flap sort of thing?)","and made me look bigger waisted than I am.","I decided not to wear it."
"party","I loved the back of this dress and the sequin details, but the fitting was not as flattering as I would have liked it to be around my midsection.","The size 2 ran a little bit big around the midsection and waistline."
"party","Fit was perfect and loved the see-through of the botton of the dress.","Felt flirty."
"party","A little baggy on the waist.","Nice to have zippers on the sleeves."
"party","I rented this dress for a baby shower.","Its gorgeous!","The only issue I had was the slip riding up occasionally, but I had to wear pantyhose since spring hasnt arrived in NY yet.","Im 57 and 165 pounds with an curvy/athletic build and the medium fit perfectly, since the material holds everything in.","The dress was a little tight on the arms but nothing crazy.","I didnt want to send it back!"
"party","It fits great.","It is a little short so be prepared!"
"party","The dress was nice, not my favorite, but not bad.","The top has some funky colors, which is nice, but the dress really hugs.","It showed more of my unpleasant curves than I would have wanted, but it was still fun for the occasion."
"party","I wore this dress for my reherseal party for our wedding and it was absolutely perfect!","The fit was great, very true to size, thick material and fit right to my body.","The color was beautiful blush color and would recommend for wedding, or formal party.","Loved this dress!","!"
"party","I am heavier around the middle..","The fabric hugged that area more than i would have liked."
"party","This dress is gorgeous!","Beautiful color and good, thick material.","The only thing I would say is that it runs a bit on the small side and the material is not forgiving if its too small.","I usually wear a 2 or 4 (32 C cup, 26 waist), but ordered a 6 based on other reviews.","Im glad I did because it fit just right!","Would highly recommend :)"
"party","This jumpsuit is awesome.","The fit is very flattering, especially for someone with a larger bust like me.","I also have a long torso, which makes rompers/jumpsuits often ill-fitting, but this one was awesome.","The length of the pants portion was perfect.","The only downside was going to the restroom in this outfit is a little tricky."
"party","I did wear a black camisole underneath because of the side slits.","Paired it with black pants."
"party","This was my first rtr and this dress was amazing!","It is large on the top but nothing a little fashion tape cant fix!","I got compliments all night long!"
"party","The dress fit perfect.","I am usually a 2 or 4, so I wore a small.","So many compliments on the dress!!","This was the best idea for the Christmas party I wore it to.","I wish I could keep it and I am tempted to wear it again to the other Christmas parties I am going to.","Loved it!"
"party","Its conservative, but also short and fun!","Its a cute little black dress that looked great with my loubs, but it is not something I would rent again."
"party","Fit true to size.","The small fit but was too short, the medium was perfect.","The back puckered a tiny bit but so long as I stood up straight with my shoulders back it was fine.","Make sure you get boob tape for this dress!!!!","!"
"party","This is an awesome dress, but if youre petite framed or have a short torso, it might not fit right.","I was too heavy / broad around the ribs for the size 0 and it wouldnt zip, but the size 2 was too long in the torso -- the plunge from shoulders to sternum showed bra (I had to safety-pin it) and also there was a big huge gap at the shoulders, so it looked quite obviously too big.","It was a great dress but not for my frame."
"party","This romper fit perfectly and was definitely perfect for New Years Eve!","I thought the romper wouldnt have any give but the material is actually really stretchy.","The only issue I had with it was that the sequins hurt the insides of my arms and the back of my neck... not ideal if you are going out dancing all night.","Other than that everyone seemed to love my NYE look!"
"party","This dress is beautiful on - the waist is a bit snug but the overall fit is pretty true to size.","Sequined top is beautiful.","Would definitely rent again for another event!"
"party","Fit was great and I found it ran true to size.","I vary between a 0 or 2.","I did order a size up but it was a little to big"
"party","It was a little roomy at the top, but other than that, I loved this dress.","I was comfy and got a TON of compliments on it!"
"party","This was a great dress.","I ordered the medium and the small was my backup.","I am a definite pear shape and often in body-con dresses I wear a medium.","Im not sure if the medium I got had been recently worn or stretched out, but I was happy to have the small as a backup and ended up choosing the small.","The small fit very snuggly over my back side, but also hugged my middle/top-- the medium fit about the same on the bottom, but was loose and awkward on top.","This dress has a TON of stretch and was super comfortable for dinner, drinks, dancing, etc.","It had a bit of a ribbed material look to it and I needed to wear a razor back bra, but I felt pretty, sexy, and wonderful all night.","If youre looking for a great little black dress that is both conservative and also a little sexy, this is it.","One note is that its a little tricky to zip, so make sure youve got an extra person handy to help."
"party","This jumpsuit was so classy.","The fit was true to size and so comfortable.","Only thing was if you needed to use the bathroom, you had to take the whole thing off!"
"party","This dress runs true to size and is great for any cup size, however, the open back means you cannot wear a strapless bra.","The stretchy fabric allows for a comfortable fit throughout the midsection and hips.","I am about  , and this dress felt super short and fun - definitely a mini length.","This style is best for Athletic, Full Bust, Hourglass, Petite, Pear, Tall, and Straight & Narrow body types.","Pair with sky high heels and a fun necklace"
"party","Kind of short but I am a shorter woman so it wasnt inappropriate.","This dress was so comfortable!"
"party","I normally wear a small, but sized down to the extra small for this skirt, since the waist is elastic and stretchy.","Its super comfortable and can be dressed up or down.","The top layer is tulle, with a lace layer underneath.","Im short, so it was long on me...more like a midi skirt about halfway down my calves, but overall I loved it and would definitely rent again!"
"party","I worse this for a baby shower.","My friend works in the fashion industry and so do all of her friends.","I wanted something that was trendy and stylish, and this fit the bill.","It fit well and was lined, which is always appreciated with a predominately white dress!"
"party","Got tons of compliments.","The dress was sophisticated but unique and fun.","Loved it!"
"party","The dress has a bit of a stretch with the material, but not much.","The pattern is very vivid and un, but the skirt doesnt fully attached to the bodice, there are flaps the go up on the bodice and this could bother some while wearing the dress.","I didnt get to wear this as I received it with a broken zipper.","But its very fun and great for cocktails or a more dressy date."
"party","This was so easy to wear!","I wore it w/ a graphic print tank top for my home Holiday party & some sparkly sneakers (my friends called my look sporty fancy), & I was so comfortable all night.","My sneakers had a 1.5 inch platform, & the skirt didnt drag at all.","It wasnt heavy whatsoever, & I was able to move easily & even chase & lift my two toddlers.","I do think the sizing runs small, as Im usually a 4-6, but the size SM was nowhere near fitting/zipping.","The MED however even had a little room, so there was a big difference between both sizes.","Obviously an easy choice to dress up for a more formal event, but rest assured you will be comfortable the whole evening long!"
"party","Absolutely loved it!","Received a ton of compliments.. LOVE!","LOVE!","LOVE!"
"party","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and loved it!","I was comfortable, effortless and chic.","I got so many compliments and felt great.","I usually wear a size 4 and ended up wearing the 2 which fit great.","The dress does get a little wrinkly on the bottom but nothing crazy.","If I had something else to wear all white to I would absolutely order again!"
"party","The dress was pretty true to size.","Its made of strechy material so it is very comfortable and forgiving.","The material is also thick, so it was very appropriate for a winter event.","The dress ran a little long on me; it came right about to my knees and I am 52.","The dress itself is very classy and conservative; great for a work event.","Overall I was very happy with the rental."
"party","I didnt get to wear this dress to my event as the zipper was extremely hard to get up.The dress fit fine once we got it but it took me and my two roommates to  get the zipper over the part where the bottom of the dress connects with the top."
"party","For me it ran small, but I have big hips.","Lots of compliments, looked great!"
"party","Fun dress, lined so it is a bit thicker I wore it to a dinner party and it was a hit!","Its not your typical LBD, it has a bit of edge to it!"
"party","Great fit.","Im 57 and often find the fit of jumpsuits tricky - Im too tall for regular and not tall enough for long.","This fit great, true to size!"
"party","This was a really fun romper, especially for late- night events.","We started the evening with an early dinner at 5:30pm, and I definitely felt the need to tone it down for that event, but it was great to let it loose later in the evening for drinks and dancing.","As others have mentioned, it was a bit scratchy at the hems and under the shoulders, but it didnt get in the way through the night.","To keep the girls looking good, I did a rather elaborate taping job, which kept them up and allowed me to take the romper on and off with ease, but there is probably a better way to keep things under control."
"party","This dress is lovely with beautiful, shimmering sequins, but the fit was not perfect.","The waist is a bit high (on someone 58) and it felt a bit baggy around the chest, which was surprising given how stretchy the fabric was.","Its a great dress thats probably flattering on a range of figures, but not the same level of show-stopping-ness that Ive come to expect from other RTRs Ive worn."
"party","I adored this dress and got so many compliments on it!","At first I was worried that the described fit would cause me to have to wear a size up, but my usual size 4 fit perfectly.","It was a bit short, but nothing too crazy.","Overall it was comfortable, and I felt great in it.","I really felt like a movie star in this dress!"
"party","I ordered both the medium and large but wore the medium (I felt like the large was more forgiving but it had some strange areas where the fabric gathered because it was extra).","Lots of compliments on this and I definitely stood out in a sea of black dresses.","Not sure if Id rent it again due to feeling a bit self-conscious about how tight it was and also felt myself adjusting it (it was shorter than typical for me) but it was perfect for the occasion."
"party","I wore this for my 30th birthday party.","I ordered the 4 and the 6.","Both fit, but I opted for the 6 to have a little more room for my DD bust.","Smaller chested women would be fine in their true size, but if youre like me, you may want to size up depending on how much cleavage you want.","The quality was good, and it was in good shape.","I felt trendy and confident in this outfit.","Perfect outfit to celebrate the next chapter in my life and saying goodbye to my 20s!"
"party","This was actually a last minute add-on back up dress for me, and it turned into my first choice dress very quickly (my friend wore my original first choice :) ).","I love the style, fit and color of this dress!","I wore this on new years eve and i did not feel restricted by the dress at all-i could move and dance very well in it.","The dress is a good, modest length, and the lace detail is beautiful!","All of my insecurities were hidden (arms, stomach) but thought it still hugged the body and gave me shape in a classy way.","I wore with black tights and black heels due to snow and cold temperatures, but it wound up to be perfect.","Customer service is great - very patient and helpful, even when I kept changing my mind in the days leading up to my event!","The NYE headband was such a fun added bonus too!","I brag about RTR to everyone!",":)"
"party","The color was amazing, the fabric was very flattering and it was super comfy.","Can be dressed up or down."
"party","A con is that you cant wear a bra without it showing."
"party","It was a little tight in the arms, a little lower cut than I anticipated, and a little short-waisted.","I loved the look, but the fit was off for me."
"party","Loved the feel and style, and it fell perfectly on me.","However, the chest was too big and no amount of tape was going to work.","I had to settle with constantly trying to fix the front to hide my bra."
"party","Fit perfect, was ideal length for petite.","Did look a bit more worn than I expected."
"party","I got so many compliments on this gorgeous Mara Hoffman dress.","Felt sexy, but still comfortable.","The dress accentuates the smallest part of your waist, which is super flattering, but is also flowy and comfortable.","I liked that it is a little shorter (hits around the ankles) so it wasnt dragging all night and you could see my shoes.","However, if you are taller (Im 54), it might seem a little highwater-ish.","Also, I normally wear a 6  but the material is not forgiving or stretchy, so I went up to the 8 and would recommend ordering a back up size up."
"party","The fit was perfect.","Tighter up top, but not too bad.","Easy to sit and dance in.","Loved the length."
"party","This dress is pretty true to size in my opinion and the color is absolutely gorgeous in person."
"party","The fit on this dress was incredible.","It showed just enough skin without being too much.","It was sexy but did not feel like it was over the top when i wore it to a conservative wedding and work party.","I loved the color.","I would rent again."
"party","Im 5 8, around 120 pounds with a 32B bust.","I rented this for my bridal shower and loved it!","Dark teal is one of my colors for my wedding and so I matched my shower perfectly.","I ordered a 2 and 4 but never even needed to try on the 4; the 2 fit well.","I *may* have been able to fit in a 0 since I have a small ribcage / bust, but using fashion tape and a deep plunge padded bra worked perfectly in the 2.","This was my first RTR experience and Ill definitely be back for more for other wedding activities!"
"party","Loved loved this dress!","The details on this dress made a simple black dress and little more interesting!","I got so many compliments and the length was perfect!"
"party","Outfit was great, very basic and versatile.","I received many compliments.","Accessories can really change the look of this outfit.","Only con was that the neckline can dip a little low (bending over can show down to your waist) and it was necessary for me to adhere a bit of fashion tape.","However, because it is a jumper, each time you go to the bathroom you have to take the whole thing off.","Adjustments/replacement to the fashion tape were necessary each time.","Had there been a side zipper I would have given the outfit 5 stars."
"party","This dress was very heavy, in a good way!","It didnt feel like a cheap sequined party dress but instead felt very luxurious.","I got compliments from both men and women at the restaurant.","I didnt need to close the top with the snap at all.","It was not too revealing."
"party","I loved the shape of the dress.","It didnt hug the body and was the perfect length.","I cannot stand a dress that I have to tug at all night.","This was for a work party.","It was dressy, but not over the top.","The sequins were subtle and the fit made it more casual.","The hem on the bottom and sleeves were a little odd though.","Not sure if they had been altered at one point and resewn, but it was puckered in a few spots and didnt lay flat."
"party","This was the perfect dress for my winter Bridal Shower!","I received so many compliments on how beautiful it was and I loved how much it sparkled!","Fit well and flattering in all the right places."
"party","I wore the medium because the waist was a bit fitted and there isnt a lot of give to the fabric.","I generally wear small in Amanda Uprichard dresses, however, which is why I said this one runs small.","Shiny fabric, fun back.","I wore this with black tights and high black boots.","Fun and festive for a holiday event!"
"party","I rented the dress for a new years party at a fancy hotel.","I got tons of compliments and I have to admit- no one was having a better dress.","The only hard part was the zipping up- there is no way you can do that alone.","Also I am wearing usually size 12. read that the dress runs small and ordered 14 and 16.","I did fit in 14 but it didnt look right.","You can see from the picture that wearing size 16th makes me slimmer.","Very happy with this purchase!"
"party","It fit perfectly, was totally comfortable and didnt feel tight at all, but looked fitted and snug.","the outside is kind of stretchy but the slip part was more fitted and stayed in place.","I didnt have any trouble with the straps and everyone said I looked hot.","I would absolutely rent this again."
"party","Fits well.","No complaints."
"party","I am usually a small or medium (size 6) and wore the small.","It is a very stretchy fabric, but does have a zipper up the side that could be constricting.","Loved the high neckline and bottom of the dress.","Im 58 and it reached the bottom of my calf.","Really loved the dress and recommend!"
"party","Fit was true to size.","Loved it!","!"
"party","It flatters your bust"
"party","I loved this dress!","So flattering and comfortable!","This dress runs small.","I ordered a 4 and sized up to a 6 for my backup.","Im glad I did.","I normally wear a 4, but there was NO WAY it would zip all the way up.","The 6 fit perfectly.","(Please, RTR ladies, if the dress you rent is a little small, dont force it.","You stretch it out for everyone after you.","No one can see the size label after you put it on, but they sure can tell if youre wearing something a size too small.)","I wasnt sure about an off the shoulder dress, but the cut and inner grip strip kept the dress in place all night.","I never felt the need to pull up the sleeves.","I wore it with leopard print shoes and a simple pendant necklace.","I would definitely rent this dress again."
"party","Im so happy I wore this for my 21st birthday!","The romper was so comfortable and the sequins still made it fancy enough to go barhopping on 6th Street (Austin, TX).","Its very short so tall girls, watch out."
"party","The only downside to this dress is the zipper.","When I first tried it on, the zipper kept getting stuck and took a few times to loosen it up.","I got a size 2 and a 4 and the 2 was a little too small and the 4 was a little too big, but went with the 4 because of the zipper issue.","But once I got on the dress I received so many compliments.","I wore it to a company holiday party and people I never talk to at work were coming up to me telling me how great I looked.","It was a great confidence booster!"
"party","I wore this for my bachelorette party and it was just perfect.","Fit like a glove.","My only complaint was that it was a little tight around the calves but mine are on the large side.","It was fun and I could move easily.","The chest area wasnt an issue for me but I could imagine needing to use fashion tape if the top was any bigger.","I loved it."
"party","Im obsessed with this dress, and Elizabeth and James as a result.","The fit was perfect on me and really showed off my shape (Im pear-shaped with a small waist) without being overly revealing.","The length was a bit long on me, but the fit was snug enough that it didnt look matronly.","I wore it to a new years party, but this dress would have worked in a lot of different contexts.","The one minor downside is that it did restrict my mobility a bit in terms of bending down/sitting down, but not terribly."
"party","I ordered this for my Bachelorette Weekend and Im so glad I did.","I constantly got compliments and comments about how people loved the blush sequins versus the typical white dresses they see Bachelorettes in.","I ordered a 4 and a 2 and Im so so glad I got the 2 because the 4 was really big in the hips and the way the material draped, it added weight there.","The 2 fit perfectly, so it does run a little large as I usually would wear a 4 in other styles.","I have sensitive skin and the sequins didnt bother me at all.","The best part about this dress is not only did it look fabulous, I could also eat and drink all night without worrying about it!"
"party","I normally wear a size 2 or 4... this 0 was a perfect fit and I loved that it wasnt so form fitting along the midsection and that I could still wear a comfortable crossback bra.","I appreciated the length which was probably meant to be a little shorter, but I thought it was perfect for my 52 height.","Sequins were slightly irritating under the arms by the end of the night  but totally worth it!","Lots of compliments throughout the night and will most definitely rent this one again!"
"party","Im usually between a 6 and 8, and the 8 fit perfectly.","Zippers were sticky on both dresses, but just needed someone else to help zip it up.","Overall, very happy with this rental."
"party","Loved this dress.","I used a stick on bra and felt super confident and classy for a cocktail party.","The length of the dress was perfect and I got lots of compliments on the back!","Im 510 and usually wear a 6 but chose the 8."
"party","This dress is so fun and flattering.","The colors hide and make you seem more hour-glassed than you may otherwise be.","The back is great but a bit tricky to get the shoulders to stay up as the night wore on.","My husband LOVED this one though.","It is definitely short and tighter on the bottom than it is on the top, but its great fun while youre wearing it!"
"party","I wasnt so sure about this dress when I first tried it on - but I got a ton of compliments.","It fit easily - and was small bump friendly (Im pregnant and just starting to show).","The sequins were quite scratchy under the arms.","I also ended up having to safety pin to show a little less cleavage.","This would be a great dress for NYE or a holiday party."
"party","I rented this dress for my bachelorette party, butI was not able to wear the dress for my event because it was too big.","The dress is sparkly, beautiful, and perfect for that special event, but it does run large!","I weigh around 115 and the XS was too big to be as va-va-voom and fitted as I wanted it to be for the big night.","Next time I will listen more to the reviews before I get a dress that will not fit right, but I look forward to my next rental!"
"party","I loved the weight and fabric of this dress, but it is NOT cut for girls with more of a bosom.","To give my top even a little breathing room, I had to size up.","I fit into a 4 from the waist down and the 6 was a tight squeeze on top, but an 8 would have had way too much fabric in the straps despite still being a little tight on top."
"party","not sure why, but one of the straps was v long and it kept slipping maybe im too short for this and that was the issue?","otherwise, im typically a 4 and the small fit great!","even the length worked well despite being rather short.","i highly recommend this jumpsuit to someone taller."
"party","Not too short.","Fits true to size."
"party","The fit was very complimentary and comfortable and not too snug.","I got compliments all night long!","It also wasnt too short but still very sexy.","The sequins did catch on each other every once in awhile but it was overall a great dress.","Very easy, didnt have to use many accessories because the dress said it all!"
"party","I think this dress is perfect if you want to look fashionable and trendy, but I would not describe the dress as sexy.","The material does not hug your body, which may be a negative if you like to show off your curves.","I wore a nubra and it worked well.","The back is lovely, the material is beautiful, I received compliments all night.","Its a beautiful dress.","I also found it difficult to pair shoes with it - I ended up going with a gold/metallic shoe, but I think a nude pump would have looked better."
"party","Fits great.","I felt beautiful with lots of compliments"
"party","Im usually a 10 in dresses, but have a full bust, so Im glad I went with the 12.","At first I thought it would be itchy but it wasnt at all.","I received tons of complements.","I would definitely rent again!"
"party","Loved the dress, great fit, with pockets!"
"party","Super cute, bright, and summery style!","Running true to size we recommend sizing up for backup.","The fabric does not have much give, but there is still room in the bust for a variety of cup sizes.","The cut of the dress allows for you to wear a standard bra and although the waist is belted and fitted at the natural waist its still super comfortable.","Hips are roomy and the pleating gives it an extra little something.","At 57 the length hit just above my knee.","Pair with white sneakers or strappy sandals for a preppy spring/summer look!"
"party","The dress was fine...","It just didnt do what I thought it would, felt really boxy and was too long.","I didnt end up wearing the dress to my event.","Kind of a bummer."
"party","First experience with Herve Leger!","It was a really form fitting dress that really sucks you in!","I had to go with the small because the top of the medium was a little too big but I also barely have any type of bust!","Overall great dress, would definitely rent again!"
"party","The dress is adorable, comfortable, and looks great.","I usually wear a 6 and will probably get a 4 if I rent it again so it will fit better.","If  you are outdoors and it is windy, the bottom is VERY flowy so make sure you have the right undergarments ;)"
"party","The dress fit like a glove!","It flattered my figure and made me feel sexy without showing too much skin.","It is very comfortable, and not itchy like some lace can be.","I ordered an XS and S and ended up going with the XS because the S had a little too much extra fabric.","I wore this dress to a house party and got many compliments on it.","I loved this dress and I would definitely recommend it!"
"party","This dress is extremely form fitting!","i loved the way it fit so tightly and it hugs you in all the right places.","the xsmall ran very small!","the small was a little big around the chest and shoulder area but it worked out fine.","the black and nude color of this dress was very pretty especially with a nude clutch or a black patent leather clutch.","classy classy"
"party","Excellent condition, like new, definitely no one would guess that it is a rental.","Short hemline, as shown in the models photo.","The weather on the night of my event turned unusually cold so I had to wear tights, which looked fine.","Without hosiery this dress may be too short, especially when you sit down and your entire leg is exposed."
"party","I went with an 8 Long and it was true to size.","I paired it with 4 inch heels, but it was still somewhat long, which wasnt an issue since I wanted a dramatic look for the evening.","Returning was super easy, thanks Rent the Runway!"
"party","I am definitely round in that area and would have worn it with leggings even though I think its a dress."
"party","I ordered an xs with a small for the backup.","I ended up wearing the xs, although both fit very similar.","I could have gone with either one.","The dress was beautiful.","The blue was very vibrant, and really stood out.","I was comfortable dancing all night, and the thick fabric kept me warm.","I would definitely recommend this dress.","It was fun, flirty, and sucks you in, so no need for spanx!"
"party","Sleeves are a bit long, but otherwise perfect fit."
"party","This dress is stunning in person.","The gold detail really pops off the navy fabric.","I received compliments all day!","The material was a little heavy for a summer day but other than that was perfection.","Can be worn to a casual affair or dressed up.","Would definitely recommend!"
"party","this is a nice dress; i wore it for a fiesta themed party.","the material has a nice weight to it and it was very flattering.","it hit about 2 above the knee and i am short."
"party","I wanted a funky avant garde dress for my night out in Vegas to see Cirque de Soleil and the Nha Khahn dress was perfect match.","Not only was it a visually beautiful dress, I felt on top of the world and had fun strutting around the city as the tail swayed behind me.","The dress look just as it is pictured on the website.","As noted in the reviews it was a little tight in the ribcage.","I am a 32B and the 2 was just a bit snug when I exhaled but not too uncomfortable to not wear.","I didnt get to try the size 4 but felt if I did go up I would not be able to fill the chest unless I wore a double padded bra.","Being 5’2” Im always concerned where a short dress’s length will hit on my thighs but the asymmetrical length was very forgiving.","The front was short enough to be flirty but comfortable where I didnt have to constantly check or tug at the skirt; this may be different for taller women.","The back tail was also not too long but didnt look like I was swimming.","I loved loved loved the print.","It is very artsy and was appropriate for my theater performance I think the print is ambiguous enough that it could also pass in a more conservative setting."
"party","the dress was very flattering & fun.","I am pretty proportional, but lots of times waists dont hit me in the right spot- normally too close to my rib cage, or too low/loose in the belly and then i look pregnant.","The dress was still a little loose in the waist area, but I could not have gone down another size because of my chest, ribs and back.","This dress fit great, looked great, my fiance and my friends all loved it too.","The skirt is truly fun to wear, while still looking very classy"
"party","NOTE: I am currently about 134lbs and 32D - breastfeeding and still trying to lose baby weight - so my measurements dont match what was put in before for sizing!!","Wore this to my 10 year high school reunion dinner.","This has such a nice 50s housewife shape to it.","Perfect with pearl earrings.","Light cotton blend fabric with just enough heft to hold its shape.","The demure neckline was exactly what I wanted to downplay my new boobs (never really had these before baby...).","Would definitely rent this again, but there are always new beautiful dresses - so why rent any twice!","?"
"party","As advertised this is a trapeze dress, so if you were hoping to define your waist get a belt.","The waist was also below my true waist so I didnt think it complimented my body very well.","That being said, it is a pretty color and would be fun for dancing."
"party","No cons.","Loved it."
"party","So fun - sparkly and created instant cleavage!","Dress is snug in the waist/ribcage area and the flared skirt left room for my larger hips."
"party","although sequined, still stretchy"
"party","This dress was amazing.","I ordered the L and got the M as a backup.","The L was way too big but the M fit perfectly.","The only slight concern was the height of the slits since Im 59.","It worked for me but I could not have worn heels.","I was able to wear a normal bra and it was comfortable to wear all day.","I would highly recommend."
"party","Wrap dress that doesnt open on when you sit down and looks great.","This is not my normal style but it worked great and I got a bunch of compliments."
"party","I wore this for a night out in Vegas.","I rented the Small and XS.","XS was tight-fitting and I wore the Small for a looser fit due to my large bust size (34D).","The small fit great, however, the straps were still too long when I adjusted them as short as they would go.","Luckily, I brought a bra strap converter (the plastic thing that clamps straps together to make racerback).","Although it showed, my hair covered it and it was fine.","I got so many compliments on this.","Sequins did not rub at all and it was comfy!","The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the strap issue.","I would definitely rent this again!"
"party","I rented this for a Dress in your best black and white Semi-Formal Sweet 16 Party in West Palm Beach, FL in August.","The Dress is absolutely gorgeous!","It is light and cool and so comfortable to dance in all night.","I did not have any problems with moving my arms as I read in some reviews but I do have narrow shoulders.","Im short and the length was very appropriate for the occasion.","When I walked in people stopped me to compliment the dress and I received compliments all night and many complimented over and over.","I got a size 10 and 12 as a backup, the 10 was perfect.","The 10 did not have an attached slip like the size 12 did, but I received 2 additional slips in 2 sizes and one was perfect although no lingerie straps to hold it in place, it worked very well.","The quality is top notch, I so wish I could buy this dress!!","One tip, the slip is a must as the dress is very sheer.","I loved this dress!"
"party","Loved this top!","It was really cute with white jeans, and I wore it once with jean shorts as well.","A great work, day-to-night transitional piece.","It is a little short in the front, so keep this in mind if you have a long torso."
"party","Its great quality, structured which I love, and really beautiful."
"party","the body of the dress is flattering and its true to size.","However similar to what other reviews have indicated the sleeves are tight and the lace has no stretch.","While it is okay for a short period of time after a while the lack of movement was too much and I did not end up wearing the dress.","Given that the middle is not too form fitting I would advise sizing up maybe 1 or two sizes for arm comfort."
"party","It is a beautiful dress and I received a lot of compliments all night.","I wear either size 6 or 8 ( it depends on the fitting of the dress) and this dress was too big in the chest and shoulders for me.","Im a size b and had to wear one of those Victoria secret bras that makes two cup sizes bigger to attempt to make it fit a little better.","This dress would be great for someone with a larger chest (c and up).","The other thing is the fabric of this dress is really heavy.","It would be great for the fall and winter when its cold, but I was wearing it in the desert when it was a 100 degrees."
"party","Colors were amazing fit was good just very short"
"party","Loved this dress.","the fit was good and super stretchy so it made it very comfortable.","I received many compliments, especially on the one shoulder bit.","Was told I looked like a movie star!","!"
"party","Very warm and cute."
"party","Wore this to an office Christmas party with skinny jeans and heels.","Looked so cute.","The lace is very stiff and a bit scratchy.","You also will have to have someone zip you up because this zipper is sticky!","Overall a really cute shirt without being overly sexy.","The peplum is completely see through, so if you dont want your belly to show, you may want to pass."
"party","I rented this dress for a Southern Blue Grass & Pig Roast Cocktail Party.","The dress itself is a gorgeous material.","Very vibrant and flattering HOWEVER, it is sooooo tight on the chest.","I was pretty uncomfortable most of the night due to the chest of the dress literally smashing my boobs.","I dont think I have a large chest and found it to be too tight.","If you are an A in the chest then the dress will probably fit beautifully but I am a B cup and it was too tight."
"party","This dress was my backup dress but ended up wearing it for the event.","It was very comfortable and I didnt even have to wear a bra because the fabric was thick enough.","Pockets were great!"
"party","This looked really cool with a very chunky bubble-pearl necklace.","I got lots of compliments on the fit and flattering color.","The attached split cape added a bit of a more formal touch without being stuffy."
"party","I rented this dress for a bachelorette party.","The color, lace, and overall quality of the dress was gorgeous.","I got so many compliments!","I wish I could keep it!","The dress does run a little small and i ordered a 10 and a 12 and ended up wearing the 12.","It was a little snug on the arms but it seemed to loosen up a but by the end of the night.","This dress will not disappoint.","Pair with some nude pumps and you are good to go!","Thank you rent the runway for a great experience."
"party","This was not the dress I had originally ordered, but since that one was returned damaged, I had to rush to find a back up.","This one worked nicely, although I was more than a little aware of the cleavage!","The dress was true to size and fit nicely.","I would caution against bracelets, as mine kept getting attached to me and it took another person to get free.","The color was not as bright as I would have liked, but it does photograph well in the right light.","Overall pleased, but now my coworkers know a lot more about me than they used to!"
"party","Only downside was that it tended to ride up while dancing so be careful ladies..."
"party","Wore this for my husbands holiday party.....I had never worn a long sleeve cocktail dress and was excited to try this one.","the cool cut outs and details on the waist seemed to give it that kick you want.","However, when you put the dress on, unless your standing at a certain angle, you really dont notice those details.","The dress itself is beautiful, but the other thing I noticed (which is NOT the dresss fault), is that when you stand with your hands at your side, the long sleeves just makes you look wider...like your arms and waist all blend into one.",":) Hands on your hips for this one ladies :)"
"party","Not for a pear-shaped body type, the hips were too snug and the lining showed.","The ruffles were ENORMOUS and while the dress seemed to be almost brand new and there in great shape, this mean that ruffles were very stiff.","I felt like a clown and did not wear it out.","The print is really cute and great color for a daytime party or bridal shower."
"party","Material was perfect and dress was fun and easy to wear."
"party","I loved it!","Gorgeous on, very flattering fit.","For me it was true to size."
"party","This romper is awesome, and it has pockets!","I absolutely loved it, perfect for any classy occasion."
"party","this dress was so great!","super comfy and i loved the pockets.","it is a little bit more silvery than the picture but still beautiful.","white overall with silver threading.","received so many compliments on it!"
"party","Loved the bright color of this dress and wanted to love the style, but it was just too short for my long legs and didnt flatter my small chest.","I rented it as back-up to my first choice Shoshanna dress because my first choice wasnt available in my back-up size.","I found that Shoshanna dresses run pretty true to size and opted to wear a similar style, which I LOVED (Watermelon Lace Dress)"
"party","Fit was perfect, the petite while a little long was great with a pair of 3 heels.","Stretchy comfort for the entire night."
"party","This dress was very cute but I ultimately decided not to wear it because it showed the fat under the arms in the front."
"party","Stylish and classic.","The epitome of dressy casual.","Chosen for a housewarming party at a clubhouse.","(The a/c was out, so a much looser outdoorsy dress was required and therefore this was just tried on for sizing check.)","Absolutely would rent again.","Incredibly easy to wear.","My husband is a full foot taller than I am, so I always wear 4-5.5 heels when we are out together.","This was very easy to move and sit, stand and walk in.","I burped babies and played with toddlers while still looking fantastic.","This dress is ideal for the hourglass or athletic build.","It would work for an apple or pear build.","It would not flatter a straight/narrow build nor a full busted build.","It would also not flatter a long torso - this dress will elongate your torso visually.","Ideal fit for those 5-57.","58-510 would be good for a sexier look.","Avoid renting above 510."
"party","Overall, this romper was great.","I wore this for a friends holiday party and I received numerous compliments throughout the evening.","It definitely runs a bit large, I dont normally fit into an XS - the top portion definitely showed off my cleavage.","I would order a size down than you normally do just to be on the safe side."
"party","I usually wear a 0 so this dress is true to size.","The skirt was not tight on me but if you have hips, i can see the skirt being constricting.","It fit perfectly."
"party","Aside from the zipper bunching on the side like most people mention, it was a great dress.","Really comfortable and sexy without being inappropriate.","I was a little concerned how it would fit on my chest, so I ordered the small and medium.","But the material gives a lot and I ended up wishing I had gone with an XS and S.  Regardless, I got a ton of compliments and was happy with the dress.","Great customer service."
"party","I also recommend sizing up one size, I usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses and I wore the 10 in this one.","I say that with the caveat that the 8 wasnt available so I didnt get to see how it would have fit.","but the 10 was comfortable and flattering.","The material is really thin almost mesh-like, with a thicker more opaque layer underneath the main body of the dress (the last inch or two of the hem is sheer mesh, it has sequins but no underlayer).","You can wear a regular bra with this dress, which was nice.","The material was very light and easy to wear, not heavy at all like a lot of sequined dresses are.","I personally found the sequins irritating under the arms but not as badly as some other sequined dresses I have worn in the past.","I wore a full length shaping slip underneath, Ive had two kids so...it is not a supportive material, for what its worth.","This was my first rent the runway purchase and I will definitely be using it again, this dress was great quality and material and fit exactly like I expected based on the description and reviews by others.","I am 58, 150 lbs, hourglass figure, 32dd."
"party","Great, easy dress to wear.","I am pear-shaped and the top fit like a glove while the bottom had room for my hips.","Pretty blue w/ black lace.","Will try and rent again!"
"party","Fits very well for all my pear shaped friends!","Didnt like the look of it as much out of the box, but it looks great on and it photographs really well too.","Has the perfect amount of shimmer and sparkle!","Wore it to a small graduation dinner and party and it flowed well into the evening when we went out for drinks and dancing after.","Got compliments all night long."
"party","Great fit, just a bit short.","Material is thick so it was great for NYE and the cold weather!"
"party","The dress fit great.","I normally wear a 4 or a 6 but picked the 6 as it was the best fitting.","The length was perfect for a work party - not too short.","I am really tall so this dress was a great choice!","Most of the time, dresses run really  short on me.","The service was great and as expected.","The dress rubbed a little bit on my arms but it didnt really bother me at all."
"party","True to size, very flattering."
"party","Loved this dress!","First time renting, and everyones reviews were spot on.","I wore this dress to a fundraiser, and had an amazing time.","It was pretty stiff, and If i had to dance I wouldnt have had a great time doing so.","There isnt really any stretch."
"party","I wore this dress for an office Christmas party and a night on the town in NYC.","It looked real cute with my silk blazer for the office part of the evening, and was really fashion forward for the night out after.","I had tons of compliments.","The only problem with the dress is how restrictive the shoulders are with the sleeves.","You cant lift your arms over your head, so it took me a couple tries to figure out how to get the zipper all the way up on my own.","It was possible, but I do have very flexible shoulders."
"party","This is a super adorable dress.","Very comfortable and fits very well.","I liked that it has pockets, but I didnt need to use them like I thought.","I wore flats with the dress since it was a baby shower during the day, but I could have easily worn heels.","Hope you enjoy the dress as much as I did!"
"party","Loved this rental.","My only complaint was my fault- I think the 6 would have been more comfy.","The 4 fit great at the beginning of the night but was quite short on me (I prefer longer hemlines tho) and by the end of the night was really right around my bust (but Im a 32D).","So I think I should have ordered the 6 instead.","Perfect for a rehearsal dinner or summer wedding."
"party","Beautiful gown!","I wore it to my husbands holiday party and loved every minute of wearing it.","I felt amazing all night and I received so many compliments.","The P length was perfect with 3 heels.","The 4P wouldnt quite zip due to my athletic build/wide shoulders but the 6P was perfect.","I definitely wanted to keep it!","!"
"party","Loved this dress!","Fantastic color... its a bright, cobalt blue that photographs really well.","I got compliments all night!","The dress is short, and the fabric is kind of stiff, which actually is nice because it hides any flaws you might have :)  My only complaint is that the dress I received looked like it had been worn quite a few times and had some pilling on the fabric.","RTR might want to retire the dress they sent me."
"party","This dress was selected for me by RTR because the dress I originally ordered was returned damaged by the previous wearer.","This dress fits beautifully and is quite a stunner.","Even though its strapless and lightly boned, I did not have to adjust it at all through out the evening and it was comfortable for sitting.","Like other reviewers said, theres built in support in the form of a separate set of hook-closures in the back before zipping up.","The skirt does pouf like in the photo, theres crinoline on the hips, but it works with the rest of the dress and not disproportionate.","But the dress is not so formal that you feel weirdly overdressed.","The pockets, two big ones on either side, are really great for stashing mints or lipstick."
"party","I normally wear a 10 or a 12 but I got the 14 in this due to other reviews and it was spot on.","The extra ruffle adds some flair to the dress.","Everyone loved it and I got a ton of compliments on it.","The fabric is nice and thick feeling and the dress hugs all the curves."
"party","Size 10 was unavailable so I ordered the 8 and the 12.","The 8 was too small and the 12 too large, but I wore the 12.","It was loose in the chest but a good length and fine with the wise.","Typically I wear a 36D for a bra if that helps people.","I wore a halter style bra so the straps wouldnt peek through."
"party","This dress is gorgeous in person - beautiful lace and the color is awesome.","I wish I had taken a picture with it on.","It does hug your curves, but it is flirty and so so comfortable!","Would rent this again in a heartbeat!"
"party","Wasnt able to wear the dress but loved the color, style and design of it"
"party","This dress has the twirl factor, sleeves, and a high neckline.","It was exactly what I needed for my bridal shower."
"party","This dress was AH-MAZING.","Wore it to my formal company anniversary party and people almost didnt recognize me.","The sheer midriff and sleeves were perfect."
"party","I wore this date to a sorority semi formal and I kept getting compliments the whole night!","The color is very unique and this is the party dress.","The dress is a little heavy, low cut i)f youre not used to cleavage), and runs a little small but over all very flattering and photographs like a dream!"
"party","This dress fit like a glove & made me feel like a million bucks.","It was a little tricky to get on, but once I did, it was amazing!!","The cutouts were high & were very slimming.","LOVED this dress"
"party","The 2R was about 10 inches too long!","Cute style and beautiful fabric.","The 0 would have been a perfect fit but it wasnt available.","I did not end up wearing this as it was too big and waayyy too long."
"vacation","This jacket was perfect for my trip to Paris during a cold spell this spring.","The lining kept me cozy and warm and I was able to wear this with jeans during the day and still pair it with dressier outfits at night.","The lining does pull out around the cuffs and there was a small rip in the leather, but it was barely noticeable.","I didnt love how this looked on me when it was all the way zipped up, but luckily it was cozy enough that I stayed warm even with it unzipped.","The leather is super soft and it the fit is true to size.","This is a really versatile piece that will be hard to send back!"
"vacation","This romper does run small, especially for the long torso women out there.","Per previous reviews the arms were also tight and I consider myself to have long slender arms.","Overall if you size up with that in mind its definitely a wearable piece and absolutely beautiful on.","I love how the shorts flute out to look more like a dress, it is very slimming to the legs.","Can also be dressed up or down.","Planned to wear it in Vegas but had to cancel my trip due to a family illness.","Will definitely rent for another occasion."
"vacation","This dress was great for a girls weekend getaway in Ojai.","I wore it belted but I also loved the look of it just big and flowy.","I would recommend sizing down as it runs large.","I got a lot of compliments while out shopping for the day."
"vacation","The first thing i noticed was how heavy and structured it was.","pictures do not do this dress justice.","The embroidery is amazing.","Less white than it looks here.","It could easily be worn for a cute barn wedding or reception.","I usually wear a 6 but i opted for the 8 because it gave me a bit more breathing room."
"vacation","I love this jumpsuit!","It is cute with the designs and details on the shoulder and the material was very comfortable it almost feels like wearing pjs!","But the belt made a lot of difference once it cinches on the waist as without the belt would definitely look like pjs!","The material is very light so perfect for summer or early fall weather!","Great for a day of walking outside (used it for vacation).","I did not mind the buttons as others had mentioned.","It was still easy to get it off and put it back on compared to other jumpsuits that I wore."
"vacation","I love this romper, I have rented it several times.","Its perfect for a vacation because it travels so well.","I find that it runs bigger up top and I typically size down to  accommodate that.","The only tough part is that the buttons in the back require a friend.","Pictured is me wearing it super dressed down to a sporting event, which I then changed my shoes and wore to dinner later on."
"vacation","I loved this daring look - only in VEGAS.","Got a bit itchy towards the end of the night, but totally worth it."
"vacation","This looks more navy than purple in person.","It is very short, and tight in the crotch.","I have a short torso, so I wasnt expecting this problem.","Extending the straps didnt help, it made the top more lowcut and it was still uncomfortable.","The overall effect was indecent, so unfortunately I could not wear this piece!"
"vacation","This dress for a night out on vacation with my friend in Miami.","The material is gorgeous and it fit perfectly.","Its comfortable and classy.","Its a more casual style which I loved.","I posted a pic on Facebook and a few people said it reminded them of the pretty woman dress."
"vacation","It fit great on my chest but squeezed flesh through the cut outs in an unattractive way :( Also, it was an awkward length at mid calf.","I think this dress would look great on a taller, skinnier girl.","Also, it is a mint green, not white-ish as pictured."
"vacation","Pros: incredibly flattering in the bust and waist.","Its not your average jumpsuitCons: that I dont own this!"
"vacation","If you have a long torso this is NOT the outfit for you - I had to go back and check to make sure I didnt order a petite size.","Pretty disappointed because the top looks so nice, but I need a good 3 to 4 more inches to be able to walk in this thing.","For reference, I am 58."
"vacation","Lining on the tight side while outer dress is baggy."
"vacation","The waist was comfortable, the length was perfect.","I have a large bust and needed to wear a bra, but the bustline showed any bra I tried on, so I just wore a cute bra and made it part of the look and it worked."
"vacation","This dress is extremely cute in person.","I rented for a long weekend in Nashville, TN.","I could have worn this during the day with some flats too, but just wore it out at night with the Kendra Scott Harlow Necklace (also rented) and my cowboy boots.","The color is perfect for summer and it had pockets, which I didnt use.","The lining is a nude silk and very comfortable.","It does run large.","Im typically a size 4 and very small chested.","The 4 was too big in the rib cage area and the straps kept falling down.","I contacted RTR and they had a 2 and shipped it overnight.","It fit like a glove.","This was my 7th rent and Im never disappointed.","Ive already bought one of the dresses I rented (took 4 weeks to find online)...this orange lace dress is another I will be looking to buy!","A++"
"vacation","Perfect for vacation.","Fit great in the bust.","May run a little large but fit perfectly for me.","The size 10 was ok, but I like things a little looser.","The lining is a stretch material which makes it super comfy."
"vacation","Runs small and looked over-worn.","Need to take this out of rotation"
"vacation","This dress fit perfectly an was very comfortable for a night out while on vacation.","I had no idea I would have been proposed to, but Im so happy I was wearing a fabulous dress to mark the occasion!"
"vacation","Loved the color and dress, but upper body portion was too long.","It ended up showing most part of the bra."
"vacation","I wore this dress for a night out in Vegas and really liked it.","It did run slightly small, so I wonder if a size up would have been a better fit, but my regular size was OK.","There was a minor amount of chafing on my inner arms, but it wasnt very noticeable until the end of the night.","I would definitely get this dress again."
"vacation","Runs a bit boxy but is warm and the pockets are super helpful!","Basic but stylish coat."
"vacation","I got the medium and the large and ended up wearing the large.","It wrapped around perfectly and there was a hidden snap to help it stay in place.","I loved the wide collar.","It was the perfect light weight coat for mid fall.","Im sure Ill rent it again."
"vacation","Unfortunately I didnt get to wear this on vacation, but it was a nice jumper.","I ordered a large, but a medium would have been better.","It slipped on and off easily.","All you have to do is undo the buttons in the front.","The back buttons wouldnt have been an issue."
"vacation","Ordered a 2.","Loved the color, fabric, and style.","It was loose fitting so I could have gone down a size and would have been perfectly comfortable."
"vacation","I am IN LOVE with this dress!","I wanted so badly to keep it for myself!","I honestly wasnt sure about the dress at first because I am 59, small bust and curvy hips.","But the dress fit like a GLOVE and I received so many compliments (rented a size 8)!","Wore it out to a nightclub in Vegas and there was NO other dress like it!","So many girls were touching the fabric of the dress and I received so many compliments!","My friends said it looked as if the dress were tailored for me.","The top is a perfect fit, even with my broad shoulders and small bust - it actually enhanced the look of my chest!","The bottom was fitting at my hips which kept the dress from riding up.","I felt like GOLD in this dress and didnt want to take it off!","Definitely a show-stopper and cant wait to rent again!"
"vacation","The dress is beautiful, fits well and flows nicely.","The material is thick so looks nice.. a couple of inch heels needed for my height.","can be work with flats as well.","loved it for my birthday."
"vacation","I loved this top!","I wore it with skinny high-rise jeans during a weekend trip to LA.","You dont need a bra with its built-in shelf, but you could if you wanted extra support.","Ive never worn a crop-top before, so I appreciated the elaborate lace for a little more cover-up, but it was still flirty.","Youll have a blast wearing this!"
"vacation","It was comfortable and fit well."
"vacation","So I said it runs small as I dont generally need to buy clothes in an XL (granted, I rarely buy designer clothing).","It was a great fit though and my body looked awesome.","You could totally go braless if you dont have a plunging one, but it looked way better with it!.","I loved that I felt so sexy, but I actually ended up with some minor scratches on my arm from the sequins.","All in all, a great dress for an event where you want to look really hot!"
"vacation","comfortable!"
"vacation","I brought this to Puerto Rico for my brothers wedding/mini vacation.","It is AMAZING!","Its light and flowy, and shows a bit of cleavage.","The print is beautiful, and it goes from beach to dinner to the bar effortlessly.","RENT THIS!"
"vacation","This was a great dress, I loved that I could wear a normal bra with it, it was short, but I didnt find it crawling up.","Probably could have worn the small, but it would have been very short.","So much fun, I would totally rent this dress again."
"vacation","I wore this for a trip to Savannah, GA!","We toured all day and it was VERY comfortable!","The length is  modest enough for church tours, but also fun enough for an afternoon wine tasting!","The fabric is stretchy and a bit silky."
"vacation","Fit is large and coat is boxy.","One of the unlimited rental, I wore this everyday on vacation and it was warm enough for fall temps and can be worn causally or dressed up."
"vacation","It was so comfortable!","The fit was perfect and very true to size!","Super flattering too."
"vacation","great flowy dress that is perfect for a beach vacation"
"vacation","Slightly tight, but overall great fit.","Super flattering and fun."
"vacation","Pros: I was super comfortable wearing it.","The color is beautiful and its unique.","Cons: I had to size up and I found myself pulling it up more times.","But its worth it."
"vacation","Very COMFORTABLE to wear- I wore with Cowboy boots for a fun look!"
"vacation","this dress is much prettier in person, the color is a wine burgundy and very flattering on skintones.","This fabric is UBER soft and the interesting neckline makes it fun.","wear with heels to dress up, flats to dress down, but just a comfy dress that looks quality for sure ;)"
"vacation","Good length, not too short."
"vacation","The top part of the dress fit great.","Cleavage, shoulders, back, and waist, and side cut-outs were all perfect.","The bottom part was a little too tight, I have curvier thighs and a larger butt so the size 4 may have been a better fit.","They were out at the time of my event.","Overall I got many compliments."
"vacation","loved this dress, it was easy, effortless and the perfect amount of sheer"
"vacation","I really cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this dress!","It was absolutely jaw-dropping, extremely comfortable, and super unique.","I received compliment after compliment all night.","I ordered both the Small and XS, but didnt even bother trying on the Small after trying on the XS.","The dress has plenty of stretch and will hug your curves.","If you are the type of person who needs to wear a bra, this dress may not work for you, as it is backless.","I have a small chest, and wore one of those sticky bras, which was perfect.","Rent this dress!!!","You will not regret it!"
"vacation","I loved this romper!!","I wear a 4/27 for my waist/hips, but am a D/DD cup, so I went with the medium.","For larger busted girls, it definitely shows some cleavage--use some tape, if you want it a bit more modest (I didnt.)","The medium, without the belt, would have been loose in the waist, but once tied, it was perfect.","I didnt think it was too short and I have pretty long legs--I wore it with flats and wedges.","Maybe due to the fact it was a medium?","I got SO many compliments from random people and my friends on it--I actually ended up buying it from Revolve!","Totally worth it."
"vacation","Its a lot looser than I expected, but I liked the comfortable larger fit and it was very warm!","I didnt realize it came with black sleeves, which were a really nice detail."
"vacation","This dress gives off serious boho vibes.","I felt so comfortable in this!","This dress runs true to size and is great for any cup size.","There is comfortable room for hips and curves, and the fabric is very stretchy.","We recommend wearing a NuBra or no bra, since the straps are so skinny.","Wear this to an outdoor party or a day at the park!"
"vacation","This shirt was cute, and pretty true to the description.","The bell sleeves are rather large, so be prepared for that.","I usually can wear a small or medium, but I was glad that I got the medium in this one.","It does wrinkle a bit, so just be okay with that."
"vacation","Super cute, comfy and stylish.","Be sure to order 1 size down, this dress runs large.","I originally ordered a small and ended up wearing and XS."
"vacation","Super cute.","Material is not what I expected - more of a thick cotton, but its comfortable and perfect for a night out at the beach."
"vacation","Fit perfect, except short when sitting down."
"vacation","I rented this as a cover-up for a vacation and it was perfect.","It would have been too short to wear as an everyday outfit.","The material was perfect for hot weather.","The off the shoulder stayed up and wasnt too tight.","The only reason I say it runs small is that the shorts are SHORT."
"vacation","Had rented in blue and white already, but especially loved it in red.","Worked really well with my coloring!"
"vacation","Great for daytime wedding or wine tasting!"
"vacation","I rented this for my trip to Paris but I actually wore it to see Hamilton in Chicago and then all day touring the Louvre and then straight to dinner.","It was very figure flattering on and comfortable.","I would rent again and would consider purchase"
"vacation","I received this dress as one of my backups and ended up wearing for an event.","It was a lot sparkly than I expected (no complaints about that) and my friends loved it.","The low back is beautiful.","I went with a 6 because 4, although it fit, wouldve been too short.","I wasnt a big fan of the shoulder pads, it made my shoulders look pretty wide.","Otherwise, beautiful dress."
"vacation","So flattering - easy to dress up and worn with jeans and wedges = the perfect vacation outfit."
"vacation","Loved this dress but it runs small.","I normally wear a small but definitely need the medium in this.","Its is very fitted so be prepared for that!"
"vacation","I wore this dress out on the town for a Vegas girls weekend trip.","It was such a great fit.","I normally wear a 12 and was nervous about the 12 fitting for I had never used RTR before, it couldnt have fit better.","I didnt wear a bra because the dress fits so perfectly, you dont need it."
"vacation","I rented this for a bachelorette trip.","It was a little too tight in the bust but the sister of the bride wore it for dinner one night.","It was a adorable to twirl in."
"vacation","I rented this for a Memorial Day weekend trip to Austin.","It was about 90 degrees or more while I was there, so I really needed an outfit that would make me feel comfortable in the heat while touring around.","This dress was just what I was looking for.","I love the pattern and the lightweight fabric--although for that reason, its not a good dress for a windy place!","The bust had a lot of room in it (I am a 36DDD and did not have a problem with the buttons).","As a whole, the dress runs large.","Would rent again."
"vacation","Loved the colors, they photograph well and are flattering on anyone.","Floral without appearing too girly"
"vacation","OMG Im obsessed with this dress.","It was so beautiful and comfortable and so easy to wear.","Im keeping my eye out for if and/or when it becomes a part of the clearance sale.","It fits as it should... the only minor complaint is that the material is very simple and wrinkles easily.","So be prepared to have a steamer/iron handy before you wear this beauty!"
"vacation","Definitely stood out on formal night on our cruise with this dress!","It flows beautifully and skimmed the floor with my 4 heels.","Ladies with wider rib cages - this can be a little bit tight at the waistband, so just FYI.","The 12 fit TTS, but would have liked just a little more give there (even though it was fine to wear).","Wore with shapewear even though I didnt really need it, and a simple necklace and chandelier earrings.","Truly a knockout, so many compliments."
"vacation","This definitely runs small (go up a size if you have hips and/or booty!","), but its a flattering, comfortable dress for dancing the night away.","I tried a racerback bra, but the straps peeked out, so I went with a strapless and was thrilled that I still had a smooth silhouette."
"vacation","The dress fit great, but the sequins did not lie flat, so were very irritating around the armpit and neck/back area.","I wore this in Vegas and was so excited, only to be uncomfortable all night!","RTR was AMAZING though and gave me a $30 credit to my account after I emailed them about the problem."
"vacation","I was expecting 70 or such degree dresses casual for a weekend away.","This was a perfect 10 in weight of jacket and the colors vibrant din print more fun then a sweater and a nice change up from jean jacket."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a beach vacay and it worked out great.","SO glad I got the XS option because I was swimming in the S (and I am not usually a small).","I would definitely recommend that you size 1 to 2 sizes down.","The length was great for me, even though it does run long.","I could have gotten away with wearing a wedge in the XS Long and I am 58.","The fabric was flowy but not sheer and the pattern is bright and fun.","Super roomy in the top if you arent chesty.","Over-all I would recommend this dress to anyone wanting a fun, casual day dress."
"vacation","I liked some things about this dress and some I didnt.","Pros: fit true to size and flattering, comfortable, soft thick material great for a chilly night in Vegas.","Cons: sleeves were way too long but easily remedied by folding them in, not as short on me as it was on the model, hard to zip up where the satin banding is, zipper was very thick and would create an unattractive puckering at the side that I would have to pull down the dress to get rid of,  mesh cutouts are very small and virtually unnoticeable to others, and none of the detailing shows up in photos.","It looks like a plain black dress in photos, so if you want a dress that stands out in photos, this is not it.","I could not get the banding or mesh to show up both without and with flash.","Other than that, it was a cute dress."
"vacation","Fun and summery dress, super cute and flowy."
"vacation","I liked this dress but it wasnt super flattering on me.","It would probably look great on someone taller and slimmer than me!"
"vacation","Perfect amount of stretch and ruching that hugs every curve, but hides every bump.","Very pretty dress, great for a garden wedding.","Worn with a strapless bra."
"vacation","The neckline (which is sadly hidden in my pic) is just what this simple LBD needs to make it fun and flirty.","I wore this for a night out in Vegas and was SO comfy, yet still felt uber cute!","Highly recommend."
"vacation","Runs a little tight in the bust!"
"vacation","Ive never worn this brand before, but I am a huge fan now.","I wore this for a concert and night out in Vegas.","I love a subtly sexy dress, and this one fit the bill!"
"vacation","Do not order if you have a tum.","Better for tall girls."
"vacation","Love this!","Great vibrant colors.","Fits true to size.","Very comfortable and flattering."
"vacation","Rented this for a vegas vacation and when I tried it on I determined it would be too warm for 80+ degree weather.","The fabric is super comfortable and the dress is beautiful.","Would definately recommend for a winter ocassion."
"vacation","This is a great dress for those who love the Herve dresses, but are on the short side.","It was a great fit and made very well.","I didnt get to wear it for very long, so I might rent it again for another event."
"vacation","This top fit perfectly with no bra, the only con was that if I raised my arms while dancing my boob could have popped out so I kept my movements minimal."
"vacation","The fabric was great because it was thick, but not too heavy for the heat.","It didnt wrinkle or gather like lots of rompers do.","I was happy with the torso length, and I was able to reach the zipper on the back myself- no bathroom assistance required."
"vacation","I rented this in a 6 because it was the only size available.","I am typically a 4, but often order a 6 for slim fitting dresses due to my hourglass shape.","It was too large on the top, so I was unable to wear it.","But, the fabric and design are lovely, so I am considering renting it again in a smaller size for an upcoming vacation or next summer if it is available."
"vacation","It was a little long but 4 inch stilettos finished the look perfectly!!","!"
"vacation","Rented this dress on Unlimited for my trip to Portofino, Italy.","It fit beautifully and was flattering and comfortable, even after eating a large dinner!","I felt elegant and stylish."
"vacation","This dress was comfortable and a pretty blue.","I would purchase this dress if it comes for sale.","It is extremely flattering.","Bra was difficult since it was a low back and cut narrow through the chest.","I wore pasties but a adhesive bra with no back would have been perfect.","Loved it."
"vacation","This dress runs slightly big, but fit very well.","I wore this on vacation in Vegas.","A Thunder from Down Under dancer told me I look like a disco ball, which obviously is the look you are going for with this dress.","It scratched a little under the arms but was very comfortable otherwise.","I loved it!"
"vacation","Way too long for my 52 frame, even with  4 inch heels.","Im 116lbs and the small was too big up top."
"vacation","I rented this beautiful dress for a fun night out in Las Vegas.","It is so sparkly and perfect if you like all eyes on you!","I got many compliments and felt great it in.","However, much like the other sequin dress I ordered, my underarms were raw by the end of the night.","The dress runs a bit large but it was comfortable for dancing.","Overall, Im very happy with this rental!"
"vacation","Wore this to a Chvrches concert in Vegas, PERFECT!!!","It was super comfortable and the perfect length....short but covers everything.","The wrap tie kept coming untied which was a pain and my boobs werent big enough to fill in the size small!","It also smelt a little musty so I was happy to finally take it off."
"vacation","It fit like a glove, was SO comfortable and hugged my curves without bunching, riding up or making my tummy look poufy.","My girlfriends tried it on later and it looked really good on all different body types.","I highly recommend it."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a vacation in Florida which sadly got canceled, so I didnt get to wear it.","However, I did try it on and will absolutely be renting it again!","It fit true to size and was super feminine and figure flattering.","The colors are beautiful and would look even better with a tan!","Cant wait to get somewhere sunny so I can wear this cute dress!"
"vacation","It was very comfortable and flattering.","The best part is that theres no bra required!"
"vacation","This dress is stretchy and was too thick for the weather I was going to wear it in.","Its a nice fit for an hour glass figure."
"vacation","I rented this for my honeymoon but ended up keeping for so much longer.","I really still contemplate buying it.","Yes, its a Lilly shift, but for whatever reason I loved this one."
"vacation","Ended-up wearing the 8, even though Im typically a 10/small 12 in dresses lately.","32FF chest fell out the sides a little bit, but certainly far better than I anticipated.","Didnt think I could wear a bra with this, so went without the first night I wore it, but was able to wear my strapless without issue the second.","This crop top is surprisingly forgiving if youre not totally a crop top-kinda gal (like me!)","Paired with the matching skirt while out to dinner, then with a long, billowy black maxi skirt the next day for a casual lunch.","The material is pleasantly dense; was fine for late spring in Charleston, but Id be a little nervous for summer wear in a humid locale.","The print is really just to die for!!!","Ive rented a lot on here through Unlimited and for formal events, but this is the first outfit Im *seriously* considering purchasing!"
"vacation","This is a really fun dress!","I wore it while vacationing in New York.","It fits true to size and is very comfortable - I literally wore it all day.","Its fairly long, so I would recommend wedges or it will be dragging on the ground.","I would rent this again in a heartbeat!"
"vacation","Sexy, but classy all at the same time.","Will rent again!"
"vacation","This was a stylist pick and I actually ended up wearing it over my pick.","The back is a bit confusing with lots of ties, but one I had it all figured out, it looked amazing!.","The length in the back allows you to wear wedges with it and the light material looked great fluttering in the wind.","My only warning would be you run the risk of some side boob showing, so might not be ideal for busty girls.","Wish I owned this dress!"
"vacation","Definitely rode up a little but less than other rompers.","Was great because it accommodated my butt which is usually tough to do.","Was very short though!"
"vacation","LOVE!","Of all the things Ive rented, this is probably the one Ive loved the most.","Everything about this sweater was amazing.","I rented it for vacation, and I think I ended up wearing it every day.","I wore it on the plane, and people stopped me as I was looking for me seat to compliment me.","I wore it out to dinner, and someone came over from the next table to ask were I got my sweater.","I wore it curled up talking to my family, and my sister and niece kept asking if they could wear it for a bit.","And the whole time I was fielding compliments I was comfortable!","The body of the sweater is oversized, which I liked, as I could wrap in tight when I was cold for cozy warming, or leave it loose to allow airflow.","But the sleeves were fitted, which is turns out is a genius way to make you not look like youre wearing a sack.","The colors and patter went with everything, which was a surprise to me.","It was soft, and surprisingly light weight, kept me plenty warm in 50ish degree temperature.","Im not sure it could get much colder, but Im also a total cold wuss.","I could wear it with leggings, skinny jeans, dresses, or sweats.","I could go on and on, but to sum it up, rent this sweater!","Youll be glad."
"vacation","I actually loved this jumpsuit.","Id love to own it.","Sadly, I didnt get to wear it because of shipping issues.","But I did try it on!"
"vacation","I wore this vest wine tasting on the central CA coast over New Years weekend.","It was perfect - it kept me warm and was casual, yet super chic.","I got tons of compliments- I loved the detachable hood.","I would definitely rent again"
"vacation","I liked this skirt a lot and would wear again for a casual occasion.","I had to go with a size S as XS was not available.","The S was a bit big as I suspected but it worked out to pin it and loop the tie around to make it tighter at my waist.","The fabric is flowy and pretty and the liner helps make sure its not see-through."
"vacation","This is a pretty dress but the size XS was really big in the waist and I am normally a size 6."
"vacation","true to size, lightweight, flowy and super comfortable!","can also be slightly dressed up with jewelry."
"vacation","The fit was amazing, I got tons of complements and felt great.","Highly recommend!","I usually wear a small or xsmall, went with small on this one."
"vacation","this was a pretty, well-made romper.","the color was a bright lime, but not too fluorescent.","My only real issue with it was the fit in the chest area.","you cant really wear a bra with this, which was fine for my 32B chest, but the romper had so much extra fabric/room in the chest that it looked sort of ill fitting and lumpy.","I would think that with a size 0, the chest area would be a bit more fitted.","either way, i wore it twice and liked it:)"
"vacation","This dress is a thicker material and pretty color but it was really big through the bust and arm openings.","It was gaping open on me so I was not able to wear it.","But I did like the dress, color and fabric.","Size down a size it may be perfect."
"vacation","I had originally ordered this dress for a girls night out in Vegas to see Britney Spears.","RTR contacted me a week before the rental to let me know that my dress would not be available, and to pick another few dresses to chose from.","When my order arrived, it turns out that they still sent the backup size of this dress along with the new dress.","Although the new dress looked great as well, I decided to go with this one.","I have to say customer service was A+++ on this!!","Im usually a 6 or an 8, so I originally thought medium would be the best choice for me.","However, I liked the fit of the large.","The dress was very cleavage intensive and rode up quite a bit during the night, but I never felt uncomfortable or exposed.","Im generally not a flashy dresser, but this was the perfect time to go all out!","I would NOT suggest this dress for a wedding, formal gathering or family event, but it is definitely a hot date or night out dress."
"vacation","Fit with plenty of room.","I could have definitely sized down.","The material is very stretchy.","Even with the cutouts I was able to wear a regular bra.","My husband loved the print much more in person.","You wont regret this one!"
"vacation","I rented this romper for a girls trip to Nashville.","It was perfect!","It is so flattering and I got lots of compliments.","I loved that it hugged my body a bit more on the bottom than other rompers - definitely will show off your figure!","The cinched waist was another plus.","I found it fit true to size.","If you are in between sizes, I would recommend going down for a back-up as I tend to go between a 2 and a 4 and wore the 2."
"vacation","The dress runs very small.","I am usually a 12 and even the 14 was very snug and hard to zip.","The sequins are also very scratchy and the dress is heavy.","Color was not even close to the picture."
"vacation","This dress was a great going out dress for Vegas.","I loved the fit and it showed just the right amount of cleavage without being trashy."
"vacation","I rented this for not one but two vacations this summer and wore it regularly to pool parties, the beach and just for everyday.","This may be one of the most comfortable and flattering dresses Ive ever worn!","Would recommend highly!","!"
"vacation","True to size, soft, comfy, and flattering!"
"vacation","This dress, unlike me, is very girly in the best way!","The colors, the fit and the fabric all have a very delicate, flirty feminine feel and using this dress for a bachelorette weekend (and hanging on to it for Easter, the following weekend!)","helped me have a complete wardrobe to choose from.","Love the neckline - you can certainly size down or choose the smaller of the two sizes you pick from because the back has elastic and everything below the chest is a generous fit.","Everyone try this one!"
"vacation","I wore this top while traveling on vacation.","I have a 34F chest...I wore the M, but wish I had ordered a large as there was no stretch in the material."
"vacation","Im 58 and I should have gotten the long instead of the regular length it was a bit high water"
"vacation","This dress was so fun and fabulous!","I got tons of compliments on my birthday and it was perfect for celebrating in Las Vegas.","It was pretty big, I ordered a S and M and ended up wearing the S but I could have worn an XS had I ordered it.","The only negative to this dress is the sequins material really rubs the insides of your arms - I had a lot of red marks the next morning.","Ouch!","Thanks Rent The Runway for making my birthday great!","My friend also rented and wore Herve Leger in this photo."
"vacation","True to size!","Elegant!","Sexy!"
"vacation","It was easy to dress up or down.","I loved it!","the only down side is that it wrinkles pretty easily."
"vacation","Nice fit and a great length - not too short or too long.","Pretty color and print.","Perfect for walking around during the day, but I could have also worn it to work."
"vacation","amazing fit and went with everything i brought for a weekend getaway.","very comfortable and the lining is soft."
"vacation","Fit: Runs small; no zipper in the back so had to squeeze into it (I think a S would be too large on me)Pros: Love the rose gold color of this dressCons: Hair kept sticking to the dress; it was longer than I expected (almost to the top of my knee)Overall, great dress to wear to Vegas."
"vacation","This is the ultimate vacation dress.","I wore it to brunch with sandals and to a nice dinner with heels.","Highly recommend it."
"vacation","This wasnt my favorite rental, but I did get a lot of compliments on it.","The waist kind of hit me oddly--not at my true waist, and not an empire, but it was cute.","True to size."
"vacation","This dress was fun, but very fitted - especially through the waist.","The mesh material is a bit more fishnet like in person and is black while the rest of the dress is navy.","I loved that this was a great fashion forward piece, with a classic silhouette that was sexy without being too flashy.","I rented this for a Vegas weekend with my boyfriends parents so it was important that I didnt get the run of the mill low cut, Vegas sparkly minidress.","Overall, this designer runs a bit small so order a size up.","Not the most comfortable dress ever, but definitely hugs in the right places, with a bit of stretch so you can move and dance just fine.","Wear a strapless bra, or none at all if you can!"
"vacation","I took this dress on vacation and wore it to dinner one night.","Very comfortable pretty dress.","The lace detail in the back makes it a little dressier."
"vacation","Wore this for a night out in Vegas.","It was short but not uncomfortably so, able to walk and move in it.","Looked great!"
"vacation","I wanted to love this dress!","But, being 5 feet tall, it just wasnt the shape for me.","The cut at the chest is strange and made wearing a bra impossible.","Beautiful print though - if I was six inches taller, I think this would have been great!"
"vacation","Normally I would be a size small but this dress is made of the kind of material that really sucks you in so I wore a size XS so that it would be form fitting (I have a small rib cage and small chest so the S was too big up top but it fit nicely over my wider hips -- XS fit the same down below too although it was about an inch shorter).","I got so many compliments all night.","It fit like a glove and the print is amazing.","I highly recommend this for a night out."
"vacation","I adored this dress, plus I got engaged in it, so its extra special!","Despite its tight fit, this dress is quite slimming.","The material is light and stretchy so it was perfect for a tropical climate.","The dress is quite a bit shorter than it appears on the model.","I am 6 and the large hit my mid shin."
"vacation","I didnt bother with a photo, because it was that bad.","The dress fit well and the top was super flattering but the baggy shape just did nothing for my 50 frame.","Still a beautiful dress and if youre a little taller would definitely recommend.","I had my mom try it on to make sure (shes 55) and it looked amazing on her!"
"vacation","This dress fit me perfectly!","I even had random strangers tell me how much they loved my dress, just walking around Las Vegas.","I wore it on two different days, I loved it that much!","I cant wait to buy this."
"vacation","I wore this to Vegas for a Britney Spears concert.","I definitely got a lot of compliments from other ladies.","The only thing I would say is that since it was so shiny, I felt like I looked a little bloated in the midsection, so if youre into spanx it might not be a bad idea to bring a pair.","Definitely a fun dress!"
"vacation","Wore this dress for a trip to Miami, perfect for daytime/pool/beach.","Fits slightly loose and very comfortable."
"vacation","I rented for a trip to Hawaii for a friends wedding.","The color and cutouts are show stopping.","The reviews are accurate that the dress runs small.","I rented a 14 and I normally rent a 12.","While the fabric is stretchy the dress was still tighter than my preference, which would have been ok with a darker color."
"vacation","I rented this dress to wear in California on the beach.","The material feels amazing on and I like the attention to detail.","This dress is flowy I could have gone down another size if I needed to.","If you button all of the buttons, the fit of the dress looks strange so I left a few undone.","Compliments: 1Would I rent again?",": NoHow to style it: with a dress this long, I think some type of heel would look best"
"vacation","I ordered them purposely to go to Spain.","I wore them on the plane and they were perfect.","comfortable, stylish, and fun.","These are by far the best leggings I have ever worn.","When I go the email to buy them and tremendous discount I wasted no time and made the purchase."
"vacation","Loved the color and style of this dress - flirty and fun.","The top is a little awkward, though.","The lines hit right in an awkward spot on your bust, which makes your chest look a little funny.","Couldnt wear a bra with it, but was ok because the fabric was thick enough and the pattern made it so you couldnt see anything."
"vacation","This is a pretty dress.","The fabric was a wonderful silky fabric with a fair amount of strength.","I was surprised by how big it ran.","I could belt it, but the dress would look much better if it was more fitted rather than big.","I am between a 22 and 20 and I normally size up, but I could have used the 20 in this instance.","Customer service was very helpful."
"vacation","Rented this as part of unlimited for a Caribbean cruise vacation.","The tags were still on the blouse when it arrived and I wore it twice I loved it so much!","Very comfortable.","I wore a strapless bra with it since the fabric is light and even thought its lined, my nipples were visible without.","The color is deep turquoise and the flutter detail is so pretty.","I would definitely rent again!"
"vacation","This dress is very pretty!","I wore it to a New Years Eve dinner in Vegas.","The 4 was a bit tight in the rib cage so I wore the 6 and it was big in the top.","I had to use fabric tape in the v and pinned it in the back.","However I loved the dress and how comfortable it was."
"vacation","This is my perfect summer dress - a great print, a flattering fit, and both comfortable and stylish!","I received so many compliments on this dress and I felt great wearing it.","I am tall and the small fit well and was plenty long - this would probably be too long on anyone under about 56 or so."
"vacation","The bust area is lose.","I wish I would have gone down a size in general.","The dress runs large."
"vacation","beautiful dress but runs small"
"vacation","Perfect fit.","wore the XS.","It was very comfortable and I did not have any issues with it.","I wore it to dinner."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a Vegas trip and was a bit overwhelmed by the attention it caused.","fit wise, It was a little big on me, the xs wasnt available so I took my chances and rented the small which I ended up belting at the waist to give it some definition.","I dont think Ive ever gotten as many compliments in one night as I did wearing this dress.","It was a little overwhelming, other reviewers were NOT lying when they said all eyes are on you in this dress.","Very true, so much so that I ended up changing my outfit after dinner.","It was still a night, and a dress that I will never forget!"
"vacation","im typically a 4 and the small fit w plenty of room to spare.","it fits a little like a shift dress, so even though theres no stretch, i have a large waist and i fit the small with plenty of room.","in hindsight the XS may have helped w the strap issues i had.","when i move around or even shrug, the straps would fall off, which made it difficult to wear comfortably, but i still wore it because the dress is so so so cute!","the color and pattern are great and it was flattering.","i didnt bother with a bra since there was plenty of support."
"vacation","Beautiful maxi that I rented for a recent vacation.","The color and cut of the dress is incredibly flattering and beautiful.","I got so many compliments.","Only downside is the dress does run a little big and is very long.","If you are a tall gal - this is your maxi dress!","Im 5/7 and unfortunately this dress dragged on the ground a lot.","Great otherwise!"
"vacation","Sorry- the picture sucks!","This dress fits true to size, I didnt need a bra (could easily wear a strapless), slits on either side of the bottom makes it extremely comfy and perfect for a tropical vacation!","The pattern/color is beautiful, I thought it would look more dressy, but definitely fits the relaxed maxi description.","Definitely recommend"
"vacation","This was the PERFECT black dress.","It accented all of my curves.","It was definitely a head turning dress.","The only thing is, for me, I have very athletic and muscular legs and a big bottom, the dress was right around the thighs and butt.","I will absolutely rent this dress again though!"
"vacation","A little boxy but overall a nice cool weather dress to wear to a casual event.","I wore it to brunch in NYC, dressed up with a nice leather jacket and ankle boots."
"vacation","I had been eyeing this skirt for some time now and I am SO GLAD I rented it for a recent bachelorette weekend.","I wore it for a day of walking around downtown.","It was a little snug in the waist but since I wore it high it fit just fine.","I dressed it down but the skirt could easily be dressed up.","This skirt was amazing - I will definitely be renting it again and again."
"vacation","Runs large, normally wear a Medium and ended up wearing the Small and it fit perfectly!"
"vacation","I recently went to Vegas for a wedding and this dress was perfect for seeing the sights in the daytime.","Its true to size, flowy and no fuss."
"vacation","I loved this jacket, it fit perfectly and wasnt too boxy for my small frame.","I got lots of compliments all night long.","The detailing on the jacket is phenomenal!","Looks great with black leggings or skinny jeans too."
"vacation","Brightened up vacation; comfortable and fit well; needs a heeled sandal or wedge to get the best look at my height 55"
"vacation","This dress is very comfortable!","Its light and airy, but not see thru.","This is a midi dress length with thin spaghetti straps.","The tie waist gives the dress some shape on your body.","I ordered the 38R and it fit me well (Im very petite).","You could go bra less or use a strapless bra.","I would recommend for vacation or a causal event!"
"vacation","This was my mainstay evening wear during a vacation abroad this summer.","I wore it with simple leather thong sandals and sometimes a necklace.","The wrap style is very flattering.","I wore an XS only because the S wasnt available - and so it was a bit snug for me through the sleeves, but the bodice part was great.","Shows of the décolletage really beautifully.","I packed some wardrobe double sided tape which is nice for the plunging V of the neckline.","It kept it just in the right place and my bra didnt show.","The fabric didnt wrinkle very much, despite being repeatedly folded back into my suitcase as we went from place to place.","Wish I had photos - it is really a lovely piece!"
"vacation","Fit great with side zip to keep waist visible."
"vacation","I wore this dress on a trip to Spain.","I thought the pattern was beautiful and the dress was unique.","I thought the dress was a bit fitted in the bottom but otherwise I was happy with this rental."
"vacation","wore this with gladiator heels and felt amazing!","im only a 34B so got away not wearing a bra, but any larger youll want a NuBra for it.","super comfortable and flirty!"
"vacation","The other user reviews were super helpful.","As others mentioned, I found that it runs a little large.","I usually wear a size 6 but ordered a size 4 as a backup - so glad I did as it was the one I ended up wearing.","The detailing is fab but was hard for me to catch in my photos (zoomed in on one of the pics to try and capture).","Very comfortable, too!"
"vacation","I loved this top.","A little sheer, but I liked being outside my comfort zone.","I paired with white jeans+bright pink high heeled sandals and thought I looked great."
"vacation","The dress does have a back zip that makes the bodice more form fitting than the pic portrays.","It is a lovely dress I wore to a day party in a vineyard and was very pleased!","!"
"vacation","This dress was fun to wear!","The neckline was a little higher than I would have liked, probably could have worn the small.","The cotton fabric was super lightweight, but the pattern kept it from being see-through."

"vacation","perfect for my beach vacation.","looked faded but i think that was how the dress was designed.","i wore it as a cover up and to a laid back dinner."
"vacation","Loved the dress but it runs very large.","I am 57 and normally a 2/4.","I sized down to a 0 which fit great but was still very long.","I wore with 3.5 inch heels so it didnt touch the ground but if you are short I would steer clear of this dress."
"vacation","Great jumpsuit!","I typically wear a 2R and followed others advice to size up, and am happy that I did because the 4R fit perfect.","The cut-outs hit at the perfect spot, and overall it was very comfortable to wear.","My boyfriend loved it as well and he doesnt always like different outfits like this.","I highly recommend it!"
"vacation","I rented this dress for family pictures for my parents 40th wedding anniversary and then again to take on vacation with me.","Very on trend with the cut outs yet still conservative."
"vacation","I loved this romper and wanted to wear it so badly, but it was too large!","Im 56 and the length of the pant was great.","I wear a size 4 pant and the waste of this romper was too big and slumped down below my waste.","Ill get a smaller size next time I have an opportunity to wear something like this!"
"vacation","The fit was a bit tighter than I expected, probably because the sequins are clingy.","Also shorter and more low-cut than I anticipated (but that was fine for Vegas!)","Definitely need to weak Spanx to smooth things out.","Otherwise, it was comfortable and fun for a long night out."
"vacation","Great quality, very sexy, true to size"
"vacation","I absolutely loved this dress.","I rented the 6 without getting my usual 4 as a back up, and although it was a tad loose in my waist area you couldnt tell as the material is stretchy and flattering no matter what.","I would say it runs true to size.","It was so comfortable and easy to move and dance in.","I definitely recommend this dress!"
"vacation","Great top, but I think the one I received needs to be retired...."
"vacation","I absolutely adore this dress!","Unfortunately, I rented it to wear to a dinner on a beach vacation and it was just a bit too formal.","The good news, though, is that I now have a favorite dress and I cant wait to rent it again!","It would be the perfect dress for a nice dinner or a fall / winter wedding.","The purple color is even prettier in person and the waist is incredibly fitted and flattering.","My only word of caution is that the arms run REALLY small."
"vacation","As others have mentioned, it runs a little large on top.","If youre flat-chested, Id advise sizing down."
"vacation","This dress is so cute!","Very comfortable and trendy.","The waist band & top are very stretchy so I think each size would have fit the same, really.","I wish I could have kept this one, I could see myself wearing it all the time!","The fabric is flowy and light, very nice for warmer weather.","Definitely recommend this dress!"
"vacation","Rented this dress with my unlimited subscription for a trip to Bermuda.","It definitely turned some heads.","The dress is soft and comfortable, and the tie top is great for adjusting to your chest size (Im pretty small on top, so being able to make the bust not baggy was a big plus).","I did feel like this dress was a bit tight in the midsection, and had a little trouble zipping it up.","But once I zipped I was good to go."
"vacation","Wonderful dress that is very slimming, however very short!","I almost did not wear it due to the length, but my boyfriend liked so I gave it a try and am glad I did because I was complimented all night long!"
"vacation","The shoulder pads were really puffy which me look like I had big shoulders.","I rented with my unlimited so I sent it back right away and did not wear it out.","The material was sturdy and color very pink."
"vacation","Fits great, thick fabric with a lot of stretch.","I liked this dress a lot and highly recommend."
"vacation","Beautiful dark green color.","Very soft leather.","Next time, will get a bigger size just to be able to layer.","Its actually pretty heavy and very warm.","Comfortable for air travel."
"vacation","The fit was okay, I would of been able to wear the 8 but the lace around the arms and shoulders was just too tight.","That would be the only con on this dress.","I did not wear a bra since it comes with cups in it already."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a Birthday Cruise I was on.","I was a bit nervous since it had no reviews.","It came with tags on.","The dress runs large for sure.","I am usually a 4 but when choosing between a small and a medium I usually pick a medium since I have a bottom and broad shoulders.","The dress was big pretty much all over.","I belted it and pinned it to make it more fitted in the waist.","Overall I loved it the more I wore it throughout the night.","I love that it is at an inexpensive price point as well."
"vacation","Fit was on the small side but wearable.","Too warm-better for winter or fall.","Did not wear"
"vacation","The button didnt stay close with a large bust.","That clasp was too weak so, I threw on a pretty bra and pearls, to help."
"vacation","Fits well.","Be prepared because it is short!"
"vacation","Has an interesting, dramatic cut, which is very flattering.","High fashion without being hard-edged.","Fabric is a little lighter and less luxurious than Id like, but on the bright side it makes it good for hot weather."
"vacation","unique print, stretchy material that is very flattering ,not too short"
"vacation","Runs small in the chest area, if you are full busted, also I was 10 weeks pregnant in this photo, be a little swollen might have had something to do with that."
"vacation","Fit is perfect and comfortable.","Only concern is the cutout under chest area.","Felt a little odd and would fold out and reveal black material at times."
"vacation","Ive always wanted a Lilly Pulitzer dress and finally had the opportunity to rent one for my recent Florida vacation.","This dress is fabulous!","If you want to channel the 60s, turn heads and exude a tropical, beach vibe, this is the number.","Just be aware: Its SHORT.","I rented the 2 because the 4 wasnt available and had to be very, very careful about sitting, bending, etc.","The four may have worked better.","At any rate: have great legs and be willing to show them!"
"vacation","Great shoulder width, love the length, great for tall girls.","Fabric is light but not see-through.","Loved!","!"
"vacation","Its a loose fitting trapeze style dress that looks great dressed up or down.","Im a 34 B and had to be conscious of my bra poking out as it does shift a little.","Its a heavier fabric but still felt light and cool in 100 degree heat.","Overall its definitely a piece Id love to add to my permanent collection."
"vacation","I normally wear a size 6.","I rented the S and XS and ended up wearing the XS.","The S landed at my waist better, but the top was way too big so I had to go with the XS.","The top is very loose.","I loved the open, sexy back, but had to be careful not to flash anyone.","You might want to use fabric tape or something to keep the front secure.","Loved the soft material.","And pockets!","Was perfect for my beach vacation."
"vacation","This is a very classy but sexy dress."
"vacation","Fit was perfect.","Comfortable.","Flattering.","Would absolutely wear this one again!"
"vacation","This dress is sexy & was figure flattering on me, however; it was just a bit shorter than Im comfortable wearing.","This was my backup dress, so I didnt wear it."
"vacation","the fit was more of like a boyfriend style.","very loose and flowy"
"vacation","Recommend sizing up if you have broader shoulders or need a little more space typically in the arm area in button down shirts.","No stretch in the material.","If you are really thin, this may run big."
"vacation","This jacket is incredible.","I wore it all over Europe and Canada while traveling and just absolutely fell in love with its effortless style and incredible warmth and comfort.","I hope it sticks around to next winter because Ill definitely rent it again!"
"vacation","I normally wear a small, but a medium in Alexis tops fits me perfect."
"vacation","The dress was quite low cut for a large chest, but the dress was very flattering!"
"vacation","The loose cut, off-shoulder neckline, and horizontal stripe combine to make this a rather unflattering look.","Didnt end up wearing."
"vacation","Loved this romper once I got it on, but I needed my friends help to do it!","Zipper is a bit flimsy and the back buttons up.","It also wrinkles super easily.","BUT the print is adorable and I got so many compliments!"
"vacation","Absolutely love this dress!","The whole night I received compliments on how chic and fabulous the dress looked.","Fit amazing around the butt area and the material was amazing."
"vacation","Im 53.. and about 140 lbs.","this dress made me look great!!","Its very short- but holds everything in perfectly.","It looked great with a tan..","I think its perfect fun sexy flirty dress.","Wore it out to the club."
"vacation","Loved this dress.","It ran a little large, so I would recommend ordering a size up.","Its perfect with a wedge or a sandal depending on the occasion.","I wore it on a trip to the cost of Italy, it packed really well and wore well also."
"vacation","I was apprehensive about a jumpsuit since I have never worn one before.","I ordered the size 2 & 4 and ended up going with 2 because I wanted it tight enough that I wouldnt worry about it sliding down.","It definitely was snug - no bending over possible - but comfortable enough to wear through dinner, a broadway show, and drinks afterward.","Theres nothing overly striking about the outfit itself so you can take it ANY direction with statement accessories - shoes, jewelry or a great bag.","I paired a RTR necklace with it!"
"vacation","love this dress.","very flattering fit.","I never wear yellow (Im fair/blond) but this looked great even with my complexion.","highly recommend.","I think this dress would look great on most figures."
"vacation","Cute, comfortable and easy to wear.","The fabric is nice  - I expected it to be more cotton/casual but its a lightweight synthetic material (its nice, I dont know how to describe it) that makes it feel a little nicer than just a cotton sun dress.","I wore this to work and took it on vacation to Hawaii - its pretty versatile.","The shape is forgiving and it fit well.","The only area that was a little tight was under the arms, but it was not so tight as to be uncomfortable.","A good all-around dress rental, with low risk that it wont fit."
"vacation","Do not wear a bra.","I repeat, do not wear a bra.","Either dont wear a bra or buy nipple covers.","other than that, this dress will draw attention onto yourself because the the plunge is that deep and wide."
"vacation","I wore this dress to a wedding and it looked fabulous!","Im 112 lbs 34 B-C and the 4 fit the best.","The 6 was huge in the boob area.","The dress was a bit snug in the ribcage.","I would recommend hollywood tape as the straps are not adjustable.","I accessorized with a triple strand of pearls and black peep toe pumps.","Material was interesting and it did not wrinkle.","The dress was a hit!"
"vacation","Love this girly fun dress!","I paired it with a belt.","SO cute!"
"vacation","I wore this on a recent trip to Vegas.","It stood out even with all the other flashy dresses.","I loved that I could rent this and return it because this is not a dress I would wear at home!","It fit great - definitely had some give.","It was VERY short.","Some sequins were missing - but not noticeable.","Overall - I would definitely rent again for a similar occasion."
"vacation","I rented this romper from the RTR Vegas store for a night out on the strip with my hubby.","I felt like a million bucks wearing it.","For the large chested women: remember your fashion tape!!","!"
"vacation","I rented this dress for an upcoming vacation.","The print and colors are so fun - theyre tropical but also stand out from typical floral prints.","Unfortunately the fit of the dress was funny on my.","Its loose fitting (I had to belt the waist to add shape) but then tight through the bust."
"vacation","I wore this dress for a classy night out in Vegas and it was a hit!","I got so many compliments and I felt fantastic in it!","As the stylist notes recommend, if youre looking for something thats loosely fitted like the model, size up.","Im typically an 8 and this dress was a bit fitted.","That being said, it was very flattering.","One thing to note is that if youre going to be spending a lot of time sitting (as I was at dinner), consider renting a different dress.","The lining on this dress does not run the full length of the dress (it ends about an inch from the bottom) and therefore exposes your skin to scratchy sequins on the hem, making sitting quite uncomfortable.","Overall, I highly recommend this dress as long as you dont mind sacrificing some comfort!"
"vacation","I love Shoshanna dresses, so I was excited when this more casual style came up on my email.","I rented it for a wine tasting day and it was great.","Usually I wear an 8 in Shoshanna but the top part of this dress ran a bit small and lacked stretch, so I went with the 10.","I am only 52 so I did wish it was a little shorter, but thats not really an issue with the dress.","I got a lot of compliments and was very comfortable all day.","The way the skirt lays makes it very susceptible to catching the wind, but I quite enjoyed playing Marilyn."
"vacation","It was flowy and roomy.","But like most rompers, it takes a minute when youve got to unbutton every time you go to the restroom.","Im tall, and this was just on the verge of being too short in the torso, but I made it work.","Super cute color and very comfortable."
"vacation","It was a great blazer to have on hand instead of a jacket/coat.","Warm enough without being too bulky and added a bit of wow factor to simple dressed down outfits.","I would def.","rent this again!"
"vacation","Mara Hoffman stuff is a bit loose for my tastes, but this made the perfect beach vacation cover-up.","It does wrinkle easily so I wouldnt plan on taking it to wear to a dinner or anything other than poolside."
"vacation","I wore this on vacation and got soo many compliments.","It could be dressed down with espadrilles for day and dressed up with heels for night.","It was lightweight and breathable but the lace was still thick and intricate.","It fit perfectly.","Love, love, love!"
"vacation","Got a ton of compliments and loved wearing it!"
"vacation","Garment is well made.","I did not want to wear shorts every day, so this was a nice way to dress up a casual affair.","I wore them with a black tank top and cute black wedges.","I got lots of compliments on them.","They are comfortable to wear.","I think the taller or more long waisted you are the better with these."
"vacation","This dress was really pretty, and a perfect choice for a special dinner on vacation or an outdoor summer wedding.","It is more on the casual side, so if you are going to a more upscale wedding or formal event you may want to go with another choice.","I did really like how the top fits because you do not need to wear a bra with it.","Unfortunately one of the straps was broken when the dress arrived, however RTRs customer service was amazing per usual and they overnight shipped me another dress which I actually ended up liking even better.","Overall very pretty dress!"
"vacation","This dress felt very well made and was comfortable in addition to really fun to wear.","Its short and fitted, but still glamorous.","I felt like the dress ran a little small in the waist and a little tight in the bust, but not so much that it was unwearable."
"vacation","This fit perfectly.","I wore this out in Key West and it was cool and breezy for the hot weather, just the right amount of skin showing without being overly revealing.","It would be great with heels and jewelry to dress it up, or throw on flats for a more casual look."
"vacation","Loved the fit and feel of this shirt dress.","Wore it to dinner while on vacation in Maine.","It was perfect for the cooler nights.","I thought the tie waist was very flattering."
"vacation","Fit great and super comfortable.","The slits are a little higher than I expected so I felt like when I walked my legs were super exposed.","Otherwise, great dress"
"vacation","Very flattering and true to size.","Was right at my knee, at 52."
"vacation","Very tight in hips for someone that doesnt have wide hips at all"
"vacation","Wore this out in Vegas and received tons of compliments.","The only problem is i have long hair and i curled it this night and it kept getting caught in the sequins.","IT was hard to dance and move."
"vacation","Loved the dress.","Wore it for a girls trip in Savannah.","Great fabric, thick and concealing.","Love the detail of the tie and the stitching down the sides.","Im tall (510) and this was still a great length."
"vacation","This dress has a very flowy relaxed fit, and hit at about ankle length.","I absolutely loved this dress!","While on vacation...","I wore it as a beach cover up, out to a nice dinner, and for a relaxed day on the boardwalk.","I am not one to typically re-wear an outfit over and over on a week long vacation, but it looked that good."
"vacation","Not able to wear a bra with this one, and Im a modest 34b so its not like I usually have this problem.","Size up, its a cute vacation dress if you can get your boobs into it and breathe."
"vacation","Tall girls order the long or plan to wear flats and those that are small chested fashion tape is a must!"
"vacation","Now I am not skinny (195 lbs at 59) and no super model, but I felt like one in this dress.","I also got the 16L and was able to wear the 14L for my size and height.","I could do the 14R next time, but I did like the formal feel of my dress dragging on the floor with my High heels.","I did not trip, but I will just get the 14R next time for all my dresss.","True fit.","During the week of Cursing I had 3 dresss on board, ladies night after night were waiting to see my next fabulous dress all from Rent the Runway.","What a great experience and hope this comes to Canada in the near future.","Thank you for making me feel beautiful."
"vacation","There is no stretch to the dress but the medium fit just fine.","Didnt wear bra with dress but it worked out.","Felt great for a nice dinner!"
"vacation","Loved this jacket.","I got numerous compliments just walking around Vegas.","Not too heavy.","Was a bit bulky and not the most flexible garment...but def worth it."
"vacation","I will definitely order this again throughout the winter season.","Beautiful shimmer to it."
"vacation","I thought this would be too short on me and had I not been daring enough to try this for my vacation (at my age, the short stuff just isnt awesome...) but after a bit of a tan I was surprised to see how much I liked this and it wasnt as short as it looks on the model (Im 59).","Got a few compliments including one from my husband."
"vacation","Great dress and so comfortable!","I got the small and the medium but ended up wearing the medium, the small was a bit snug after drinking and eating for two days straight before I had to wear it!"
"vacation","Sorry ~ I am the most unphotogenic person but the dress was so fun & flattering that I needed to post!","I am 50 and usually a size 10 but was told the day it was shipping the 10 did not come back so they were sending the 8.","No problem there ~ it fit & was so so comfortable.","Kind of stretchy a bit & not constricting at all.","I would rent again in a heart beat!","Loved it :)"
"vacation","Definitely runs small.","I typically wear a 4 or 6 in most dresses, and the 6 fit like a glove.","If my bust was any bigger (Im 57, 145#, and 32C), the 6 would not have fit.","The lining was nice and hid any panty lines or anything else.","I felt fabulous in this dress - highly recommend it!"
"vacation","I definitely stood out in this dress.","Must wear sticky boobs though.","There is no support in the front."
"vacation","The colors on this dress are much more vibrant in person then in photos, definite plus.","It also runs a bit short and a bit small so size up one.","Perfect for most spring time events"
"vacation","Lots of compliments and can be dressed up for work, or worn casual on vaca."
"vacation","I am 6 months pregnant and rented this for a weekend away.","Even with my growing belly size small was huge.","I could have easily worn an XS.","It was also very long.","Im 58 and it dragged on the ground.","But it was a gorgeous color and the fabric was light and cool in the hot weather."
"vacation","It is a bit short, I ordered up a size and it was perfectly appropriate for work with black tights!"
"vacation","Very form fitting.","I did not wear a bra and everything stayed in place.","I think this dress has probably been rented a lot so the colors didnt quite pop as much as I thought they would.","Still enjoyed the dress and will most likely order from this line again."
"vacation","Fit true to size.","The top is asymmetrical which is a little awkward, but overall a great dress and I would rent it again."
"vacation","Really loved this skirt for vacation!","Im 52 so its floor length on me, much longer than on the model.","It has an elastic waist so its very comfortable.","The XS wasnt available so I rented a Small.","I would have preferred XS because there is quite a bit of fabric and like I said was very long, so I think XS would have been more flattering.","But it still worked even in the larger size!"
"vacation","Very comfortable form fitting, backless dress with eye-catching graphic print.","Had no issues with gaping sleeves or with the skirt riding up.","Loved wearing it - hated sending it back!"
"vacation","Loved this dress!!","The fit was great.","Super flattering.","The top does all the right things for the girls.","Bra definitely optional.","I have an extremely short torso which is always a concern with dresses but this dress fit perfectly.","Thick material,  true to size.","My fiancé was very happy with my choice for our fancy night out in Vegas"
"vacation","Different then any other dress I have worn.","Wore it in Hawaii with a big hat and red lips and sandals.","Got compliments, it was fun and the fabric is cotton so it is cool"
"vacation","I wore this dress for a trip to Philadelphia with my daughters.","It is the perfect summer dress - light and airy.","It can be dressed up or down.","It was slightly dressy for what we were doing (touring the city) but not out of place.","However, it would have also been fine for a more formal event.","I loved the fit and look of the dress, but the halter straps were very thin and they were the primary support, which meant that after a while they cut into my neck.","The discomfort was worth it, though!"
"vacation","Wore this dress to Opera in Paris.","I was hesitant when I ordered, but it was an incredible dress.","Fit perfect and was incredibly comfortable.","Looks so much better in person when you can see the detail.","It was Christmas and the dress was perfect for the chilly night.","Felt like a million!"
"vacation","I got this in a size 0 for a friends wedding - weekend in New Orleans and it was fantastic!","Im 53 105lbs 34b 25 waist and 33 hips and felt like it was a touch loose but that was fine cause it made for a super comfortable dress!","It is more fitted in the bust and hips and the waist area is loose, i think thats just the way the dress is supposed to fit though.","Its the perfect combo of classy and sexy without being too over the top.","Id definitely would rent this again for a cocktail party.","I styled this with gold pumps and a gold clutch and simple earrings - the dress itself is a total statement piece so I just let it shine on its own.","The color is a vibrant gorgeous blue - I mustve had 15 people compliment me on the streets so its a definite head turner if youre looking to be noticed and remembered!"
"vacation","It was very tight!","I am 54 and weigh 130 and I wore a 6 but could have even gone with an 8."
"vacation","The fit was tight in the top and showed too much cleavage for my taste.","The fit was loose in the waist."
"vacation","Loved this dress.","Very flattering and not see through.","Very comfortable.","I would rent again!"
"vacation","This was a fun dress I rented for my Vegas trip, but I didnt end up wearing it (I did a rent one get three deal).","It was a bit tight and short, and I felt self-conscious in it because it felt overly sexy.","I think if there was a larger size (XL) available, I wouldve been super happy with it.","Also, the zipper tends to get stuck in the back fairly easily."
"vacation","I wore this dress to dinner while I was on vacation at Disneyland.","It is certainly a vibrant dress and I got compliments.","Im not sure it is entirely flattering on a larger person, but it was unique.","The chest area was a little tight, but I have a large ribcage.","It could be a problem for those with larger chests."
"vacation","Didnt end up wearing this because the skirt didnt fit properly"
"vacation","I wore this dress to Australia.","It didnt travel super well but a quick iron later and it was much less wrinkled.","I paired it with lily gold wedges.","My husband loved it.","Definitely recommend for C+ cup because the v neck is very flattering."
"vacation","This dress turns heads!","It is super luxe and comfortable too.","I loved it so much, RTR came through yet again!!","it is fully lined inside with pale pink fabric.","The quality is really there as well as the design.","I loved the little red heart on the left side - very subtle but interesting detail.","If you want to stir up some trouble, wear this dress :)  It will fit any body type probably, curvy as well as tall and boyish.","Im pretty busty and size 10 was just fine.","Ive had many, many really terrific finds on RTR, but this one is one of the TOPS!!","!"
"vacation","I was hesitant until I put it on.","Very fun and flattering.","I received compliments all night on the town in Chicago.","Did size up as recommended."
"vacation","I wore this dress for a night out in Vegas.","I was not a huge fan.","First, the pros: the beading is beautiful and it is definitely built for someone with curves.","Cons: the lining would NOT stay put.","The class and elegance of this dress was lost on me because I was constantly tugging on the two lining layers."
"vacation","Loved this dress.","Would rent it again.","Super comfortable, and super flattering.","Disappointed I didnt take a picture."
"vacation","Fit: True to size, though the top portion is loose.","The button kept coming out.","Overall, very comfortable to wear and the color is great for summer"
"vacation","loved this shirt and got a lot of compliments!","The sleeves were a little short so I would size up if your tall (or have long arms).","Very colorful and breezy.","Perfect for vacation or a BBQ."
"vacation","Absolutely adorable."
"vacation","Very pretty, worn for out of town venue."
"vacation","What more could a girl want than a sparkly dress when going to Vegas!","This dress was the perfect Vegas dress.","It did get a little scratchy under my arms, but other than that, it was a perfect fit!"
"vacation","definitely runs large, I could have likely worn a smaller size.","Due to the shape of the sweater, it didnt make a big difference."
"vacation","I wore this for a trip to Napa.","It was a great dress to wear in the heat.","The leg openings made the air flow, also gave it a ton of character.","The top part was a little tight but it zipped and didnt rip.","Colors and pattern were great too, nothing too over the top."
"vacation","Fit true to size, love the draping on the back"
"vacation","The dress fits great and almost acts as its own spanx, but the shoulders dont stay down very well."
"vacation","Having loved my previous jumpsuit rental from RTR, I decided to try another for Memorial Day Weekend in Vegas.","This was the perfect way to kick off summer.","The top and waist fit very snug, but the legs were a little roomy as you can tell in the picture.","I have skinny legs though, so if you have muscular legs youll fill them out perfectly.","I wore a nude strapless bra.","Would rent again come summertime!"
"vacation","Was too short to wear.","I am 58 and it showed my butt cheeks."
"vacation","It is very in  item but if it is hot outside the long sleaves will not work and when its cold the shorts dont seem  adequate"
"vacation","Fit well, was flattering.","I like that it is short and not too tight in the midsection.","I would definitely rent again!"
"vacation","Had the formula for a great fit: great above knee length and a little side boob, plus was flattering because it was loose around the mid-section.","It was the perfect dress for dinner during by vacation, I even wore in again 2 nights later because I loved this dress."
"vacation","Perfect fit.","Im 59  with a long torso so length can be tricky!","But this fit me amazingly.","I was definitely a head turner.","The lace detail on the arms and back is gorgeous and adds to the LBD"
"vacation","The dress looks beautiful in person and flows very well.. Got great pictures on our vacation to the Bahamas and received tons of compliments.","Felt like a celebrity, turning heads as I walked past.","Beautiful Beautiful dress, might end up buying it.","Its very comfortable as well."
"vacation","Ran a little small in the top but overall fit well.","Heavy material.","Loved it so much I wanted to wear in the daytime but its too formal."
"vacation","This was a backup dress for a Napa weekend getaway, and it was my favorite!","The colors and pattern are brighter and sexier in person, and the silk breathed beautifully on a hot day.","Its very low-cut, which I loved, but there is a clasp to make it more modest if you want (my husband was like nooooooo leave it open).","The decorative buttons didnt make sense to me and I think the dress would be better without them, but its a perfect dress for wine tasting, date night, or any event."
"vacation","I wish I had a better picture of this dress because I honestly had so much fun in it!","I wore it on the last night of a vacation in Turks and Caicos and it was great for both a semi formal dinner and a night full of dancing afterwards.","The dress has a lot of fabric, so Id recommend sizing down.","Also when you wear it, be sure to really tie the dress (kind of tight) around your neck - it looks much cuter that way.","All in all, this was a very fun dress for a vacation evening out!"
"vacation","The top on the left side (from shoulder to collarbone) did not lay flat."
"vacation","I absolutely love this dress!","The fabric has a little stretch and fit my smaller waist/bigger booty in a way that is hard to find in clothing!","Its a very flattering shape, and surprisingly comfy to wear.","I will definitely be renting this dress again."
"vacation","This is beautifully made!","It was not flattering to my 54 curvy figure.","The sides hung very low so wearing a bra was not an option for me.","I might have been able to go down a size but am on unlimited so I only go the one size."
"vacation","flattering & dont need a bra!","the perfect dress :)"
"vacation","Fit really well.","Only thing was the zipper kinda made a funny roll if I stood a certain way.","Wasnt that noticeable, though."
"vacation","Pretty and mod with a unique pattern.","Flattering cut and color.","Comfortable but also cute.","Wore to a winery in summer.","Liked the lace detail on the front.","Great length, even for shorter gals."
"vacation","Yes its short and tight but its constructed very well and sucks everything together in all the right spots"
"vacation","Let me tell you--this dress is the absolute best rental Ive ever had from RTR to date.","The fit was perfect, the print was to die for, and the style is edgy and cute and sexy at the same time.","It was perfect for a 24/7 shindig: conference during the day, cocktail party in the afternoon, and the bar at night.","I got sooooo many compliments on this dress.","I wore the skirt a second time on my vacation with a different brightly colored crop top and it worked amazing."
"vacation","Its heavier than I expected it to be - material wise, but with that you cannot see through it.","Im smaller on top ( 34b) with wide hips and a butt, the top was too big and the bottom was tight.","Hard to find the perfect romper with my body type but overall good."
"vacation","I wore this dress on a vacation in Napa, CA.","It was a little overcast, so the thicker material was perfect.","I loved the fact that you had a lot of control over the fit.","The dress has ties around the waist so you can synch it up to show off your waist, or wear it loose and comfy.","You also have control over how deep the V goes in the front, it is controlled by a series of hook and eyes."
"vacation","I wore this dress to an evening party while on vacation.","It was perfect!","The dress fell to just the right length on my legs.","I never felt like it was too short or that I needed to tug it down.","The fabric is very soft, and the way the sleeves hold their shape is very flattering.","I received many compliments from ladies asking me where I got it from!"
"vacation","As the other reviews have said, it was indeed pretty tight in the bust, so I couldnt wear a normal bra... had to go with a lightweight nude sports bra to be comfortable.","It does kind of fit like a bag, but in a cute, breezy way.","Wouldnt buy and probably wont rent again, but thats what I love about my Unlimited!"
"vacation","I was 34 weeks pregnant when I wore this dress.","Ordered it for babymoon and ended up wearing it as bathing suit cover as the area around the bump was a little tight.","It is a buttoned down dress and at one place there was slight spreading of the fabric (where my bump is biggest).","The material is super light and soft--perfect for warm weather:)  Looks great with sandals!"
"vacation","I loved that this dress was sort of on the side of conservative from the front, but has flowy short skirt and a fun back.","Perfect for the occasions when you cant decide if you should dress up or down, because it works as both!"
"vacation","he cut-outs were not too big and looked flattering.","If you have a very large bust, size up.","If the dress had been any smaller, the bottom of my bra might have been visible in the cut-outs.","I really liked the neckline and the color.","The bottom of the dress was not form-fitting enough.","There was a big gap of space between my knee and the where the dress fell, making it look a little more boring and less sexy.","I wanted to wear it for a night out in Vegas but chose not to because if the poor fit in the legs.","This sizing issue may have been due to the fact that I had to size-up to accommodate my large bust."
"vacation","Wore it with ankle jeans - cute look.","Glad I rented it on my Unlimited subscription.","Cute but not worth the money to buy."
"vacation","Perfect!","I wore this on vacation!","Super fun and casual but can also be dressed up!","Loved it!","I normally wear a medium but the small fit me better."
"vacation","Cant wait to rent this in pink!"
"vacation","I am 55 and 36C, and short wasted.","This was a perfect fit.","It stores well, no ironing required.","This was a perfect selection for a cruise vacation.","Casual, but unusual.","Very trendy.","Loved the compliments.","Short waisted girls will love the fit.","Very fitted but I wore the size 8, and it fit very well."
"vacation","This dress was so HOTT!","I love the open back and the color on the front of the dress.","The sleeves are kindof funky.","They are like a bell capped sleeve, but trust me no one will pay attention to the detail of the sleeve in this dress."
"vacation","This dress fit very well.","If you have a larger bust be aware you will show all of your inside cleavage since the see through lace is very low cut.","But I felt comfortable enough to pull it off since I was in Las Vegas.","So I would say it depends on the occasion and what you are personally okay with showing.","Overall a fun dress to wear!","I was worried the skirt would be too short but it was perfect in length."
"vacation","Beautiful"
"vacation","I wore this to a music festival in NYC and got photographed by a womens lifestyle magazine!","Loved wearing this.","Great length on the shorts and the sleeves were very fun."
"vacation","Wore this for a weekend getaway with the hubby.","I am almost 8 months pregnant (gained about 18 pounds) and normally wear a size xs (pre-pregnancy).","Ordered a M and wore with maternity leather leggings.","Looked chic for a contemporary dinner and was comfy.","Fit over the bump and my butt!"
"vacation","I rented this as bikini cover-up on a boat tour.","It was perfect for that!","As some of the other reviews mentioned, in windy conditions this skirt can cause a major wardrobe malfunction.","But as a cover-up it worked great!"
"vacation","It is definitely form fitting.","It is true to size but a tight fit."
"vacation","Love all Equipment shirts/dresses.","Their silk is so light and luxurious.","This dress fit me perfectly and didnt show around the bust or arm holes.","The length was perfect on me but would probably be a bit short on someone who is taller or has longer legs.","Loved it for a hot Florida vacation."
"vacation","I had a hard time returning this one.","I wore it on 2 vacations, both beach, and didnt want to take it off.","Its so light and airy, and the high-low hemline makes it fun and makes an entrance everywhere.","Even as a cover up, it turns heads.","Away from the water, I wore a black bandeau underneath to avoid side boob peeks at the cut outs.","But with the bandeau, the cutouts look really cool and show a little skin at the sides of ribcage.","I love the button-up front too.","With something underneath, its cute to undo the top button to mix it up.","Definitely wish I could wear this around my land-locked house everyday!","Apologies for the dark lighting in the photo.","Doesnt do it justice."
"vacation","Comfortable fit, can be dressed up or down with heels/wedges or gold flip flops.","Great bright spring/summer color!"
"vacation","My husband who is an artist LOVED this dress, I dont typically purchase such bold designs (moreso classics) but this is exactly the benefit of renting!","The fit was not ideal, but it was good enough.","I would think this dress may fit best if you are petite or short-waisted and have either broad shoulders or chest because the dress is very short and I found it riding up, yet the open back means the top needs to be stretched to drape properly, so you may find yourself adjusting here and there.","I am short-waisted and broad shouldered, so it worked out okay for me, but I did size up to get as much fabric coverage as possible.","The whole thing is stretchy, so I could have worn the 10, or maybe even the 8, but I went with the 12 for this one due to the length.","Typically I wear a size 8 or a 10 if it runs small or has no hip room.","I had read this dress ran short, so I ordered the 10 & 12 anticipating Id want more fabric.","Basically I would not recommend if you are a long-bodied person or very tall because its just not long enough.","Sitting at dinner I felt I had to cover my lap with my napkin so no-one could tell there wasnt much dress still under me.","Overall, super cute, loved the pix, glad I rented it, but also glad I dont own it.","Get this one for mostly standing occasions!"
"vacation","This dress is super fun.","The ruffle makes it pretty distinctive.","The fabric was thick and forgiving while still being extra comfy.","I felt like the back bunched and had some extra fabric, you may want to size down if you like to show off your caboose."
"vacation","Perfect fit.","Looks just like the pic.twirly and fun.","Unfortunately the order came after I had already left town on vacation, so didnt get to wear the dress.","Would order again."
"vacation","Wore to a Luau in Hawaii.","After dinner I had to open the zipper on the side because I was STUFFED.","Lots of skirt fabric so it swishes when you walk.","Its too long for flats, so plan on wedges or heels.","Did not have an issue with the slit opening when I walked ever, wouldnt have even known it was there."
"vacation","I should have sized down.","It was too big.","Wearable, but too big."
"vacation","This is so cute and lightweight.","Youll want to wear it everyday!","It is a bit see-thru though so I wore it as a coverup over my swimsuit."
"vacation","It was light weight and didnt wrinkle badly during travel.","I was worried about the length being too short, but it was great with flat sandals for a casual look."
"vacation","I wore this dress to my friends bechelorette party in Las Vegas, and it was amazing!","I got told I looked like a disco ball, but it Vegas I took that as a good thing.","My only minor complaint is that it was so hot the sequins under the arms started to bother me a little toward the end of the night, but other than that...perfection!"
"vacation","The red of this dress is vibrantly beautiful.","If red is your color, this is definitely a dress to consider!","I am 53, 135 lbs.","and a consistent size 8.","I have a short waist and a broad back/shoulders.","This dress and this designer are best suited for for people with narrow frames.","I was able to pull off the L with some help getting the dress zipped, but I was pretty uncomfortable the whole night.","Because my waist is broad and short, the dress bunched up around the middle which made the length extra short.","When sitting down to dinner, I had to put 2 cloth napkins over my lap to ensure I was decently covered.","The fit in the shoulders was surprisingly roomy compared to the smallness of the waist.","I loved the color, but I likely will not order a dress by Parker again."
"vacation","Sort of fit me like a mumu (sp?","), but it was a fun option for casual dinner out on vacation!"
"vacation","Rented this to wear on the way to Mexico.","It was great, especially since it covered my legs and airports and airplanes can be cold.","Received many compliments.","You may have to iron it as it is a lot of fabric and arrives a bit wrinkled, but that was easily fixed.","Did not wear a bra, and instead used breast petals."
"vacation","Loved Loved Loved this dress!","If the hem was just a few inches shorter it would have looked perfect.","I am short so I need dresses to hit my knees not the middle of my calves."
"vacation","MY MOH wore this dress out in Vegas, shes on the left!","I rented it for her because of the discount when you rent two.","Despite being white on the bottom its still super flattering!","Shes 52, a size 6, 34D, and shes blessed with a booty.","Never would have picked this dress for her from seeing it on the hanger, and the pic doesnt do it justice (sorry I dont have any more) but this dress looked killer on her!","Made her look like a bombshell and she got tons of compliments.","She loved it and said shed rent it again for the next trip to Vegas :)"
"vacation","So Im not sure whether to rate this dress as true to size or small.","I say that because the dress fit perfectly everywhere except in the chest.","Right on the widest part it was tight which caused the sleeves to bunch up oddly as a result.","Its such a shame because this dress is beautiful and feels so luxurious!","I have a larger ribcage so I guess big-chested/busted wearers beware"
"vacation","Loved the colors of this dress, perfect for a sunset dinner at the beach.","The dress is very loose and flowy around the midsection and hips, but has a polished neckline.","I think wearing it with heels would have made me feel a bit more long and lean, but I wore with sandals.","Overall, its a stunning dress and I received several compliments."
"vacation","Very cute dress in soft water colors.","Fits very tight on the chest and its a lot shorter than I expected.","I wouldnt consider myself to have long legs but I felt like it was very short."
"vacation","The dress itself was amazing.","I loved it."
"vacation","Rented for a formal dinner during a girls weekend.","Cute dress.","Lace is unbelievable.","Really pretty neckline.","If you are hippy like me its not the most flattering cut because the waist is pretty high, but the dress is so pretty it doesnt even matter."
"vacation","Of all the pieces I have received in my unlimited orders this was by far one of my favorite pieces.","The jackets is high quality, very interesting and fit beautifully.","I wore it all day and wore it out at night.","It fit just like the picture with the model- loosely."
"vacation","1) If you have a bust, this top is not for you.","The cut just wasnt made for bustier ladies.","Its too short, too tight in the chest, very unflattering.","2) The ruffles on the sleeves are way too big.","On the RTR photos it looks interesting; in person it looks circus-y."
"vacation","Rented this dress for a day out during my bachelorette party.","It was super cute, but I was concerned with the practicality of wearing this romper because the zipper was tough getting up and down - and a little tight in the waste area - so I didnt wear.","It seemed a little short to me, too.","But not so short that I was uncomfortable wearing it (if I was taller than 56 I may be concerned).","Id recommend sizing up for ease of getting in and out of the romper!"
"vacation","Gorgeous.","Soft and comfortable, well-tailored.","Easy but still elegant.","Highly recommend."
"vacation","This dress was very flattering, yet forgiving.","It fit true to size, and I really loved it!"
"vacation","Part of Unlimited order.","Perfect fit, not too long, loads of compliments.","Super vivid colors.","You can wear a normal bra with it.","Plan to wear it more before I return it!"
"vacation","Loved this dress!","Although fitted, it was comfortable and easy to dance in.","I have a small bust, so Im often pulling up on strapless dresses; unfortunately, this was not an exception.","I would recommend it nonetheless!"
"vacation","I loved the top part of this dress.","It fit beautifully.","The fabric was also very rich.","I wish the bottom part of this dress hit higher around my waist because I felt like it hit me right where my stomach was, and it made me feel a little bigger than normal."
"vacation","I rented this dress for a romantic castle/dinner in Switzerland and it was perfect!","I was  looking for a piece that is high up on the list of current  fashion trends yet conservative as the Castle tour was a work related event for my husband.","While  I am fairly tall (57) and thin  I do have a large bust & the dress still fit perfectly!","Be prepared for a night of complements and questions because you will hear time and time again I love that dress where did you get it."
"vacation","I didnt end up wearing this on vacation, mainly because I thought I would be too hot.","The dress was longer than I would have liked and hit right above my knee.","I would have also needed to use some fashion tape since the top was gaping.","A size smaller might have done the trick."
"vacation","Perfect dress for a weekend or vacation.","I ended up belting it with a brown belt as the dress did flare out towards the bottom.","I would definitely wear this again."
"vacation","I dont have a photo of this but will try to get.","It is super low like everyone else said but super sexy for a night out with the husband.","Loved the details but the straps did fall down all night so wish they were more fitted.","Loved this one too."
"vacation","Super cute detailing and styling.","Deep navy blue, unique sleeves / strap concept.","Loved."
"vacation","Beautiful print, great fit, loved the small pockets.","Unfortunately, the belt was missing."
"vacation","Loved the top, but you have to watch that it doesnt open if you your trying to avoid baring your midriff :)"
"vacation","I loved the details on the long sleeves of this awesome dress.","It was perfect for a winter European vacation and went well with boots and tights.","Great shift and fit my super wide athletic shoulders with ease."
"vacation","Fit perfectly.","Shoulders, arms, waist length.","If I lived in cooler weather climate, I would own this wonderful warm coat."
"vacation","It was a little shorter and tighter than the Slate and Willow silver/champagne one Id rented before.","Different fabric!","That one was looser, while this one didnt have much give.","Would have rented in a larger size if theyd had it available!"
"vacation","Loved the colors of this dress, was perfect for a sunset cruise in Aruba during my honeymoon.","I wish i had ordered the size 4, the 6 was very large and boxy, no shape at all.","I had to pin the sides.","I did receive a lot of compliments on the colors.","very lightweight."
"vacation","Fit well - small fit my body perfectly."
"vacation","This dress is a stunner!","Amazing print, super comfy fabric and love the adjustable straps and tie in the front.","Being so tall Im always conscious about maxis not being long enough.","Not a problem once I made the straps a little longer.","Im not kidding when I say I have NEVER gotten that many compliments from complete strangers wearing this dress!","I wore it on a Sunday out on vacation shopping and such and it was a huge hit.","So much so that I am going to re-order and purchase!"
"vacation","Stiff fabric.","Lots of compliments.","So cute.","Love this one!","!"
"vacation","would be great for hiding a baby bump, or a food baby"
"vacation","sexy without being sleazy- the fabric is thick so it hides flaws easily.","Wore with wedges to brunch and to after work drinks.","The perfect LBJ"
"vacation","The fit was a little big on be but based on the style of the dress it still worked really well!","lots of texture to the dress which made it unique!","Open back made it very breathable and comfortable in the warm weather :)"
"vacation","Wore this for my friends bachelorette, overall fit well but a little loose in the bust (I have a small bust line).","There is an opening in the top layer under the left arm to allow access to the zipper that I safety pinned to make it sit more comfortably."
"vacation","I absolutely adore this piece.","It fits perfectly, in all the right places.","Its comfortable.","Extremely flattering, especially on taller woman.","I got a ton of compliments and I felt like a million bucks.","The deep berry color is beautiful, especially with a tan.","I wore this in Vegas but it can really be worn anywhere, especially a date night.","Your significant other will be drooling."
"vacation","Cute with a jean jacket and scarf!"
"vacation","I felt like I was wearing body armor.","The dress was so heavy it instantly made me hulk up.","Overall, just okay.","Definitely ran a little large."
"vacation","Paired with jeans, comfortable, hides problem areas and can eat a large meal without showing.","Low cut so had to wear a cami."
"vacation","The dress does run large in the waist as others have said.","I grabbed a skinny belt before we left and used that to cinch the waistline so it was a bit more flattering.","You couldnt even see the belt because the top blouses over, so it worked perfectly.","Its a very pretty dress and I felt sparkly!"
"vacation","I would have loved to wear this for vacation but when I tried it on it was a little too short and the hips kept riding up on me making it even shorter.","I may have needed one size larger.","Maybe a small would fit better.","I have an athletic build like a gymnast."
"vacation","If youre not  in love with your arms or the armpit area, you might want to reconsider this dress, but otherwise it was sooooo comfortable and faltering!"
"vacation","Fit well.","Comfortable and hung nicely.","A bit too much like a costume but color was nice and off shoulder trend worked."
"vacation","So cute!","Unfortunately it didnt quite fit in the back-- a bit too snug to zip up and button around the neck"
"vacation","I wear a 0-2 dress and this fits perfectly everywhere EXCEPT the bust.","Bustier gals - go a size up!"
"vacation","Rented for a vacation but ran really big and was not flattering.","Didnt wear it."
"vacation","The dress is beautiful and fits true to size.","There are slits on both sides that are not too extreme and stay mostly closed while walking.","There is a black sheath that comes separately and hits mid thigh.","The lower part of the dress is fairly see through in the sunlight.","I wore a light sweater since I am old and do not like my arms to show.","It would look better without the sweater, but it was a delight to wear and I will rent it again."
"vacation","This dress fit snug through the hips but was large in the chest area.","It was fairly short on me and I am only 50.","Overall, great vacation dress."
"vacation","I loved this dress!","One of my favorite rentals so far.","The bell sleeves are super cute and the drawstring waist helped flatter my figure.","Only negatives to this dress were the sleeves were a bit tight on my upper arms (I also need to hit the gym so maybe thats just me!)","and print is unique to each dress, and thankfully I liked the way the print was on the size that fit me best.","Wish I could buy this!","!"
"vacation","This was quite loose around my mid section, and also quite short.","I found it perfect for brunch on vacation.","The fabric and details are great, and you can tell its a high end piece."
"vacation","So cute.","I through a top on it as well and it worked awesomely.","Very comfortable, very breathable."
"vacation","Very cute dress, but definitely runs big, I would recommend sizing down."
"vacation","No stretch, fits true to size."
"vacation","I love the color and the fit of this romper!","It is so flattering!"
"vacation","Its a little tight so I need to go up one size.","Runs small but super flattering!"
"vacation","Just a little tight on the arms but overall a great fit and not too tight around your middle so you dont have to suck in constantly."
"vacation","This was a truly amazing dress.","Perfect fit and length for a night out in Vegas!"
"vacation","I was surprised by how much I loved this dress.","I was afraid that the print would be too much, but it was perfect for dinner out at a resort in Mexico.","The fit flatters all of the right places and was very comfortable.","There is a tie back, which adds a little sexiness to the look.","And best of all--the length!","It didnt drag like many maxi dresses can on us shorter folks."
"vacation","I liked the look of the sleeves on this but I was mostly wearing a coat over it so you couldnt see the sleeves.","Its better for warm weather when you wouldnt need a coat.","Also, when I posed for pics the gaps between the buttons open up when you turn to the side at all so be careful of this :)."
"vacation","Great for the cocktail hour destination wedding in Cancun"
"vacation","I loved this dress and got sooooo many compliments!","I brought it to Mexico and it was perfect to wear at night when it was in the low 70s.","The top is very sheer, but I was able to get away with a nude bra (a black cami didnt work with the low V cut).","Would love to buy this dress if possible."
"vacation","This dress is SUPER cute and very lightweight.","I am usually between a 4-6 and I rented the 6 and felt like it was easy to move around in.","The elastic waist band I think would make it that if you are in between sizes you could go either way.","I do agree with other reviewers that they shoulders come up quite a bit.","Overall love this dress - I rented it with my Unlimited and have already worn it twice."
"vacation","It wasnt until I shared this photo on social media of my cat photobombing me, that I noticed the design of the cats face on the torso of the dress.","This dress has a distinctive, deep cut of the armholes that accentuates the arms and shoulders.","Theres nothing wrong with the dress; the armholes arent too big, as other reviewers have noted.","It just might not be to everyones taste.","Wearing a bra that peeks out isnt bad; wearers should choose a lacy bra thats meant to be seen.","The rayon fabric is cool and perfect for late summer, up into early fall with a sweater.","I loved the dress and wore it twice.","However, I saw at least a dozen of them on the clearance rack at a department store, while shopping with friends, which immediately cut the wow factor for me.","Its Rent the Runway, not Rent the Clearance Rack."
"vacation","This dress fits great!","The straps in the back make it super adjustable.","It is a bit bulky to pack for vacation, but even jammed in my suitcase it came out looking close to perfect!","It was a really versatile dress - could be dressed up with heels or worn casually with a jean jacket.","Any way you wear this dress, it is simultaneously fun and elegant - would rent again!"
"vacation","The material of this dress was much thicker than I thought it would be.","The bottom does flare out a bit.","The top fit very well.","This ran true to size for me.","It was also very comfortable as the material had some stretch."
"vacation","The dress is stunning!","The cut outs and print make the dress feel perfect for summer.","However, you need to have a long torso to wear this dress (I dont think height matters).","Because of where the waist hits, it made me look like I was pregnant.","Because of how the top lays, I looked flat chested.","If you are curvy like me, this probably isnt the dress for you."
"vacation","I am nearly 57 and couldnt wear this dress because I was stepping all over it.","I love Parkers dresses and this one is fabulous, but there needs to be a shorter option."
"vacation","Ability to unstap at the bust to make it a deeper plunge for going out, or button up when sitting down for dinner.","I paired this with a jean jacket and wedges - it was so comfortable and flattering.","Didnt need a bra which I loved!"
"vacation","Loved loved this dress and so bummed I didnt take a photo in it.","I had to wear a stick on bra, due to the back being all lace.","Wore it with black shoes as there is some black threading in the lace."
"vacation","I really loved this dress.","It is simple with a fun print and a flattering cut.","I read that this dress runs a bit big so I ordered the medium long and it fit perfectly.","I was able to wear a small wedge heel and the dress hit the floor perfectly.","Luckily I wore this on vacation to Mexico in February so I can definitely rent this again in the summer!"
"vacation","I wore this romper for a wine tour the day after my wedding and received almost as many compliments as I did on my wedding dress!","This romper is cute and comfortable, but beware it is on the short side!","I was comfortable in the environment I was in but was slightly nervous to lean over at all!","I paired it with a black leather jacket in the shade and it created two totally different looks.","I would love to own this romper!"
"vacation","This dress is a gorgeous pop of color and super comfortable.","I brought it to Cancun, and it was perfect bc it didnt wrinkle and was a great dress to be casual or dress up.","There was a pretty thick slip underneath and the material is a bit thicker, not sheen...so I wouldnt wear it in balmy weather, but I will definitely rent this again.","Its a fun, comfortable dress!"
"vacation","I received so many compliments on this dress.","I wore this for formal night on a cruise.","The back of the dress flows nicely when walking and floats beautifully"
"vacation","I ended up not wearing this one.","It was fine, but not a favorite.","The detailing in the openness of the back was cool, but the front was very shapeless and quite high necked.","A bit more on the conservative side if that is something youre after."
"vacation","It was a lovely material, super comfy.","However, it did fit very large on me... extremely.","The color is beautiful (perfect for fourth of july) and the material was nice and breathable so it wasnt hot at all.","I thought it would have been perfect if not so large and also the strings used to tie the dress around the neck just arent very functional."
"vacation","I absolutely loved this dress.","It was so flattering on, and I received so many compliments.","I am already hoping I have a reason to rent it again."
"vacation","I love everything about this dress.","Ive rented it multiple times and am always sad when I have to send it back.","Its light, flowy, well made and has unique details that make it a standout.","The beading around the neck takes it to another level.","The see-through panels on the bottom give it a hint a skin to make it not your normal maxi.","Its also versatile.","You could dress it up or wear it for every day.","Ill definitely be renting (and maybe buying) this fabulous dress!"
"wedding","Fit well and looked pretty, but I could not like my arms up all the way (to dance)."
"wedding","I loved the color!","I got a bunch of compliments & felt comfortable all night until I ate too much food which of course was not the dresss fault.",":) I usually wear an 8 which was much too big on me.","The straps on the 6 were still a little big, but manageable.","Overall, loved it & would rent it again!"
"wedding","This dress was comfortable and fit great.","I normally have a straight figure, but this dress gave me some shape.","The extra material on the hips and on the back gave me that hourglass look.","I was really excited to wear it and I loved the slit and neckline."
"wedding","I loved the bright color of this dress and got lots of compliments!","I wore it to a summer wedding on a very hot night, but the material is very light, despite the two layers, so it was perfect!","It fits true to size, I wore the 14.","The torso was a little long, but that is common for me.","I am 53 and the length was perfect for me - I like a dress to hit at the top of my knee.","I wore it with a pair of lower, camel wedges as it wasnt a formal wedding and the ceremony was outside.","I felt like I could have dressed it up or down easily.","It does require a strapless bra because the material at the top is sheer.","Overall a great dress!"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a Wedding and at first I couldnt decide if I liked it or not, but once you get the right accessories this dress is beautiful.","I got so many compliments, everyone loved it.","It runs very true to size and it has nice coverage if you have a full bust, but still a little cleavage.","A respectable amount of cleavage.","I recommend some butt lifting spans as the back kind of does nothing for ya in that department.","When I first put it on I thought the sequins in the armpit would bug, but they didnt at all.","And, boy does it sparkle in the sun!","!"
"wedding","The 2L is a bit snug, but I prefer a tighter fit, because hello curves!","The 4 was to larger on me, albeit I did need some assistance zipping it up at the bust.","The color is cobalt, NOT navy in the sample photo.","The slits didnt bother me at all, I wore 2 inch heels and the dress skimmed the floor.","I adored this dress, I felt like a million dollars, and based upon the reviews in general you will too.","If my male counterparts could tell you what they thought of me in this dress, it wouldnt entirely be appropriate.","haha.","Cheers ladies!"
"wedding","I loved the dress.","The sleeves were a little long on the Small and thats why I chose to wear the XS.","I paired the dress with the cobalt shoes even though I wasnt sure if it was to much for the wedding.","I do wish there was a liner in the dress even though it already was made from thick scuba like material.","I had to wear a seamless thong and a bodycon slip over them so you couldnt see the outline.","All together I loved the dress and received a million complements."
"wedding","I would have loved to wear this dress because the color is amazing, and the ribbon detail on the back is so cute.","However, the bust was wayyy to small for me.","It was more a combination of the area, arms, bust, and shoulders, so I did not get to wear this dress out."
"wedding","I normally wear a size 12 but saw the dress and loved the unique design.","I order a 14 which I thought might be too big but it fit perfect because of the extra room in the bust area which I needed.","I received so many complements throughout the night.","The fabric is a little heavy so it might now be the best choice for an event in a warmer climate but it made it work."
"wedding","The dress pulls in just below the waist (Im 56 with a loser torso), which made the top a little sac like and matronly.","Beautiful dress, just wasnt the right fit for me."
"wedding","This dress was perfect for a winter wedding.","I felt so elegant and beautiful!","This dress is also very comfortable.","I was nervous that the dress would be too tight in the bust, but it was perfect."
"wedding","The fit was true to size.","I rented a 10 and a 12--ended up wearing the 10 because the 12 was a little too baggy in the waist.","It was very comfortable to wear.","(A little on the short side for me.","Not what I am used to.)","the color was awesome and I kept getting compliments all night.","The back of the dress isnt nearly as low as it looks on the model.","Great rental --would recommend!"
"wedding","Very comfortable but sheerer than I had thought it would be.","Wore it twice :)"
"wedding","I ordered this dress in a 0 and 2 for a wedding.","The 0 fit well but was really short, so I went with the 2 and it was perfect.","The color was amazing, but the material was a bit think so wearing this outdoors in the summer may not be the way to go...but if there is AC there will be no issue.","Loved it!","Ton of compliments"
"wedding","Figured Id toss this review up even though I went with another option.","Im 53, about 133 lbs, hourglass shape.","This 6P was the perfect length with ~3.5 heels.","The color is really nice, the neckline is actually quite flattering (and the arm holes dont cause any bulging) but I was not a huge fan of the cutouts - they are thinner lengthwise than in the photo and the fabric bunches around them, perhaps it just didnt sit as well on my figure.","Still a really nice dress, and very comfortable."
"wedding","It was long even with 3-4 in heels, I am 54 3/4.","Didnt need a bra."
"wedding","Very comfortable, has some weight to it, but moves nicely.","Would not recommend for hot temperatures.","Wore it to a wedding in Chicago and a majority of the guests used RTR because of the storefront in the city."
"wedding","This dress is a great color and really comfortable.","I felt like it was missing something, though, to give it an it factor."
"wedding","Definitely order up in size.","The dress itself was gorgeous; however, you could tell this one had been worn quite a few times before.","The lace sheath had obviously been rubbed to where you could see light stringy fuzz.","Luckily I wasnt at an event or in front of a crowd or I may have been a little self conscious...","But thats the great part of getting married at city hall!","This particular dress will probably need to be retire d soon, but Overall I thought it was still beautiful."
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress.","When I saw it on the hanger, I wasnt 100% sure, but when I put it on, it was perfect.","Very unique and classy.","I wore this to a NYE formal wedding and got a ton of compliments.","I had rented a couple other more fitted dresses, but ultimately went with this one becuse it was light, comfortable and just different.","Also, I am 15 weeks pregnant and it was very comfortable in the belly area.","The dress is a 2L and that is my usual dress size.","If I was not pregnant, I could have work a 0L.","I am 58 and currently 118 lbs.","I wore 3.5 inch heels with the dress for shoe reference.","The dress was also brand new with the tags which was really nice :)"
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress!","It was the perfect length on me, and I felt super comfortable in it.","I got compliments all night and it was easy and comfortable for dancing.","I chose to wear my hair up because wearing it down would have distracted from the back!"
"wedding","Great, versatile, easy to wear dress even with the cut outs.","It was very long so I had to hem with tape.","Otherwise it was a fun dress I wouldnt normally buy so renting it was perfect."
"wedding","Loved this dress but, unfortunately, I didnt wear it.","I ordered it as a backup just in case and decided on my first choice.","This dress was a bit short for me.","Im 55 and weigh 118.","I ordered the size 2, which fit perfectly, but the hemline hit right about 2.5 above the knee and at my age, which is 62, I just felt it was not age-appropriate.","Plus, the skirt was a bit too poofy for me, which made it seem even shorter.","But the quality and style of this dress is great."
"wedding","  I was worried about it being too short, but it came much closer to my knees (Im 54), which I was happy about.","I thought it was true to size for a designer brand, but for reference I usually wear a 0 in brands like J.","Crew or banana."
"wedding","I normally wear a size 4 or even a 6 sometimes in dresses...","I wore the size 2.","It was a better fit in my boobs but it was hard to zip up around my rib cage.","The size 4 just didnt fit my body that well.","So I would totally recommend getting a size smaller.","Also I am 5,7 and I wore pretty tall high heels and I personally still think it was too long.","Im not use to wearing gowns so Im not sure if they should touch the floor but my dress, even in my high heels, needed to be held up when I walked."
"wedding","The fit was fitted up top and loose along the bottom, nice flow, great when dancing.","Sexy without being over the top."
"wedding","First Rent the Runway experience.","I was hesitant about the dress at first, but followed through with ordering it and was so happy that I did.","The dress is much more better looking in person than in the picture!","I liked wearing the strap together, I dont love the look of it separated over the shoulder.","It was a little long in the back even with pretty high heels, I stepped on it a few times.","All in all, it was a fun dress, I received compliments on how great it looked, and was sad to return it."
"wedding","Fit was great.","I would say it runs pretty true to size.","I am in between a 0 and 2 because I am curvy through the hips and thighs, but the 0 was fine!","The back is amazing and very sexy.","My only issue with it is that it tended to gap a little right behind my armpits on the back if I wasnt standing with perfect posture.","Other than that, I loved it!","Lots of compliments!"
"wedding","I got a 12L and a 10L to try, the 10L fit best.","I am 57 and wore a 2.5 heel which met the dress perfectly.","Some of the sequins at the bottom of the dress looked worn/missing but they didnt impact the beauty of the dress negatively at all.","I had strangers and waitstaff approach me all night telling me how gorgeous this dress was.","Definitely worth the rental!","First time rental for me Im totally sold and telling all my friends."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a farm chic wedding and wanted comfort and color- which the dress delivered on.","The dress is amazing and I received so many compliments.","Like the other reviewers said, I did not want to give it back!!","Thank you RTR for a great experience."
"wedding","The adjustable straps were what sold me on the dress and were what made the dress perfect.","Im rather small chested and so tightening the straps to the max enabled me to go braless.","The material makes for a very comfortable fit however created a few problems.","It is rather long so I sported 5 inch heels that often got caught in the extra (very sheer) fabric at the bottom and almost caused few face plants.","It was incredibly comfortable and I would recommend it to a small chested, taller friend!"
"wedding","Loved this dress for a rehearsal dinner.","Great fit, very flattering and comfortable for the whole night"
"wedding","I felt amazing and comfortable in this dress.","I havent felt great about my body since having my baby and the flowy waistline of this dress was super forgiving.","I got so many compliments.","I dont think Im super tall, but if I had planned on wearing really high heels I would have wanted the dress to be longer.","I wore 2.5 inch heels and it felt like the right length if not a little too short."
"wedding","Little snug in the shoulders.","Wore to a September wedding and recieved plently of compliements.","Would totally wear again!"
"wedding","Fit was true to size and quite comfortable.","I wore pretty high heels, which is a definite must for us shorties!","The length was perfect with my heels, though.",":)"
"wedding","Loved this dress SO much.","While Ive loved a majority of the other dresses Ive rented, this one I didnt want to send back.","Back detail is so unique, fit was perfect, hem detail/length was awesome.","I felt like a million bucks."
"wedding","Runs true to size, however the dress is made to be tight and curve revealing, so if youre overweight like me, I recommend going a size or two above just so its a bit looser, you can feel more comfortable and its more flattering too.","The 12 did fit me, but I felt that the 14 looked better.","I am wearing spanx also.","As for height, the petite went up to my shins, so i liked the regular better because they covered my feet, but just enough that I wasnt stepping on it.","I was wearing 4 inch heels.","The backdrop is gorgeous, but it does show the bra, so i secured it with my bra and it still looked great!","Overall experience: Amazing dress!!","get it!","!"
"wedding","I took a chance on this one after seeing such great photos from the other girls who have rented this dress and all I can say is that I hope my experience also inspires someone else to rent this dress, too.","This dress was the perfect dress for an early April wedding in Chicago where youre ready for spring, but you know there is going to be a definite chill in the air.","The color and the lace fabric was exactly what I was looking for.","There is a bit of a stretch to the material so it definitely makes for a comfy frock.","Since I was running late to get dressed, I just threw on the size 10, even though I typically where a size 8.","But since the cut of this dress is a bit low in the front and I felt a little more exposed than normal, I think wearing the 10 was perfect for my comfort as well as my girls :)"
"wedding","I was the wedding officiants date so I didnt want to look too too sexy, but I still wanted to look good, you know?","This dress was perfect.","Looks a little different in different types of light, which made for fun pictures.","It had pockets, which could fit an iphone 7 plus without falling out.","(My sunglasses however, did not survive, but that might be the open bars fault and not the pockets.)","4 was my backup size, so Im super glad they offered one."
"wedding","Everything was great - the pattern, the fabric, and the fit!","Such a great rental for a wedding or any nice event.","Definitely recommend."
"wedding","The color and material are gorgeous and I love the hemline, but the neckline was SO LOW it was absolutely unwearable.","An inch or even half and inch higher cut would have made a world of difference.","I bought a specialy deep plunge bra to wear with the dress and it was visible.","The material is way to loose to wear without a bra.","The 2R fit as well but unfortunately the neckline was just as bad."
"wedding","Fit true to size"
"wedding","The fit was true to size.","A bit snug in the hip area but I have very big hips.","The 8 was too big in the bust and hip area for my taste.","It hugged me curves in all the right places and made me feel like I was celebrity on the red carpet!","I got so many compliments on how gorgeous the dress was and how well it went with my skin tone.","The only annoying part was the sequins ended up giving me tiny rashes on the undersides of my arms from rubbing against the skin all night.","Besides that, I would definitely recommend this dress!"
"wedding","Very, very flattering"
"wedding","I ordered the size 6 as well as the 8 - I ended up wearing the 8.","It was a little tight in the shoulders and hips (I have a curvy, athletic build).","Definitely true to size, though.","Id say the only con is that if you arent flat-chested, you have to wear a stick-on bra or something of that sort because of the open lace back.","Otherwise, I received a lot of compliments!"
"wedding","Amazing!","Got so many  compliments."
"wedding","I loved this dress!","It was super comfortable and easy to wear.","I went with the XS because it does run a bit big in the top.","Im not very busty so I liked the tight fit of the XS better than the Small.","I was very happy with this dress!"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a Friday night wedding and it was very appropriate for the occasion.","The dress is definitely more purple than it appears in the picture, but its still a deep, pretty color.","I usually wear a size 4 or 6 in dresses, and wound up wearing this dress in the 6 because theres absolutely no stretch to the material.","I couldnt have lifted my arms at all if I had worn the 4.","That being said, its still very comfortable as long as youre okay with the lace overlay not being the most flexible material."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a 2pm high tea wedding in Southern California.","It was 90+ degrees at the start so I knew I had made the right choice.","I ordered the 12 and 14, and if I order it again I would probably get the 10 and 12, the 12 was just a tad too big.","However, it worked out great for me for the outdoor wedding, as I didnt feel like I was packed into my dress and I was SO comfortable!"
"wedding","Overall I really liked the dress.","The material was a bit heavy for the month I wore it; its definitely more of a winter wedding dress.","I also didnt realize how much the bottom portion of the dress would flare out.","Got tons of compliments and was glad I tried something different."
"wedding","The dress was great!","The colors work well together.","I was worried that my bra would show on the side, but it didnt, which I was thankful for.","The only negative that I can possibly think of is that the pockets arent really that deep.","It was perfect for my chap stick, but I wouldnt trust my phone to stay in there while dancing.","However, having my phone in my pocket isnt that important if a feature to me, so this dress is still fabulous!","I love the material and was perfectly happy with it.","The dress was great and made me feel good in it."
"wedding","Beautiful true red color.","Wrinkles fall out quickly when you remove it from bag."
"wedding","I was overall pretty happy with this dress -- the color is great and its an extremely light dress.","Great for a warm spring wedding.","My only complaints are about the fit.","I sized up two full sizes, as Im 8.5 months pregnant, and the dress fill fit extremely tightly around my rib cage.","At the same time, the chest area was fairly large, and Im currently a DD!","The dress blouses in the back as well, so its not exactly a sleek look.","I still got lots of complements, but the funniness on the sizing would make me think twice before ordering this style again.","The dress was plenty long.","I wore flats, and it still went right to the floor (Im 511)."
"wedding","Didnt need to wear a bra, skirt wasnt too long and Im only 411.","I wish I could have kept it!"
"wedding","I wore this dress when I was 22 weeks pregnant (with second baby, so showing more like third trimester with a first baby).","It was PERFECT.","It has a slightly higher waist so that it was fitted above the bump, and the pleats are incredibly forgiving and flattering over the bump.","I received an insane number of compliments, was told I was the best dressed person there, and I felt like a million bucks.","Could not recommend more for a pregnant woman."
"wedding","Loved this dress for an August wedding!","I received endless compliments all night and didnt want to take it off.","The detail is beautiful and it was incredibly flattering.","I wore it with a strapless bra.","The material was slightly itchy but after the beer in the picture, it didnt bother me :) I would rent this again in a heartbeat."
"wedding","The dress is very flattering.","I rented the 6 & 8, wore the 8 because it was a bit looser and more comfortable.","I didnt want to have to wear Spanx.","As mentioned, the fabric does not stretch and it is heavier.","This was a warm outdoor wedding, but I felt comfortable all night.","I would call the color a seafoam green, more than a blue.","I had a pair of heels picked out, but a pair of flats I own were a perfect match.","The Nine West Slancha Flat in green leather.",":)"
"wedding","This dress was beautiful!","I have never worn a dress like this so I am glad I received a back up size.","I am average height and the dress did drag on the floor some but it was just the right length.","I wore about 3 inch heels so if they were taller I would imagine it would not have dragged at all.","The only con is that the sequins on the top part of the dress rubbed against my inner arm so by the end of the night my inner bicep was scratched up...but it was worth it!"
"wedding"," Fit well, easy to dance and eat in."
"wedding","I wore this dress for my surprise NYE wedding and it was perfect, and so glamorous.","I ordered a size 8R and a 6R as backup and wore the 6R, it fit like a glove.","I am very self-conscious about my midsection, and this dress (with the help of some control top panties!)","was very forgiving!","I would recommend a backless bra, the type with adhesive sides as it is too low in the back for a regular bra.","I wore a backless bra from Soma and it felt like it was built right into the dress, I put it on and forgot all about it!","I am 54 and wore 2.5-3 heels and the length was just right for it to not drag on the ground.","The worst part of this dress was sending it back!"
"wedding","Runs VERY Large.","I am normally a size 6, and ended up wearing a 2.","Probably could have worn a 0 since the top was loose.","Otherwise a great dress though!","Loved wearing it."
"wedding","This dress hugged my body in the right places.","Very flattering.","The only complaint I have is that I constantly had to straighten the dress because when I would walk the dress would shift to the right."
"wedding","This dress was stunning in person.","My only qualm with it was that the sizing appeared to be a bit strange.","The 4 fit my torso and hips perfectly but the chest was a little tight and the arms were a bit snug.","I was reading at the wedding I rented this dress for so I wanted to be comfortable and thus, wore the 6.","That dress fit my bust and arms but the tummy was gigantic!","As you can see in the picture, the dress folded onto itself all night.","This was fine though, because it meant I could dance the night away in comfort!"
"wedding","I am 510 and the Small fit perfectly.","It wasnt too short and it was great for dancing.","I got so many compliments on it, and everyone loved the open back.","This is the 2nd time Ive rented this romper.","I love it!"
"wedding","Run between a 10-12.","Need a bit more room in the bust...fits elsewhere."
"wedding","Fit great, was definitely form fitting, but was comfortable and looked great."
"wedding","The dress was beautiful, though it is almost impossible to wear with any kind of bra (I ended up pulling my strapless bra way down my back and pinning it!)","Lace detailing was really nice and not itchy at all; gorgeous color.","I always love MLs silhouettes and this dress did not disappoint."
"wedding","Easy fit.","I was comfortable the entire day & night.","This is a dress that may require a body shaper but it is well worth it!"
"wedding","It is a cute dress and the body fit perfect but too tight on my breast and could not wear it.","No stretch at all across the breast but a little stretch around the waist"
"wedding","As others said, it ran large.","The 0 had plenty of room (Im normally a 4, have a 27 waist).","I opted to wear another dress to a wedding since this one didnt have a wow factor that another did, but for a basic elegant dress, I would recommend this one."
"wedding","Unique!"
"wedding","Very flattering, fit true to size.","Only negative is even petite sizes are a bit long  for someone who is 5’3”"
"wedding","The dress was comfortable and good to dance in.","The top of the dress was extremely loose.","I took the recommendation of safety pinning it.","It was very pretty"
"wedding","I ended up wearing something else.","I would have chosen to wear this dress but it was a bit too short even though I ordered a Long.","I am 57 and with 5 inch heels it looked a bit short.","It has a beautiful fit and if it was an inch longer it would have been the option I chose to wear."
"wedding","I will start with the cons - the zipper!","I actually thought I wouldnt be able to wear the dress because the zipper gets stuff at the waist.","My husband and I finally discovered that I laid down, we were able to get the zipper up but ALOT of effort went into it.","There is some itchiness/scraping going on underneath the arm because of the sequins but nothing that you wont forget about once you are having fun.","I wouldve ordered the dress in a short but the regular was all that was available.","Im 52 and with a decent sized heel, the dress still touched the ground and I felt like I had to hold it up while I was walking just to be on the safe side.","Overall it is a very pretty dress and I feel like it covers up the right parts.","(on a sidenote, I also ordered the 8R which fit but had the same issue with the zipper.","I decided to stick with the 10 because there was a dramatic difference in the chest area one size down.","Way more of my chest showed in the 8 than in the 10 so I stuck with the 10)"
"wedding","Loved this dress and received several compliments, even from strangers on the street!","I felt very classy but fun with the cut outs.","The color is gorgeous and the material felt heavy and well made.","As many of the reviews have said, size up.","I normally wear a size 0, but the 2 fit me perfectly.","However, I am 5ft 7” and wore nice flat sandals so that I could feel comfortable dancing as it ran a little short on me.","I  am bustier but got away with just wearing pasties and didnt have any issues.","This dress was perfect for a wedding and would no doubt wear again!"
"wedding","Rented this dress for an October Wedding.","Im glad I read the reviews -- because the size 2 fit perfectly, when I am usually a 4/6.","With this dress, go with your waist and bust measurement when selecting a size.","I am 57, pear shaped, and the size 2 fit almost perfectly, falling to just about the same point right at the knee as it did on the model.","I was a little disappointed when I first opened the box and saw that the dress was much more purple than it appeared to be on my computer screen, I also felt that the addition of the belt was necessary for me as I am long waisted and the waist on the 2 was just a touch too high.","Overall a great dress -- I had several people tell me that I should buy it!"
"wedding","I typically wear a size 4-6 in pants, but always have to wear a size 8 or even 10 in dresses.","I wore a size 44 in this.","The 46 was WAY too big.","That being said, the dress material is VERY stretchy.","So much so that there isnt even a zipper!","I would recommend not doing an updo with your hair, or simply stepping into the dress.","It was extremely comfortable.","I paired it with black peep toe shoes and a gold clutch.","I received a lot of compliments.","Im only 54 so this did hit below my knees.","Im also wider than the model, I have broad shoulders, and Im very athletic, and I absolutely loved this dress and thought it looked great!","I wore this to a co-workers wedding with nine other male co-workers and none of us were allowed +1s.","It was definitely classy and appropriate."
"wedding","I ordered both the small and the medium.","I found the small to be very tight on the waist, but perfect on the chest (for my small chest).","However, the medium was a much more comfortable fit on the waist.","The chest was bigger, but fit just fine with a padded bra.","Overall, a great dress.","Unique, well made and fun colors."
"wedding","This is a flatteringly beautiful dress that fits TTS.","The tulip petals pattern camouflaged my belly pooch and was comfortable throughout the night."
"wedding","Ive realized a trend in my RTR orders, Badgley Mischka every time.","And Im never disappointed.","This dress was stunning.","Im 54.","I ordered a 4R and 6R and went with the 6 because the neckline was a little too tight on the 4.","Lengthwise, the 6 was only maybe half an inch or an inch longer, and grazed the floor perfectly with 4 inch heels.","The skirt flowed as I walked and turned, and even though I didnt exactly master going up stairs by the end of the night, I dont think too many people noticed.","The fit was VERY comfortable.","I wore a strapless bra and regular panties, no need for Spanx.","Sitting, eating, and dancing were all easy.","I just felt so pretty in this dress.","And complete strangers were coming up to me all night with compliments and saying theyve been watching the dress from across the room."
"wedding","Amazing dress, something different but still appropriate for formal events.","Personally since I have a narrow chest measurements but full bust the top showed a little more side boob than I wouldve liked.","But that can be fixed with fashion tape."
"wedding","This was my  2nd choice since the 1st I picked was unavailable.","I LOVED IT!","Felt like a princess all night and received many compliments.","The back design makes the dress so unique.","Its safe enough not to wear a bra.","The dress slightly touched the ground with my 2 and a half in heels.","Def recommend!"
"wedding","The color is beautiful and it was comfortable to sit in as well as dance in.","My only negative comment is that the dress was a little bit tight around my bust, but thats a common issue for me so I wasnt surprised.","I couldnt wear a bra, but luckily didnt need one because of the thickness of the fabric.","Would definitely rent this again"
"wedding","I was notified the day before that the dress in my alternative size, was not arriving.","I was worried but ended up contacting an agent, and they located me one right away.","Thought i didnt need my back up size, I still felt the customer service was top notch.","I loved this dress and ended up wearing it with nude shoes, not the blue ones.","It was perfect for the wedding and I ended up wearing a short jacket over it since it was cold.","I didnt want to return it I loved it so much and would rent it again!","Even the back was stunning!","I got lots of compliments and it was great to be in a nice color for a spring/summer wedding.","The color is the perfect shade of cobalt blue"
"wedding","Was the perfect length with about 3.5 to 4 inch heels.","Fit me like a glove."
"wedding","I got this dress to wear to a wedding and loved it!","I was a little nervous to get it because there isnt a picture of a model wearing it or any previous renters but it worked out!","I got a medium and a large and ending up wearing the medium.","Im typically between a medium and a large, Im 57 and 150 pounds.","Im a 34DD and the dress was snug enough that I didnt even wear a bra but a strapless bra would definitely work for the dress.","The color looks a lot darker in my picture, but its very true to the stock picture in person.","Overall I would recommend this dress and think it would be great on any body type!"
"wedding","runs a little big.","I typically wear a l or xl I ended up going with the l the xl was way too big."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a black tie wedding.","I received so many compliments and the dress fit me perfectly.","I had originally ordered the 6L as my priority size, but decided to go with 8L for a little more comfort and eating space.","I received so many compliments throughout the night and loved the way I looked in it.","Thank you RTR!"
"wedding","This dress was amazing and the lace sleeves make the dress so classy.","I wore this to a fall wedding and got so many compliments on it.","I typically wear a size 8 but went up a size as I knew I needed a size 10 from this designer.","The dress was not skin tight on me, which made it more comfortable to dance and move around in."
"wedding","The dress is absolutely gorgeous and unique.","But other reviewers were not lying when they said it is SHORT.","Im 52 and it was a very short dress on me, so I would think it could be very very short on a taller woman.","The dress is a tight dress, but I wouldnt say that it runs small.","Even in the smaller size, I was comfortable.","Definitely did not feel like I had to hold my breath all night.","The fabric is structured and sturdy, so problem areas are less noticeable.","Basically, I loved this dress.","I felt sexy, yet appropriate for the wedding I was attending.","I would order it again."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a recent wedding and liked it.","I received several compliments.","Other reviewers are right, it is a bit low cut (I had to continually adjust to make sure my chest was good).","The fabric is nice and the shape of the dress is flattering.","I could sit and dance all night."
"wedding","great fit, snug at the waist but creates a flattering silhouette."
"wedding","Such amazing fabric, sits very well, does not wrinkle.","Love the bow at the neckline, this dress looked high-end.","Not too short on my 511 body, but I am very busty (34G) so I had to squeeze into both the 14 and 16.","Ultimately went with the 14 because it was not as baggy in the waist."
"wedding","Dress fit well.","I probably could have gone down a size but since this was my first order, I actually sized up on my second option.","The material is not breathable at all, so for a wedding where there was no air in an old factory in June...it was a bit hot.","I felt really good in this dress and got a lot of compliments.","When dancing started and I needed some more air, I turned it around and had a whole new dress!"
"wedding","This dress is really comfortable.","The fabric is light and flowy.","It was however a little long for me (Im 52).","The length did not prevent me from wearing it but I did need to hold it up when I was walking.","It was also a little big in the chest but not noticeable."
"wedding","As others have noted, the dress runs small.","I am usually a solid 0, but ended up wearing the 2.","At 54, it ended up being a midi dress on me, which was perfect.","The bodice provided enough support that I didnt need a bra, but larger busted ladies might have more issues.","The shoulders dont let you raise your arms very high.","It wasnt too much of a problem, but toasting across a table or really getting into Twist and Shout was a bit difficult.","I got compliments throughout the night from random strangers.","Its a beautiful dress."
"wedding","This was such a fabulous dress!","It was very simple but very flattering and the color is so rich!","It fit great but there is no stretch in the waist."
"wedding","Dress fit really well - tight, but in a flattering way thanks to the material."
"wedding","This was actually a back-up outfit sent with my original order.","I worn this to my rehearsal dinner and received SO many compliments.","The outfit itself is true-to-size, however the hem is extremely long.","I ended up using hollywood tape in order to do a temporary hem.","This outfit was sexy and classy and very comfortable!"
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress!","It was comfortable and sassy, all in one.","My only problem was there was no petite size.","The skirt still looked great and the dress sexy off the shoulder.","However, the arm holes were too large and my undergarments could easily be seen when I moved.","I easily solved the issue by wearing a blue tube top underneath.","I would definitely recommend this dress."
"wedding","This dress ran surprisingly large.","I am usually a size 10 in Badgley Mischka but the 8L fit really well.","The dress only gets 4 stars because the fabric appeared slightly worn.","I know its a popular rental, and it was looking a little tired.","As for the length, the 8 Long is LONG!","I had on 3.5 inch heels, and at almost 59, i was still tripping over myself all night.","The dress was super comfortable though, and looked great with a turquoise necklace!"
"wedding","Go a size up if youre in between!"
"wedding","When I first saw the XS I thought it wouldnt fit but after trying the S and having too much room I put the XS it fit perfectly.","It was form fitting but the lace hid any problem areas.","Loved the dress and would 100% rent again!","Once you have the dress on you cant put on deodorant or anything."
"wedding","This was a great LBD.","I had to use this dress as a backup because my other RTR dress didnt fit.","I usually dont like tight fitting dresses because my hips are wide so I was constantly pulling the dress down.","It was nearly impossible to go to the bathroom in because it was so tight on my hips I couldnt pull it up without a struggle!","I received a ton of compliments on it and it photographed really well."
"wedding","LOVED this dress!","It was SO comfortable.","I wore it with flat sandals and it was a bit long.","It would be the perfect length with a short heel.","The fabric is very light and worked out very well for a warm outdoor wedding.","I received many compliments.","It was the prefect mix of classy and sexy.","Fit like a glove!"
"wedding","Perfect dress for a fall/winter wedding.","It was very comfortable to wear.","I ordered a 4 and a 6.","The 4 fit perfect.","Fabric has a bit of a stretch to it which is nice.","Highly recommend it!"
"wedding","The dress fit amazingly.","I just had a baby and am carrying that baby weight so I wanted something that would mask my midsection and this was perfect.","I never-ever wear my arms out but my stylist, Moriah, told me that sometimes you have to show what you are trying to hide and she was right.","As soon as I tried on the dress I felt good about the fit and my arms didnt bother me one bit!"
"wedding","Fits great.","Got a lot of compliments"
"wedding","This was my first time using Rent the Runway and I had a great experience.","The dress arrived on time and I was promptly notified that it had been delivered when I sent it back.","Some thoughts on the dress itself: Pros:-This is a great color (I would say it looks a bit more pink than in the photo) and I really liked the lace detail -I often struggle to find dresses small enough to fit me (size 0s are often not really size 0s anymore) and was pleasantly surprised by this one.","Cons: -this dress runs small; without the hidden zipper running most of its length, I wouldnt have been able to fit in.","This isnt a con per se, just something to bear in mind!","-Hard dress to dance in - theres no stretch to the bottom half of the dress at all.","Its a true sheath, so if you want to swing around on the dance floor (or even take long strides while walking), thatd be tough.","-Conversely, the top half of the dress is not AS snug  - although the dress didnt slip, I was really worried that it would.","I would wear this dress again, but probably not for a wedding."
"wedding","As other reviewers said, this jump suit is SO FLATTERING!","I wore it to my wedding after party and my husband was blown away!","He didnt want me to give it back!","It was also SUPER comfortable.","I ordered a 2 and a 4 and wound up wearing the 4, so it ran a tiny bit small on me, but the length was perfect."
"wedding","This dress is really comfortable and the color is spectacular.","That being said, I received a 6 and an 8 equivalent, and both were quite loose.","They also didnt have any size labels, which made it tough to tell the difference.","I could have gone down to a 2 and a 4 in this, it was so stretchy.","I probably could have gotten away with the larger size, but I just didnt love how it looked a little too baggy.","Will absolutely rent again in the right sizes."
"wedding","I am a 36DD and this dress fit like it was made for me.","The material has a little stretch to it and the blue satin ruffles are pretty on the dress.","I am 54, 135 lbs and for me, the dress fit perfectly.","Not too short and the end is not too long."
"wedding","Little snug around rib cage but otherwise very comfortable and flattering.","Love the color."
"wedding","I loved wearing this dress.","Shoshona tends to run large, so I would order your regular size, then the smaller size.","I am typically a 6, and every time I order a Shoshona dress, I get a 6 and a 4, and I always end up wearing the 4!","The dress is basically backless, so you cant wear a regular bra.","I wore adhesive cups which worked fine.","The dress also has pockets and is generally very comfortable to wear."
"wedding","The neck did droop a little bit when I would lean forward but everything else fit great ...","I was going to wear the 12 but it was a snug fit and I had my 2 year old with me so the 14 was better for me to bend over and pick him up.","Other than that it was a beautiful dress and I would rent it again!!","!"
"wedding","This was the perfect dress for a september saturday night wedding.","If your tall i wouldnt recommend because it was borderline to short on me.","I received a ton of compliments!","!"
"wedding","This dress was amazing!","It definitely runs small so I went up a size, but it hugged all the right places and is great for someone who has some curves.","The color is a bit darker than what the model is pictured in but still a beautiful grey/blue.","The material is thick so it was a bit warm for a Southern spring wedding but was definitely nice when the weather cooled off at night.","I would definitely rent again!"
"wedding","At the time of ordering only the 4 was available so it was pretty tight.","There is a slight stretch to it, but not much so dont count on that.","You can wear a regular strapless bra with no problem and I wore it with Spanx shorts.","The only problem was that due to the tightness and high neckline, when I sat down I got choked a bit!","As they say, pain is beauty...","I received tons of compliments and my boyfriend loved it!"
"wedding","Fits like a glove, the length is perfect for heels too!","Its so comfortable you forget youre wearing a gown and I definitely didnt want to return it.","The only note I would add is: the fabric is on the thicker side, so I would suggest wearing this for a fall/winter/early spring event.","My event was in March, so it was perfect for the change in temperature going from day to night."
"wedding","The fit was fabulous.","The gown flowed nicely over the hips and bum, accentuating ever so slightly.","The problem I faced was in the bust area.","I am small chested and was very aware all night about the amount of skin showing.","The bust are was a little big on me.","Other than that, I absolutely loved the gown"
"wedding","Loved this dress.","Fit was comfortable and flattering.","The size 8 zipped with no issues although was definitely more fitted through the bust 34D  for me as I would expect.","Length was perfect.","I thought it might be long as I am only 54 but it worked out well.","Received tons of compliments as it is such a unique dress with beautiful detailing and definitely made a statement."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a rehearsal dinner and loved it!","Got ton of compliments,Pros: extremely flattering cut, pattern is fun, can wear a regular bra, fabric really sucks you in.","I have a large bust and am usually between a 6 and an 8, but rented the 8 and 10 because reviews said to size up.","The 8 fit perfectly, I didnt even try to the 10 on.","Cons: I didnt love the placement of the slit - it was more in the front of my thigh rather than to the side.","And, since I am 5 8 it was a lot of leg ...if you are on the taller side just keep that in mind.","I couldnt wear the shorts-style spanx which ended up being fine because the fabric keep everything in.","Other thing to note is the blue has a little shine to it which shows up when you take pictures with flash.","Overall, a great choice!"
"wedding","I am usually a size 2, but I rented the 0 hoping it would fit.","It did!","I read literally everyones review and gathered that the bust was a little large but the rest of the dress was true to size.","This worked out in my favor because Im a 32DD but a size 27/2 in pants.","So depending on the designer I can wear a 0, 2 and 4.","If you have a normal/small bust, I would size down for this dress.","Larger busts can probably wear their normal size or even go down one if small in the hips.","I wore this for a New Years Eve wedding and felt very glam and sophisticated.","It reminded me of something Jennifer Aniston would wear.","I would caution everyone however, that sitting in Church it felt a little risque, so I kept my coat draped over my legs.","Would definitely rent again or purchase!"
"wedding","The fit was a comfortable for me--large enough in the bust, but could have been a little smaller in the waist and hips.","A 14W may have fit better, but not available.","Very pretty lace -- had to mend in a few places that were torn at corners of the neck line.","Felt appropriately dressed for an evening wedding -- a little fancy but not over the top."
"wedding","I loved this dress!","It definitely runs small as I have never worn a size 10 in anything before.","I was worried that it would be too short but it wasnt.","The 8 probably fit better on top but I have a big butt and the bottom was TIGHT, so I wouldnt have been able to dance.","All and all I felt great wearing this dress to a wedding, I felt classic and a little bit sexy, not over the top.","Would be cute with tights in the winter too.","Probably not great for a hot, summer event as it is pretty thick and structured."
"wedding","It was super flattering for my figure and I loved the fabric.","I have a full chest, so I was worried that it may not fit well, but there were no issues at all.","Love this dress!"
"wedding","Beautiful dress; rented for a friends wedding.","Received tons of compliments.","The dress is very form-fitting and low cut.","The top of my bra kept peaking out so make sure you wear appropriate undergarments.","I also had a problem with the slip riding up.","It wasnt uncomfortable, just a little bit annoying.","Despite these two very minor issues, I adored this dress."
"wedding","very comfy!"
"wedding","Fit was true to size, however definitely better for an A/B cup.","It was a bit long, I wore 4 inch wedges to compensate.","Overall, super cute and got lots of compliments."
"wedding","The dress fit well.","Pockets are always a plus and the shape of the dress is comfortable, leaving room around the stomach and hips.","The lace around the neckline isnt as prominent as it is on the model so I chose to wear a simple pearl necklace.","When sitting down the slip underneath shows a bit but that didnt bother me.","I got a lot of compliments.","I would definitely recommend this dress!"
"wedding","this dress ran large but was overall very pretty.","i am normally between a 0 and 2 but the 0 on this was already a little large and wasnt a tight fit around the waist.","the dress still looked nice and i was very pleased with it, but i wish i had been able to order it in a petite-- i think that would have fit better.","its also a little bit long so again, if you are shorter, be prepared that it will probably come down to your knees.","I wore it to a vineyard wedding with rosegold/nude wedges which looked nice but maybe a little casual for the fanciness of the lace.","I think it would have looked better with heels, but it just wasnt practical on the grass."
"wedding","This dress is one of my favorites on RTR.","It’s tight on the shoulders and bust, but I would rather it be tight than loose and have the straps slip.","IT ALSO HAS POCKETS which was so convenient!","The blue skirt is a nice wintery shade and I fit in perfectly at this winter wedding.","The shape of the dress creates an incredibly flattering figure and it was comfortable enough to wear—and dance in—all day.","I especially love the neckline and had no problem finding a bra that works with the dress.","Would highly recommend!"
"wedding","I wore 12L and it was perfect.","Im curvy and this dress is perfect if you are curvy.","It looks better in real life than in pictures.","I never wore anything sparkly before ( i live in NY and sparks are not our thing) but Im glad I gave it a try:) rent it, youll shine to the best dressed list of the night"
"wedding"," Lightweight, no wrinkling, no fashion tape, no fuss, and very flattering.","I got so many compliments!","It was the perfect dress to wear.","I agree with other users in that the picture doesnt do it justice.","The pattern is so bold and bright in person.","Would love to wear again!","I paired with gold earrings, and bracelet, and gold heels."
"wedding","This dress was beautiful.","The color is much more beautiful in person.","I am 50 and short wasted.","It would have fit better if my torso was longer.","The sleeves fell off my shoulders a few times...oops It was VERY low cut.","I wore the new bra and even then sometimes the bra showed.","I do recommend this dress.","Just be cautious if you are short wasted.","And isnt my husband sooo handsome?","!"
"wedding","I sized up 1 size from normal since I am 13 weeks pregnant, and it fit perfectly!","I got so many compliments on this dress.","I would definitely rent again."
"wedding","The dress was a true long as I had to wear kitten heels and Im nearly 511.","You must have small bust to wear this dress in my opinion.","I got 100 compliments!"
"wedding","Fits snug around torso and chest.","The straps are long as others mention, but not too terrible.","Got lots of compliments!"
"wedding","Loved the look and feel of this dress.","The side slit was perfect and the neckline was elegant, especially paired with an updo.","I wore the 0R and did have to use hem tape, but Im only 52 so thats not unusual.","Got compliments all night - would definitely recommend and rent again!"
"wedding","I generally wear a 6 in Elizabeth and James but it wasnt available so I decided to try and stuff myself into a 4.","It worked!","It ended up being a little more sexy since it was super tight but all in all was a great dress.","Its kind of short, but maybe wouldnt have been had I worn a 6.","I did feel like the detail on the bottom of the dress got lost since its so dark, which is a kind of a bummer."
"wedding","I am normally a size 6, ended up wearing the 4 which was my backup size but wish I had a 2!","Go two sizes down unless you have a large bust."
"wedding","I wore this to a steamy Memorial Day weekend wedding in North Carolina.","Nothing will keep you cool in 90 degree weather, but this dress was breathable.","I got tons of compliments, and I felt beautiful in it.","If youre tall, either wear flats or pass this one up because its SHORT.","It was fine with heels on my 52 frame.","It was fun to twist and twirl in.","Also, the hem is kind of funky and flops up and over a bit.","Like everyone says, size UP.","I couldnt even get the 4 over my ribcage.","Overall I would rent this again.","Im convinced it would look good on anyone."
"wedding","The dress is beautiful-- heavy material with vibrant colors and a slight sparkle which is not obvious from the pictures.","I wore it on an unexpectedly hot (80deg) day but it was ok in this weather-- would be better if cooler.","I agree w others it runs a bit tight I could barely zipper the 6 so wore the 8 but it was slightly long in the waist.","Still worth it though!"
"wedding","This dress was so comfortable and sexy at the same time!","I was early in my pregnancy (12 weeks, 2nd baby) and didnt know how much i would be showing by then so i went with a more drapey dress.","The neckline is VERY low and shows a lot of cleavage, but I read reviews ahead of time and got the fashion tape which worked perfectly and stayed all night.","I do wish the slit in the dress was more noticeable, but if you hold it just right it looks great in the pictures.","Im glad i wore a comfortable dress with a bit of sexy in the neck line!"
"wedding","I wore this dress last weekend to a wedding and can say the only time Ive ever received more compliments was at my own wedding!","It definitely stuck out and I felt absolutely gorgeous all weekend long!"
"wedding","The dress is fitted but as mentioned, the fabric was thick enough to be flattering.","I loved the neckline and had compliments on the color.","I wore the dress with some 3 heels and it was a good length for my height with a petite sizing."
"wedding","I thought the dress was pretty, and it fit me well and I received many compliments.","It was somewhat trendy with the crinoline skirt, but it was a trendy crowd of people so it worked out.","Maybe not my favorite dress or fit (Ive got a short torso, so the top was a bit looser than I would have liked), but still very pretty."
"wedding","Comfortable and beautiful dress!","Loved the back.","A little tight for me in the hips but that is the norm for my body type!"
"wedding","Fits snugly around the hips and bottom - not a lot of stretch or give for dancing/movement.","However otherwise runs true to size.","Got a thousand compliments!"
"wedding","I went to the store in downtown Chicago to make sure that I could get something that fit correctly, and as someone who usually runs a 16, the 14W fit well.","It was a little snug at the arms and I have more than a bit of a belly and the dress would ride up above my belly - but it was great, and looked fabulous."
"wedding","I got so many compliments!","This was one of the most comfortable dresses I have worn in a while.","It is perfect for any occasion!"
"wedding","Fit like a glove, wasnt too short with heels and the color, details and structure made it perfect for a formal event."
"wedding","Both sizes that I ordered fit (the 8 perfectly and the 10 a bit loose).","I ended up wearing the 8 and was comfortable all evening.","There was one issue with the dress, but I contacted RTR and they were quick to respond and assist in anyway they could.","I will definitely rent again, as it was affordable and definitely earned a lot of compliments.","The only con I have is that I had to go without a bra, as my strapless was showing when I was wearing it.","This was just an issue with me and my bust size (32G)."
"wedding","The dress I received was a bit stretched out, especially in the stomach area.","However, the beautiful color of the dress stood out in all of the pictures from the night, and made up with the slight defect."
"wedding","I am a true size 4 and this dress fit perfectly.","The colors were summery, the fabric was high-quality, and it was a perfect dress for the occasion."
"wedding","True to fit- a little longer then I expected (hit just above my ankles) but still short enough to wear with 3 inch wedges without touching the ground."
"wedding","This dress has good stretch and it made me feel so good all night!","I got so many complements on it.","The off the shoulder sleeves are also stretchy so you can move your arms without a problem.","Love it."
"wedding","The fit of this dress is very flattering - it has a mermaid cut while emphasizes all the right areas.","Lots of complements all night, however it is a bit plain so be sure to wear statement earrings or a fun purse."
"wedding","the only reason I am marking runs small is in the arms.","The dress is beautiful and the underlay is almost like a spanx from the waste up.","The lace work on the arms is not very giving so if you have muscular arms or thicker arms it is a little tight....especially when picking up your arms etc...","Note I would not wear this if it were hot outside several layers to the dress would make it uncomfortable.","Other the pro side absolutely lovely color and worked well for a cooler outdoor wedding.","The dress has amazing detail and I received several compliments."
"wedding","very heavy fabric, great length, a bit bulky and too large.","I shouldve sized down"
"wedding","This gown is stunning in fact everyone that I walked by made the comment of how stunning this dress was.","Now for the downside....if you have a larger bust area buy some fashion tape to make sure your boobs arent showing."
"wedding","This dress was so comfortable and cool!","I loved the patterns and the fit was super flattering.","Fit true to size for me and I just loved it.","Wish I could have kept it!","Ive been doing RTR for awhile now and they never let me down."
"wedding","Im very tall, at 6, and it hit just at the knee, a little above.","I usually wear a size 10 or 12.","It was really comfortable and hugged me in all the right places.","I was nervous that I wouldnt be able to wear a regular bra (Im a 38 DD), but I just pulled the straps down a bit and it was fine.","Not an issue at all."
"wedding","This dress is very pretty in person.","Im tall and found that I needed to size up for length reasons.","The smaller size was a little short on me, and the waist sat a little too high."
"wedding","This dress was awesome!","The pictures online dont do the coloring justice.","Really pretty.","It fit pretty well too.","Im normally a size 8 and wore the size 8.","The top was a little big for me, but Im small chested (A cup) and normally need things taken in.","It wasnt noticeable, just if I owned the dress, I would have had the top taken in slightly.","The waist and length were perfect."
"wedding","the dress fit perfectly and was true to size, great for any occasion"
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding and loved it.","I usually get annoyed with off the shoulder dresses because I cant lift my arms up, but the fabric on this was stretchy making it more comfortable and easier to move.","If you are in doubt I would definitely size up.","Im between a 2 and a 4 and the 4 was a bit snug for me.","The dress fit quite tightly around the waist area but that also make it flattering.","The fabric on the bottom is really pretty  - it has accents of pale purple and light metallic gold."
"wedding","Perfect fit, totally comfortable, sexy but classy.","Created smooth lines and a great silhouette.","Did not have to adjust or fuss with the straps, waist, or skirt at any time.","Highly recommend."
"wedding","I loved the dress!","I felt like a queen.","It was also very comfortable!"
"wedding"," Beautiful colors and soft fabric.","Backless - my tan line ruined it :("
"wedding","Fit so nicely.","I am usually a size 8 pants and a small/medium in tops.","I ordered a 6 & 4 in this dress and ended up wearing the 4.","I thought it was a beautiful color and fell perfectly on me.","I got tons of compliments at the wedding and so many people commented on my Facebook photo-it photographs very well, too."
"wedding","I felt so confident and sexy in this gown I would give it 10 stars if I could.","The fit was perfect, I received tons of compliments, and I felt amazing and comfortable in it!","I would recommend this dress for any formal affair."
"wedding","Great dress - perfect for a wedding.","It does run large so consider a size down."
"wedding","Super flattering and gorgeous dress - received compliments ALL night.","I will definitely be renting this one again.","Im about a size 4 or 6 but the Medium fit best as I could not get the Small zipped shut.","Fun and flirty skirt and just the right length for my 57 frame.","LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!","!"
"wedding","Love love love...I usually wear a size down in dresses, but with this cut, the 6 was perfect.","I am obsessed with this dress, and partner now wants to buy it.","Definitely a good sign!"
"wedding","While I ended up wearing my first choice dress, this fit great for my usual dress size.","There was some stretch, and the length worked well with my heels."
"wedding","The dress fit my figure perfectly and I got so many compliments on it too!","The material is a bit heavier and a little shiny (almost taffeta like) but still classy and not cheap looking.","I would highly recommend this dress to any of my friends!"
"wedding","Loved everything about it.","My friend in the pic also did RTR and we both loved our dresses."
"wedding","I wore this at a summer wedding on a hot day and although the material is a little heavier it was perfect, didnt show any heat and I didnt feel hot.","Classic, beautiful and very easy to accessorize to create different looks.","Received so many compliments; wish I could buy it!"
"wedding","I thought the dress was beautiful but I didnt end up wearing it.","It was too big-just not the right fit for my body."
"wedding","I ordered this size in the S and M because the XS was out (I would have guessed that I wore a small, and others said it ran large).","It fit a little loose in the tummy area, but fit perfect in the sleeves and hips.","Even though I would have liked it to be a bit tighter, it was a gorgeous dress.","I got tons of compliments that night and on my picture.","I even had a friend several months later ask to borrow the dress."
"wedding","Nice dress.","It runs a little small, but it is very pretty!"
"wedding","I rented this for a November wedding.","It was seasonally appropriate and comfortable.","I will say, the style of the dress is not that flattering, but I knew that before I rented it.","Im rather large chested, so it wasnt figure flattering (more of a shift dress).","I still loved it though, and it looked really pretty in pictures!","Definitely dont size up!","!"
"wedding","Very flattering maxi.","Would have felt too low cut if I were a busty lady though.","Since the fit of the dress is loose from the bust down, most gals can probably size down.","I am usually a 4, but even the size 2 felt plenty big for me.","Would love to rent this dress again."
"wedding","The dress fits incredibly well, is hot and can suit really any body shape.","I am an hour glass with a bit of a bigger bottom.","So its often hard for me to find dresses that fit well.","This dress was perfect and Id recommend to anyone needing a cocktail hot tamale."
"wedding","I am not sure what body type it is made for- definitely not mine.","Skin hung out on the sides and it was not at all flattering.","The torso is pretty narrow, which is typical for higher end designers.","had it fit in the lower torso, the upper portion would have been too big- just not designed for my proportions."
"wedding","I didnt end up wearing this as I had another dress I liked more; it is gorgeous indeed and fits like a glove however under upper arm chappage would have been a guarantee unless one succeeded in keeping your arms out all night (probably would have looked great on the shoulders)."
"wedding","I positively adore this dress.","Im quite muscular through the arms and upper body, as well as through my legs and booty.","As such, Im always nervous that dresses with sleeves, or dresses that are tight through the thighs, wont fit me.","This dress, however, provided the perfect amount of stretch to allow for a snug but comfortable fit.","As other renters noted, if youre taller (Im 59) the dress is a bit shorter than on the model; but, it still hit just slightly below the knee for me.","I received compliments all night long and would highly recommend this dress!"
"wedding","A little hard to get into.","You really have to squeeze your head through the straps so do your hair AFTER you put on the dress.","I have a small bust so I didnt even wear a bra since there was a good lining and the back is open enough it would have shown bra straps.","When I tried it on in the store, the lace covered my knees, but the one I got for the day of was a little shorter.","Im used to that though because I am tall.","Great dress!","Got lots of compliments."
"wedding","I was concerned that this dress wouldnt fit, it was only available in a size 2 and I typically wear a size 0.","After reading the reviews, which said it ran small, I decided to give it a try and am so glad I did.","It fit like a glove!","There were very minimal signs of wear, which considering this dress is mainly lace and tulle was shocking how good of condition the dress was in!"
"wedding","I loved this dress.","It feels amazing once you put it on.","I didnt have any trouble with the straps falling down, but I have wide shoulders.","I got compliments all night at the wedding I went to.","The only issue I had was that because I have a long torso, my hips dont fall where the dress wanted them to so I had to adjust the dress when I stood up.","No other complaints!"
"wedding","Im a size 4 with small bust.","The waist was fine, but the sleeves were too big.","There was a gap above my shoulder and it exposed my bra on the side.","I had to constantly adjust my dress (by pulling is down).","The dress was also longer than I expected, but I threw on some heels and it looked fine.","Besides all if its flaws, I got plenty of compliments."
"wedding","Rented this as a back up for a wedding and ended up changing into this for the reception because it was more comfortable to dance in.","The overall fit is loose in the bust and waist/back, but the length was perfect for shorter ladies.","You cant wear a bra with it, so take note when renting this dress.","The print is brighter in person and very fun."
"wedding","Fit wonderfully, Could maybe have gone down a size, but always better to be slightly loose than too tight.","The boning created nice shape and lines, and the open lace at the neckline and open back were really pretty.","Got tons of compliments!"
"wedding","Loved that I could wear a normal bra with this dress.","The material has a little stretch, but its very form fitting on curves.","The fabric is a little thicker which is nice - keeps you feeling sucked in :) and the ruffle is a nice detail.","Also loved that I could wear a normal bra - just racerback/crossed the straps since the sleeves are slightly cut in.","Great dress for a summer wedding, loved the color."
"wedding","I wore this as my wedding dress and loved it.","It was comfortable enough to wear all night, and I loved how minimal yet pretty the design was.","Im usually a dress size 8/10, but nothing but the 12 fit my boobs, and even that just barely.","I am 55 and the regular length fit me just right with 2 inch heels.","I dressed it up with a belt and big jewelry, but it looked lovely by itself, too.","I am so grateful I got to wear this beautiful dress for my wedding instead of a poofy, thousand dollar tailored mess I would have never worn again."
"wedding","I rented this for a rehearsal dinner.","I am normally an 8 so got sizes 8 and 10 and ended up wearing the 10, even though I barely fit into it.","Once I was able to finally zip it up, I will say, it was super flattering and I received lots of compliments throughout the evening."
"wedding","Fit was great - Definitely need a buddy to do the button  in the back and pasties as others have mentioned.","Length was a bit unique; not to the ankles but not above the knee, so its perfect for a wedding that youre not sure if its formal or relaxed.","Material was a bit thick, but not soft.","Careful that it can have pulls if youre wearing large jewelry."
"wedding","This dress was great because it was super comfortable and true to size.","Im 53 and usually the petite is still too long but this was great.","I was able to wear comfortable heels without the dress dragging on the ground.","The back was so fun too!"
"wedding","I had lost 25 pounds recently, so I was nervous about the fit, but the 8 fit perfectly on my 152 lbs, 54, curvy frame.","My fiance and I decided to do the legal marriage with just our parents six months before our actually wedding date (for complicated reasons that I dont need to get into!","), but this dress was perfect for feeling bridal for the mini-ceremony and dinner out without being an actual wedding dress.","As a busty girl, it was certainly a little more sexy and lowcut than I expected, but nothing that fashion tape couldnt fix (with the lace held in place, it looked great).","The lace on the back also wasnt cooperating, but I didnt mind and I probably could have fashion-taped that, too."
"wedding","#beachwedding"
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding.","It does not come on a long size, and I am 510, so it was a little short for me, but my friends said it was not too bad short.","You could actually see my shoes with this dress.","Its a pretty gold color.","Because  you could see my shoes!","I probably would not rent this one again.","RTR customer service was excellent."
"wedding","The main con, as mentioned by most other reviewers, is the fabric above the bust.","For me, fashion tape was the only way to prevent the dress from looking flappy (so much so that my friend who helped me tape it down said I had tiny blue wings over my chest.","Not the most flattering).","However, once youre taped in, the dress is beautiful.","Low cut and very heavy, but creates a great profile and the color truly stands out.","Lots of positive comments and turned heads!"
"wedding","This dress was a success!","I rented it for a wedding and loved everything about it- the fit, the color, and the full skirt!","I danced all night in it without a problem.","Could have been a LITTLE bit shorter (I barely 51) but the fullness of the skirt made it work.","I would recommend."
"wedding","Tight in the rib cage area.","I normally wear an 8 and the 10 was pretty tight.","Fit well through arms and hips though."
"wedding","Loved this dress for a new mexico wedding.","Glad I sized up because it was tight, but fun to dance in.","Sadly, someone at the wedding was in the same dress, but we both looked great."
"wedding","I wore this gown to the most incredible wedding in the Hollywood Hills in September.","The crowd was made up of my husbands friends that he had growing up in LA.","This Texas girl fit right in this crowd of fabulous people.","I do RTR for every wedding that I attend in LA, and I always get complements from my husbands friends about my looks.","RTR is totally my little secret!","This dress definitely had some stretch to it.","The train in the back is stunning, and the off the shoulder cut shows off a gorgeous neck line.","I went very simple with the jewelry and wore an open toed nude heel.","This is one of my favorite RTR looks yet."
"wedding","The dress was a gorgeous shade of blue, true to the color online (except it does not have a different color along the border).","I have a big butt and hips and it hid everything.","The top gave me cleavage, which I NEVER have.","The material was thick but not hot and despite having drinks dropped on me, it never looked wet.","And the high-low aspect was so fun, I was twirling all night :) The 6 fit me JUST right, so if youre busty or have a larger midsection, I would probably go up a size (I carry my weight in my arms and thighs so the tight waist was ok)."
"wedding","I wore this for a wedding ceremony because I was doing a reading and wanted something more conservative.","I added the necklace to bring out the pink in the dress.","The pockets make the bottom half poof out a little, which I didnt like but the print is really beautiful."
"wedding","This dress came in great condition.","I saw complaints of the length and crooked bow but being 53 and wearing 3 inch heals, the length was perfect and the bow was straight.","I got so many compliments in this dress it was unbelievable, I felt like a movie star.","This dress makes your butt look good too.","I would recommend it to everyone!","I didnt want to return it because I loved it so much."
"wedding","I rented this dress for a wedding and loved it!","I had rented another Clover Canyon dress in the past and I loved the comfortable fit and unique design.","This dress definitely shows off your curves so if you dont like  a bodycon fit, I would not recommend it.","This dress if so versatile it looked great with tights in the winter but would definitely work in the hotter months as well.","This was a great pick and something I would rent again!"
"wedding","Runs a teeny bit large, I probably could have worn the 6, but the 8 was fine with a bra.","Simple and no-fuss, but I still received a lot of compliments - I would definitely wear this dress again for another occasion."
"wedding","The dress is very pretty, but the zipper doesnt easily zip.","The fabric on the back of the dress changes, and the zipper gets stuck mid-back.","I had girlfriends trying to help me zip up and while the dress fit, the zipper wouldnt budge.","I had to wear my back up dress, which fortunately was gorgeous and worked out.","Anyhow, be warned that the zipper is tricky on this little number."
"wedding","I was excited about this dress but forgot to order the back-up.","ORDER THE BACKUP.","I couldnt get the zipper up.","Had to send it back.","Luckily, RTR was awesome and sent me a dress overnight that I LOVED so much more than this one.","So it all turned out great in the end."
"wedding","First time renter!!","#myrtr experience for the first time around was great.","The Monique Lhuillier dress was great for an evening rustic wedding.","I will say the dress was a little heavy with the lace overlay, but it looked amazing.","It does run true to size and extremely fitting in the top.","If you dont know your formal dress size then go a size bigger.","In photos the dress can make you look larger than you are, but it looks amazing in group pics.","All and all great experience and beautiful dress"
"wedding","I have a smaller chest so I gently used a safety pin to make sure that the deep V stayed together.","Bigger chested girls beware-you will definitely draw attention to that area!","The back is beautiful and the dress is flowy.","Purrrrfect for wedding eating & drinking to not be pudgy.","I would rent again!"
"wedding","I have an hourglass figure and was concerned about the flouncy-ness of the skirt but the length was great!","Warm enough for a November wedding because it was lined.","The fabric picks easy so be aware when youre trying our necklaces.","I had to buy a flat backed statement necklace out of fear of damaging the dress.","The arms are snug but other wise the fit was great!","!"
"wedding","This dress does run large, so even though I was nervous about getting my back-up size in a 4 (rather than an 8), I was glad I did!","The 6 was much too big and the 4 fit perfectly, with plenty of extra room in the waist.","Definitely required a petal/sticky bra which i bought for $30 at target.","Also the color was beautiful.","Looks much darker on the model than it was in real life.","The back of this dress is gorgeous.","I got many compliments throughout the night -- Wish I owned this one!"
"wedding","SO many compliments and the colors are gorgeous!","I am not normally a fan of a cap sleeve, but it was just enough to round out the shoulders.","It doesnt ride up, it is a nice heavy material that gives you credit where deserved!","Fun dress, paired with some spicy black sandals and a pop of bling in a bracelet to let the dress say it all!","Would definitely rent again!"
"wedding","The dress was extremely comfortable and looked elegant without being too over-the-top.","I wore it to an evening wedding, mostly indoors.","I wore a regular bra without an issue.","The dress was thick enough and patterned in such a way that I was able to wear control-top pantyhose without any lines showing.","Awesome!"
"wedding","Runs really small - keep in mind UK sizes and then go 1 or 2 sizes up from there!","It was a little tight on my arms but overall just hugged my curves well."
"wedding","Loved this dress -- SO fun!","I got so many compliments on this dress -- the look is perfect for a fancy event, but I paired it with converse for an outdoor wedding.","Looked adorable!","This dress ran true to size with a little bit of stretch in the fabric.","There are not really any embellishments, but cool open mesh stripes at the bottom of the skirt.","The dress zipped up the back with a hook and eye closure.","This dress would not work for bigger bust sizes.","The waist fit is fitted with a fuller skirt -- very comfortable through the hips.","The neckline is very flattering (I wore it with pearls).","The sleeves were very comfortable and did not gap.","The dress was very flattering!"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a wedding in Arizona.","The fabric of the dress is very thick and so it was a bit toasty.","Also the dress was a little stretched out and bunchy in places especially when I sat down.","I did get a tone of compliments on the dress!","There was also another girl at the wedding who had the same dress in black!"
"wedding","Wore this to a Wedding and received many complements.","Very happy with the style and fit, although I did need to cuff it (Im 53 with short legs).","Super easy to dance in and would wear again if I had a wedding to attend with a different group!"
"wedding","This dress was a HUGE hit at an outdoor wedding.","Its absolutely beautiful and very flattering - and also comfortable.","I had tons of compliments.","Wish I could have kept it!","!"
"wedding","The material and detail on this dress is beautiful.","I wish I had gotten a 6 as a backup because I think that would have been an even better fit.","Definitely reccomend."
"wedding","My 3rd RTR dress worked out but I will say its my least favorite so far only because the ribbon at the waistline had no give at all.","I was never uncomfortable to the point where I wished I could take the dress off but the ribbon occasionally reminded me to make sure I kept things sucked in even wearing Spanx.","I ordered a 4R but I had to wear the 6P backup due to the ribbon over-cinching my waistline (I plan on eating & drinking all day you know!).","I would still recommend this dress, I got multiple compliments, and the green sheen of the lace was beautiful when it caught light.","I felt beautiful and didnt have to worry about the lower belly being accentuated as it drapes nicely.","The length of 4R and 6P both fit me well and my heels were only 2.5 at most.","If you have similar measurements (34C-28-36) and height, its worth trying out but I would still recommend my 2 previous rentals over this.","I previously rented Shoshanna Fielding Flowers Dress | Size 4 and Nicole Miller Lady in Waiting Gown | Size 4R."
"wedding","It was perfectly comfortable.","Hard to walk up stairs but I danced all night with no issues!","Stretchy, so my fellow figure ladies, you will NOT need to worry about it being tight after wedding dinner/drinking :)"
"wedding","I originally thought Id be a size 10, but it did not fit very well over my hips.","The 12 fit like a glove though!","The sleeves made it a little hard to reach my arms above my head, but I still felt I could dance normally at the reception.","The lace detailing is so pretty!","I received so many compliments!"
"wedding","I ordered a size 8 and 6 and the 6 fit perfectly.","This could be worn without a bra but I used a Nu bra to fill it out a little more.","The hem for the attached slip underneath did a weird thing where it poked out more than it should but I think that was to make the dress go out more."
"wedding","The fabric has a nice sheen to it and it was a flattering fit.","I gave the dress 4 stars instead of 5 because the back zipper was always coming down.","Im glad I had a different RTR dress for the reception because I wouldnt have been able to dance with the zipper problem."
"wedding","Got this as my back up dress and didnt end up wearing it....but it was too short even though I ordered a 4L.","Im 59 and 1/2 with 3 inch heels the dress fell to my ankles.","The color was lighter than what is shown online but the fabric was really nice and the fit was great."
"wedding","Very glamorous dress.","I got compliments on it all night however I was falling on the edge of it while dancing bc it was so long."
"wedding","Im in between the height requirements for the dresses - Im 56.75.","So I rented the long, and figured with the extra height from my 4.5 heels Id be fine.","Not so.","I still had a tiny train and of course I was paranoid about that.","The built-in corset was clutch.","I also wore some extra-strength Spanx underneath - its the type that goes up to just under ones bra, and it wasnt visible at all.","I will say, I got some hips, and with the corset and Spanx and tight, I felt like I could not breathe.","I felt like I could have gone with the 8.","But everyone assured me I looked fine in the 6 and should wear it, and I definitely could move.","(I didnt rent the 8 as my backup.","S-M-R-T) People came up to me and complimented the dress so much.","(whether thats the dress wearing me, or just that I looked awesome and the dress was great too, you decide) Its really just as lovely in person as it is online."
"wedding","Great color!"
"wedding","I rented this dress for a wedding in Seattle and I was beyond thrilled with it!","I got both a 10 and a 12 and they both fit and would have worked but I went with the 10.","It was a little more form fitting but not so much that it was uncomfortable.","The color was beautiful and looked awesome outside in the sun and inside under the lights.","The back was eye catching and comfortable.","The dress was well made and easy to wear and move in.","I was unable to wear a regular strapless bra with it so I bought one of those adhesive ones that stick to your sides and that worked perfectly.","I also wore spanx just to make myself feel better but I dont think that it was needed.","It was a bit warm at the wedding both outside and inside at the reception but this dress did not show a bit of sweat, thank the lord.","Overall this dress rocked and I would love to rent it again."
"wedding","I did not expect to fall so in love with it when I ordered it, but it fit like a glove and added some sexiness!","It was comfortable to dance in as well!","Was tighter than other dresses Ive gotten in a four, but it worked well for me."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding in Hawaii and it was perfect.","The colors are beautiful and the dress felt amazing.","The way the fabric moves when you walk makes it look like you are gliding.","It is by far my favorite RTR rental to date.","I wore a 2R which was the perfect length with my flat sandals.","I usually wear a size 0, but the 0R was not available so I rented 0L as my backup.","The 0L was a better fit for me, but was too long with my flat shoes.","Even though the 0R would have been the perfect fit and length, I was very pleased with the 2R and I would highly recommend this dress."
"wedding","This dress fits true to size.","I wore a 6 - I am 53 and 128 lbs...with all the beautiful sequins, I couldnt fully raise my arms when dancing and I think this dress gets rented a lot, as many of the sequins were turned up on the back and the arms.","Also, the dress had a strange smell - not sure of it was just a combination of perfumes, foods, etc.","All in all, the dress made me feel very sexy and confident.","Glad I rented it!"
"wedding","I wore this dress to a winter wedding in New York City.","I am 511, and I wore the size 2L.","I wore low (<2 inch) heels, and the dress landed perfectly for me.","Gorgeous dark navy, sturdy fabric that is forgiving.","I paired the dress with a beaded belt for extra waist definition (this probably shortened the overall length a bit as well).","Very comfortable for a long night of dancing.","The picture of this dress may not grab your attention immediately, but it is beautiful in real life with a simple elegance."
"wedding","Great dress, perfect for a summer wedding in 100% humidity!","I loved the fit and the colors, you can wear a regular bra with this and it has pockets.","The colors are much brighter in person than they are online (you cant tell in my picture), and it was fun to find accessories to make the colors pop.","Wore with nude strappy sandals and cobalt blue earrings."
"wedding","The dress was extremely comfortable and flattering.","I received a ton of compliments on it!","The straps are a little loose but the bust of the dress is tight enough that I wasnt worried about it falling down.","If I could purchase this dress I would!","Absolutely would recommend"
"wedding","This dress is just absolutely amazing!","The fit is amazing, the color is amazing, the lace detail is amazing!","I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!"
"wedding","High quality, very flattering fit"
"wedding","I normally wear a 4 and wore a 4 in this dress, but felt it was a little tight.","I loved it though and got tons of compliments!","Perfect for a November wedding in Michigan.","Would definitely rent again."
"wedding","This dress is very well made and overall quite comfortable.","My only complaint would be that the lining of the dress would stick to my nylons and get bunched up.","The dress is tight fitting in the legs, so walking and stairs were somewhat of a challenge at times, but nothing I couldnt handle.","Im short (52) and this dress was just the perfect length in 3in.","heels- if you are any taller and plan on wearing heels, Id go with the tall size."
"wedding","The dress was perfect.","I wasnt sure that a sheath dress was going to look good on me because my lower stomach area is my biggest issue, luckily I took a chance.","I felt AMAZING in this dress.","Super comfy and very stretchy.","I probably could have sized down but I think I would have felt self conscious about my stomach area.","Dress was in perfect condition, no issues with the zipper or wrinkles or weird smells.","This was my first rental and Ill DEFINITELY be renting again.","I got compliments the entire night.","I loved every second."
"wedding","A really great dress.","Fit well with my large bust (28/30 E/F) and looked classy but sexy.","Im sad that I didnt actually wear it to the wedding but my backup dress was the winner.","I will definitely rent this one again!"
"wedding","I got an 8L and 10L because 6L wasnt available.","The mid-section was definitely roomy, but Im pretty busty, so the top fit just right.","Will say - this dress is *super* sexy.","The bride at this wedding is a close friend who encouraged such dresses, but I honestly wouldnt recommend it for any other wedding!","Material is on the thicker side, but it wasnt too hot in LA 80 degree weather.","Ive seen a lot of notes about the side mesh panel making undergarments tricky: Get a nude body-shaping bodysuit from Amazon.","So clutch."
"wedding","True to size.","No give.","Size up if you are unsure."
"wedding","Fit was body hugging.","Nipped in at the waist and hugged hips/butt.","True to size but not much room for error!","Great thing is no bra needed because of the hidden bustier that you hook like a bra.","Not the most comfortable dress in the world, but I loved it."
"wedding","Beautiful dress - its a nice dark teal color with a touch of black in the lace.","I ordered the 8 and 10, because I do have broad shoulders and based on other reviews some people had sized up, but the 8 ended up fitting me better.","The arms were a little on the tight side but it didnt really bother me.","One thing I really liked about this dress was that I was able to wear a regular nude color bra (as opposed to strapless) without it showing through the lace.","I received many compliments!"
"wedding","I was 140lbs when I wore this dress.","Extremely flattering & figure hugging for my hourglass shape!","The gown has a bit of stretch to it, so I was very comfortable dancing the night away!"
"wedding","This dress was perfect for a Spring wedding!","I received many compliments from the fit, color, and detail.","The only thing Id watch out for is the length.","Im 54 and this dress was pretty short on me.","While sitting down I used a napkin over my lap for extra security.","Other than that, this dress was perfect.","I wish I owned this one.","Thanks RTR!"
"wedding","Fit was perfect!"
"wedding"," It fit well and hid all the things I wanted while on weight loss journey.","LBD that worked perfectly for a daytime wedding.","The 12 fit but I felt the 14 fir better in the chest area.","The slip had a tear but did not affect the overall fit of the dress."
"wedding","Wore this to a black tie wedding on NYE.","This was not the dress I intended to receive.","Same dress in gold was what I ordered, but RTR was having some issues, apparently.","Aside from the disappointment, it was an acceptable replacement.","My backup dress was also a Mischka Badgley.","But I only had it in a size 2L and it was not going to stay up around my chest without some fidgeting.","It also ran longer.","Im 58 and the L was good in this dress (perfect).","Dress does run large - would not typically call myself a 0.","A 2 or 4.","It was comfortable, easy to dance in at the wedding.","And it was a stand-out."
"wedding"," great dress!-definitely short but got a lot of compliments!"
"wedding","When the dress came in, it still had the tag on it!","Im 51 110 lbs.","and I was surprised that the dress fit a little looser than I would have liked.","It was still very comfortable and was perfect for a fall wedding.","I did not wear a bra because the back was open.","Would recommend wearing cutlets to fill in the front for petite women."
"wedding","The dress fit great.","I couldve worn the small but the sides were a little looser so I wore the  XS.","I was a little uncomfortable going bra-less but the fabric is really thick so it wasnt too much of a problem.","It was a fun dress to wear and I loved the pockets!"
"wedding","I was sad to send this dress back!","The fit was perfect for my hourglass figure and the color was bright and beautiful!","Not to mention the bra strap holders were super convenient!","I would definitely recommend this dress!"
"wedding","The dress fit perfectly.","I am 54, 110lbs and have a very small chest and narrow waist.","I would recommend this for someone with a smaller bust as I didnt need to wear a bra nor did I have any issues with it being too tight.","I do have a little bit of a but and runners legs so the tight bottom fit perfectly and didnt ride up or be too loose.","The best part of the dress are the slits.","You show some leg from the side but then you look conservative from the front.","I loved everything about the dress.","I felt sexy and comfortable all night.","I paired the dress with a raffeta clutch, some colorful earrings, some bangles, and strappy nude heels for a gorgeous spring wedding.","The entire night, I got numerous compliments from the bridal party, the bride, other wedding guests, and my date.","Like I said, I love this dress and will 100% rent this again."
"wedding","Absolutely loved this dress!","Fabric was amazing.","I am 57 and wore about three inch heels.","The dress was a little short (you could see my shoes).","Probably would have been OK with the 10L.","Would definitely recommend!"
"wedding","I wore this to a friends wedding in the fall.","I loved the color,the fit and the length.","It is pretty form fitting and its vneck so it does show some cleavage.","I loved how I could wear a regular bra.","It was very comfortable."
"wedding","Everyone loved this dress, I was still getting compliments on it a week after the wedding.","The dress was very comfortable.","A tad big on the bust area, but overall a great fit."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding and got a ton of compliments!","It fits well, the fabric is comfortable, the color is beautiful and the bottom is so romantic and flowy.","Im 55 and wore the 0P; I wore flats and the length was perfect!"
"wedding","LOVED this dress!","I ordered the medium and large as the back up.","Very glad I ordered the large as this is what I ended up wearing.","It was smaller through the bust area.","I worried about the high neck as I am a 34D but it was perfect.","I am only 55 and I wore 2.5 inches but the dress was still long!","Luckily the slit made it easy to hold up.","Received so many compliments on this dress and would definitely order it again.","Just wish it came in a petite size!"
"wedding","This dress is a no brainer.","Its elegant, yet has a sexy open back.","The color is perfect and the silver shimmer makes it dressy enough for a wedding.","Id definitely rent this again!"
"wedding","Fits true to size.","The only problem I had was being short,I had to keep lifting it up when I walked,I wore kitten heels.","It can take a 3 inch heel,no problem.","Otherwise than that, its a great dress,nice and flow y!","I have another wedding in October,definitely will order from here again....."
"wedding","The beautiful sheen, soft animal print pattern, and fullness of its skirt all make this dress a stand-out.","My friend and I both wore RTR dresses to a wedding and loved our experience!","As soon as I walked in, I was approached by two women Ive never met who wanted to compliment this dress.","The material is very soft and comfortable, and its great for dancing!","The skirt is full and has a bit of a bell shape (especially in the back).","Its shape is very feminine and makes the wearer feel lovely in it!","I would definitely recommend this dress."
"wedding","Slit is high and the neckline is low so I felt a little bit exposed  but overall the color and fabric are beautiful"
"wedding","I ordered this for a bridesmaid dress in a friends wedding.","Saved me $200 thanks to RTR for having the same design that she wanted!","I ordered the 2R and 4R.","I couldve worn either size even being 15 weeks pregnant.","I went with the 2R because the top fit better.","The length was perfect with flats, Im 5 ft 6 for reference.","It is beautiful and very comfortable.","I got a lot of compliments and couldnt have been happier."
"wedding","Overall-The dress was absolutely stunning!","It was super flattering and sexy, yet classy enough to wear to a wedding.","I received compliments all night long!","Accessories-I paired it with the Elizabeth and James Logan Pendant Necklace (RTR) and Gorjana Mave Handpiece (RTR) and my own shoes&clutch from Aldo.","Bra-I had planned on wearing a plunge front/low back bra and decided not to as it wasnt necessary--the bow ties in the front for support, and the bra (just barely) peeked out the front and straps a bit in the back.","Zipper-the zipper on the side zipped up most of the way but not completely.","I ended up hooking the top clasp and just tied the front which covered it.","It definitely wasnt a size issue as I had plenty of room, it almost felt like it was a faulty zipper.","Nothing visibly wrong it just didnt fully zipper.","Color-I was initially worried to rent the dress due to the color (brides dress had a hint of pink) but the dress is definitely pink.","Someone described it as almost peachy pink which I dont completely agree with but it wasnt close to light white pink at all.","Recommendations-I definitely recommend renting this dress!","I would encourage double-sided tape for the chest but it is possible to dance the night away without it.","Id also recommend a jacket/shawl if youre wearing it into the night as even tho the material is thick, there is quite a bit of skin exposed.","The skirt is roomy & full so you do get a draft."
"wedding","Dress runs a bit large- I recommend sizing down if youre unsure.","Fantastic shape for those of us with narrow waists but large hips.","As others have mentioned, the bust is a bit large in comparison to the waist, but I felt fine in it wearing a relatively unpadded stick-on bra.","Length was longer than expected in the pics, and Im a tall lady."
"wedding","Thought the color and the lace was very elegant yet still on trend.","Tons of compliments!"
"wedding","Comfort all night long."
"wedding","I really liked this dress!","Got a ton of compliments!","Two things to keep in mind if you are petite and/or have a larger bust, though.","I felt like the pleats/piping made me look a little wider than I think I am (but they did help my nonexistent butt)--- and the sizing was a little off for my body type.","I could have worn a 0 in the waist, but a 0 definitely would not have fit me in the chest.","If the chest were any tighter, I honestly would have gone up to a 4.","I still say the dress fits pretty true to size though, because I feel like it would have been better for someone with more even proportions.","Oh, and you cant lift your arms in this.","Luckily, I wore this to the rehearsal--- so things hadnt got that crazy yet."
"wedding","Fits true to size.","The medium and small fit nearly the same.","I wore the small because it was a little more fitted and shorter.","Absolutely stunning dress!","You definitely need skinny arms to wear this dress.","Arm movement is slightly limited when, say, you try to reach up to do your hair.","Definitely do that before putting this dress on."
"wedding","This dress was absolutely beautiful in person.","It fit well and I think fits in such a way as to be very flattering for different body types.","I would highly recommend this dress."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a wedding in Manhattan and it was perfect for the occasion - sexy yet sophisticated.","Like other reviewers mentioned, the straps are long but its easy to fix or it can work for the very low cut  Kate Hudson sort of look."
"wedding","It fit true to size.","I have a larger chest and the dress was a little tight and I couldnt wear a bra."
"wedding","The dress fit well but was a little poofy.","I was bit self conscious and kept trying to hold it down all night but people said I was being silly!"
"wedding","I LOVED THIS DRESS!","It was absolutely beautiful!","I wore it to an outdoor wedding in September and it was perfect.","The material is even more beautiful than it looks online, and I received tons of compliments.","Im usually in between a small and a medium, so I ordered both and ended up going with the medium.","Both dresses fit, but the medium was just a bit more comfortable.","This was probably my favorite dress Ive rented from RTR!"
"wedding","It fit almost perfectly, just slightly snug around the rib cage.","The color is very vibrant and the fabric is very elegant.","And dont get me started on the pockets :) I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"wedding","I rented this dress as a wedding guest because the reviews made me feel it was appropriate.","I did not end up wearing this dress because it was extremely sparkly and I felt very heavy.","Even if you are smaller (Im 54, 122 lbs), I think if you have curves (Im a 34 full C) the dress makes you look heavier.","Recommend for less curvy and perhaps taller girls!"
"wedding","Typically Im a 4 but ordered a 6 per other reviewers advice and wore spanx underneath just to keep everything together."
"wedding","Was a bit tight, but a size up was way too large.","Could have worn a bra with it had I needed to, but it was tight enough through the bust that I could get away without one.","Paired nicely with some simple black pumps."
"wedding","Fit was pretty true to size- I am pretty broad through the ribcage, and the 4 was almost too tight, but I could still breath, dance, etc.","It was shorter than I thought also- RTR says model is 510 so I thought it would be longer on me but still pretty short.","Unfortunately the 6 was not available so I could not try out the next size up to compare.","Beautiful dress and I felt great all night!"
"wedding","The dress is super comfortable and flattering.","It is really well made and looks elegant.","I usually wear a size 4 and had to wear the size 0 and it was still a bit loose.","Definitely recommend sizing down."
"wedding","This is a great dress!","it runs true to size, i normally wear a size 4 but the arms were tight on me so i went for the 6 which was a little big, but also a little more comfortable.","The dress is much more purple than the picture shows...it photographs beautifully, I got compliments all night long.","Great pick!"
"wedding","This dress is amazing!!","It looks so beautiful on with a little sexiness in the split up the thigh.","I also found it very comfortable and easy to wear - I didnt need spanx, I didnt feel like I needed to suck-in my tummy, the length was right below the knee,  I didnt need to wear a special bra with it - it was all perfect.","I wish I could own this dress"
"wedding","I had a co-workers January wedding (live on the east coast so pretty cold in the winter months) and wanted something fancy/classy, but not too sexy.","This dress fit perfectly; I ordered the 4L and 6L.","Im usually a 4 in dresses, but my normal work pant and jean size is a 6.","The 4L fit great and I ordered the long size because I was wearing 3 inch heels so I didnt want the dress to be too short, otherwise I think the 4R would have fit.","I received so many compliments and the dress fit was exceptional - it hugged me where it needed to and gave some slack in other areas.","AWESOM AWESOME dress and a great experience with RTR --- will definitely be doing this again!!!","!"
"wedding","The dress was very flattering.","The only issue I had with it is that the V-neck was deeper than I anticipated.","Was a flattering length, even though Im on the petite side."
"wedding","I was worried about the fit around my chest...but it fit perfectly.","I am a little hippy and it actually slimmed me out and showed off the best parts of me."
"wedding","It was a little big in the chest area.","Deff need a padded bra if you are a size B or smaller.","Super flattering on bottom heavy people like myself."
"wedding","The dress was absolutely beautiful!","Many reviewers commented that it runs large and to size down, which I did, but I ended up wearing my normal size because I have muscular shoulders and a broader chest.","As a result, I could not close the back clasp on the smaller size.","However, it really wasnt a problem because the waist was still pinched well and the only place the dress gapped a bit was in the bum.","I felt the dress hit in a very flattering location at my knee, even though Im on the shorter side (nearly 53).","The color was also beautiful and unique.","Also, the dress was very comfortable (with a bit of stretch to it) throughout an entire day of wearing it through afternoon pictures and dancing until midnight.","Also, even though I have fairly sensitive skin, the fabric was not itchy, as some lace and sequin stitching can be.","Nothing but positive things to say about this dress."
"wedding","The fit was great, though it took some effort to get the zipper over the seam between the skirt and the bodice.","The material is pretty thick overall, so I got pretty warm when dancing, but overall it was beautiful and felt really glamorous.","Would totally rent this, or a similar dress, again.","55, 127lbs, 34A"
"wedding","Very comfortable and easy to move in.","Great for dancing.","I am a busty girl and the dress didnt slide down on me like I thought it would."
"wedding","Pros: This dress was beautiful!","I wore it to a Black Tie Optional wedding and received compliments all night!","It was just the right amount of class, but not too flashy.","I usually wear a size 0, but always order a 2 just in case, because of my hips and shorter torso.","However, this dress had a little bit of stretch that hugged my curves in all the right places.","The lace was also soft so there was no itching.","The shoulders hugged the edge of my shoulders, so I did not have to deal with the uncomfortable feelings of tugging at sagging sleeves all night.","Cons: I am a little petite and I regret only wearing 3 heels that night since it was a bit too long and my heel snagged on the dress.","I had to be careful when walking and made sure to kick the dress out a little.","Also, when I received the dress, I noticed that the thread near the seams were coming off, the result of being snagged from other wearers, so I had to trim the loose threads before donning the dress.","Other than that, the biggest Con is that I cant keep this dress forever!"
"wedding","I am obsessed with this dress.","I rented it for a formal wedding in Colombia and it was beyond perfect.","I felt amazing and got so many compliments - it was really different from a lot of the other gowns everyone wore and stood out (in a great way!).","I definitely did not want to send this back and will definitely rent in the future if I need another gown.","For any large bust girls as well this dress is perfect!","I have trouble fitting that area a lot and still having the dress fit in other areas and this was perfect.","Huge thanks to the girls at the NYC showroom as well who helped me settle on this dress for my event!","!"
"wedding",",,"
"wedding","Very pretty pattern, nice quality - looks just like the photo.","The fit is too small - I typically wear a 10-12 and the size 12 was skin tight.","Im 55 and the size 12 length fell just below my knee."
"wedding","The dress fit really well overall, but I would definitely say it runs large.","I usually wear a 4 or 6 depending on the size of the bust area, and if my twins werent so big, the 2 would have fit perfectly.","The tea length is perfect, and was great for the formal attire wedding."
"wedding","The dress fit great and was very comfortable."
"wedding","I found this dress to be the most comfortable RTR dress Ive rented so far.","Granted its very fitted and had more ruching than I thought but it hugs your body the right way.","Its thick but flexes with your body.","I am 56 about 128 lbs and the 6R fit me like a glove.","I just had a baby so the 4R may have fit me in my pre-baby body.","I wore a strapless bra but you dont need one.","In certain lighting the dress can come off with a hint of green but up close the gold shimmer is really pretty."
"wedding","The dress was comfortable.","It was elegant and also sexy with the lace cut out.","First time renting but definitely not my last."
"wedding","I rented the 2 and the 4 but when I tried on the size 4 I noticed that there was something that looked like a post-it showing through the lining at the bottom of the dress.","When I lifted up the lace I saw that the lining had been torn and then repaired but they had sewed in a different colored patch on the front of the lining.","It was noticeable (to me) through the lace and so I called Rent the Runway right away because the 4 fit me better, the size 2 was a little tight in the arms.","They were able to make it right by sending me another black lace dress in 2 sizes since they didnt have a size 4 in this dress but even though it was a beautiful dress I went with the size 2 in this dress because I just loved the color so much.","I received so many compliments on this dress throughout the night.","It really popped!","I will say sitting in the Uber on the way to the wedding the dress is pretty short when you sit down so keep that in mind.","Thank you to Rent the Runway for trying to make things right with my original rental.","They have such awesome customer service!"
"wedding","Absolutely loved this dress!","I felt like the most beautiful person there and did not want to return this dress!","I am 58 and chose to wear the 6L.","For me, it was more comfortable around the chest and stomach area.","The 4L was extremely tight in those areas for me.","I wore 4.5 inch heels and probably couldve afforded to wear an inch higher in heels.","The dress dragged the ground a little and my heel did get stuck in the hem a number of times.","Other than that, I couldnt have asked for a better dress!","Extremely comfortable and I still managed to dance the night away and enjoy myself.","Received countless compliments!","Would recommend to anyone that asked!",":)"
"wedding","Im usually an 8/10, but only the 10L and 12R were available, so thats what I went with.","The 12 was too big up top (lots of extra fabric) and the 10 fit really well, but the 10 was unavailable in Regular and the Long was just a bit too long for flats (the wedding was on the beach and no way was I wearing heels).","Some safety pins and fashion tape fixed up the top, though, and I was good to go!","The dress is wonderfully flowy and the slit up the left leg provides a really nice detail to an otherwise standard long dress.","The colors were fantastic, it did not show sweat (very important for someone like me who tears up the dance floor and gets a workout in when Twist and shout comes on at weddings).","and I felt just as comfortable sitting as I did standing in it.","The zipper gets stuck on the back, no matter if the dress is on OR off, so dont let that freak you out when you first try to zip it up!","I would definitely rent this again for future events."
"wedding","For a petite it is pretty long.","I am 54 and 120 pounds and the 2P was perfect!","There is a train for the dress so beware.","I wore 3.5 inch heels and it was fine.","Everyone loved my dress and I received so many compliments.","A great color and dress to stand out in at a wedding.","The material is thick so it truly feels like you are wearing a gown.","I would rent this dress again and again.","Wish I could keep it!"
"wedding","This was a beautiful dress worn to a formal wedding.","I received so many compliments throughout the night!","Be prepared to wear tall heels as it does run very long."
"wedding","I wore this to an outdoor wedding in June.","I loved that I was able to wear wedge heals.","Note that it is quite long- Im 55 and had to wear 3 1/2 wedges to get enough height not to drag on the floor.","It was also a bit large through the bodice and required a stick on bra (or a bra you can see on the back as it is too low cut for a regular bra) I opted for a t-back black bra with back straps that were meant to be seen.","It was pretty cold at the wedding so I had a jacket on most of the night anyway."
"wedding","This dress has a very pretty pattern and a great flow with the fabric in the skirt.","That said, I didnt/couldnt wear this dress.","It was so long and there was so much fabric, I would have either been tripping or carrying my dress all night.","Im 55 for reference.","Went with another option."
"wedding","This dress was beautiful.","It fit like a glove and was very comfortable.","The stretchy material helped it to fit in all the right places.","The rouching added a nice texture to the dress.","The length was perfect with a 3 inch heel.","I received many compliments the night of the event.","The material is quite thick so I wouldnt recommend for an outdoor event in the heat, but it was totally fine during my indoor event.","The material helped to cover up any lumps and bumps, since it was thick.","The only issue I had was that I wasnt comfortable with the gap in the front.","I ended up pinning it shut because I felt like my boobs were too exposed.","Other than that, it was a beautiful dress.","This is my second RTR experience and I will definitely use it again."
"wedding","This dress is lighter weight than I thought it would be, for a more casual feel than Id expected.","It fit with the mason jar and burlap motif of my friends wedding, though.","Fabric is stretchy, too, so it moved well with me on the dance floor.","Size 4 fit just right, though would be tight on a bustier woman (34B with broad shoulders here).","Length, too, was perfectly at the knee on my 58 frame."
"wedding","This was my back up dress; however, I was happy to wear it!","I normally wear between a size 6 and 8 (I have large hips and a small chest) I ended up wearing the 6 and it was a little too big at the top but perfect on the waist.","I had to safety pin the back together to keep a tight fit so I wouldnt have any nip slips (but even then I found myself looking to see if anything had fallen out.)","I wore 3 inch wedges and the dress still caused me to trip a couple of times.","Other than that, it was a beautiful dress that definitely stood out and the pictures dont do it justice."
"wedding","Like other reviewers, my true to size dress was tight in the bust.","However, the size up still looked great and allowed me to indulge at the wedding!","The gold flecks and uneven hemline made this dress interesting, and even though the fabric felt more late fall/winter, I received a lot of compliments wearing this in the spring."
"wedding","i received a lot of compliments on this dress, though I didnt find it particularly flattering.","I was also bummed that it barely touched the floor when I was barefoot (Im 510 and ordered the long).","It was definitely too short once I put on the heels but i didnt have anything else to wear for the wedding.","Again, everyone thought it was pretty and once I took off my shoes (they started hurting), I didnt feel so self conscious that it was too short."
"wedding","The dress has no give to it and you have to pull it over your head.","The underneath of the dress kept riding up in the front so I had to continue pulling it down while dancing."
"wedding","The dress looked great and was comfortable, not snug or too tight in the bodice.","However, it was a bit short, making it difficult to sit and dance at times."
"wedding","Fit great, but the top was a little tight.","The back is low, but you can wear a normal bra.","And it has pockets!","Got so many compliments on the dress"
"wedding","First of all, the dress looks great and the color went great with my skin tone!","However, there were some functional issues with the dress.","I ended up wearing the 6R because I felt the 4R was a little short with heels on, but because of the bigger size, the neckline was much lower than it should have been.","I ended up having to fasten the whole upper half of the dress with fashion tape to get it in the right place, which was fine, but definitely at lot more work than your average dress.","Also, I dont know if this was just me, but the clasps for the top of the dress were incredibly difficult to get on/off, which just made getting in and out of the dress more difficult.","Overall, while I love the look and comfort of this dress, you could possibly find something thats a little less work to put on/of and not require you to purchase fashion tape!"
"wedding","Was a tad big in the boobs and the waist but fit perfect in my butt and hips.","Im usally a size 18 but went for a 20 to be safe and it was a good fit!","Boobs looked nice and they were on display lol."
"wedding","- Wore to an outdoor, summer wedding in the Hamptons 2016- Waist is a little tight, wore my larger backup size- Very comfortable, danced all night- Lots of compliments, dress photographs well- Danced all night in this dress- Pockets are nice- Wore strappy sandals with 4 block heel (no stilettos to sink into grass)"
"wedding","So I rented this for a black tie wedding!","It was perfect.","I wore the 4R and with a 3 inch heel it was the perfect length.","It was a little snug in my belly( my fault, not the dresses lol) but fit perfect up top; no arm/boob gap!","The 6 was loser in my belly but just too big up top!","The only con for me was My heel would snag the lace at the back of the dress when I would stand up or go up/down stairs but after the first few times I knew to just pull the dress up at those moments."
"wedding","I LOVED this dress!","The colors are perfect for a spring/summer wedding!","I wore a 4L but could only wear 3 inch heels, nothing taller with the length (Im 58).","So if you are tall, get the long for sure.","The only issue with it is that the clasp at the neck would frequently come undone, especially while sitting.","It would be better if they had used a button instead of a hook clasp there.","But I still loved wearing the dress and got so many compliments all night long.","I was originally worried that it would be too tight on the skirt portion, but the skirt is more of an A line, so it works well with any body type.","I wish I could wear it again!"
"wedding","Easy dress to wear, comfortable but still sexy.","I got a million compliments and I felt fabulous in it."
"wedding","The fit was comfortable for whether sitting, standing or dancing.","I am 56 and the dress hit me right above the knee.","I was a perfect fit.","I will definitely rent this dress again.","I was sad I had to return it."
"wedding","Absolutely loved this dress.","Im 58 and was glad I ordered the long.","I loved the low back, but you definitely cant wear a bra.","Highly recommend this dress!","!"
"wedding","Ive rented this dress in 2 colors (cobalt and coral) - it is so comfortable and flattering!","I have a fairly athletic build and am short (52) and the dress suits my body type very well.","I wore a sticky bra with this, but any strapless bra would work well.","The material is heavy enough not to show any lines and the cut outs are so fun!"
"wedding","It fit like a glove!"
"wedding","This dress was very true to size.","Im typically a size 4 - it fit perfectly.","It showed a bit more of the chest area than I thought it would, but was still a very classy look!","The length was perfect and I loved how the skirt flared a little (to hide a lot of the stomach area).","I have small shoulders and often have trouble with the top part of dresses but this dress was perfect.","I wish I could buy it, I felt so beautiful and comfortable all night long!!","I would definitely rent it again, I received a lot of compliments."
"wedding","As a taller woman, I was looking for a dress that would be conservative AND fun for a fall wedding.","This was the perfect choice, as the length came in right at my knee, but the paneled top did a great job of showing a little skin.","I went with the 8 (my standard dress size) and the 10 for my backup.","The 8 fit nicely, but I wish I would have gone with the 6 for my back-up.","I still had to wear a strapless bra because the top wasnt tight enough without it (bust size is 36C).","But overall, awesome dress and great experience with RTR!"
"wedding","I absolutely loved this dress!","The fit was perfect and I got a lot of compliments in it!","The bottom of the dress hit right in between my knees and ankles.","It was a nice fit without being too tight.","The material is quality, not very stretchy.","It’s a thinker material which made for a great winter dress.","I wore this to a wedding on December 23rd and it was prefect!","It was comfortable to sit and dance in!","I felt there wasnt enough padding to go without a bra so I recommend the stick on strapless bras.","It does appear darker (more black) in photos.","Overall, this was my first time renting with RTR and I was extremely impressed.","I was sad to send this dress back I loved it so much!","I highly recommend this dress and can’t wait to rent another dress soon!"
"wedding","This dress was great - and the first time Ive had to use my second size.","I couldnt zip the four (which is my typical size) - the six was perfect.","Colors are stunning - flattering fit, and that hemline is to die for!"
"wedding","You must wear a flesh-colored lacey bra because of the see-through lace panels on sides and back.","It blended right in!"
"wedding","I had ordered this dress once before in a 14 and it didnt fit.","I usually wear between a 12 and 14.","The 16 fit but was very tight around he band.","Otherwise, it was extremely comfortable and flattering.","I got compliments all night.","I really loved the way the dress moved when I walked and danced.","I couldnt stop twirling in the dance floor!","Gorgeous!","!"
"wedding","This dress was beautiful.","I received many compliments all evening.","The dress fit like a glove.","Not sure what type of fabric it is but definitely holds you in, in all the right places."
"wedding","Im long in the torso so even though the 2 fit perfectly, I needed the 4R to fit comfortably in that respect."
"wedding","This was a really cute dress, and the cut outs made it comfortable for a hot summer wedding!","The fabric is all lace, which you cant tell from the picture.","It looked way better in person than in this picture.","It was a little longer than I was expecting, but Im short, so that happens often."
"wedding","Fit was true to size, the sequins do rub near the underarm area in the front and left red marks that lasted for a couple days.","Other than that I have no complaints at all with the dress."
"wedding","Paired with silver sling back peep toe jimmy choos and a white/silver shimmery shawl perfected it for me.","Wore with nude crossed/racerback bra straps."
"wedding","Sexy but sophisticated, warm, and fits all body types well."
"wedding","The color of this dress and pattern of the lace are gorgeous.","Im 57 with a larger bust and it fit well, and wasnt too long or short.","Wore a stick on bra since the back is open.","The one drawback to this dress is how short the lining is.","Be prepared for that, as I had to add a pair of shorter Spanx to ensure all was covered!","Would rent again."
"wedding","Looks exactly as pictured!","Simple, but elegant and beautiful.","Wore to a March wedding (6 months post-partum) which made the long sleeves perfect because it ended up being freezing!","With a statement necklace, this is amazing!"
"wedding","It fits true to size .","You definitely dont need a bra with this dress, and you cant wear high Spanx.","I just wore a cheeky undie, This is worth every penny !","I danced the night away and loved it !","I also got the style pass which was totally worth it !"
"wedding","The fit was true to size and the a-line cut was great for my body type.","The length was perfect and appropriate for my event."
"wedding","I ordered this dress as a replacement when my initial order got screwed up.","I ended up liking this better than the original dress I ordered anyways!","The color is so vibrant, and the sleeves were perfect since it ended up being a little chillier day.","Also, pockets!","Need I say more?","Only reason I say it runs a bit small is the sleeves can be a bit tight and the bust is a little tight.","Im usually an 8 or a 10 depending on how it fits across the bust.","The 10 ended up fitting better this time.","Loved the dress, got so many compliments, and shout out to RTRs awesome customer service for getting this to me in under 24 hours!","!"
"wedding","Loved this dress!","The color is beautiful!","Though this dress is tight, it hugs you at all the right places and gives you a sexy yet classy look and as a of mom of three I was going for just this!","Thanks to all the other reviewers I went with the size 6 and it fit like a glove!"
"wedding","I loved this dress, it was stunning, but the size seemed to run a little bit small, the dress dug into me a bit and it was super tight and uncomfortable.","Unfortunately with a 14 there was nowhere higher for me to go.","I usually dont experience this with dresses, especially size 14 so I would suggest going one size up if you order it."
"wedding","I usually wear a 6 but also ordered an 8, just in case.","The 8 turned out to be quite ambitious as it was too loose on me to bother with.","I bring up the size 8 dress anyway because the edges of the lace on the straps was pretty tattered... to the point where even if it had fit, theres no way I wouldve worn it anyway.","It looked really messy.","The 6 I ended up wearing was beautiful.","The zipper stuck in some spots, but not a big deal.","It was a little loose in the straps & on my waist, but I have fuller hips/thighs, so I couldnt have gone down a size anyway.","Regardless, I thought it looked great and got a few compliments!","It hugged my curves without being restricting, so I could have some fun on the dance floor.","The back is too low to wear a bra with, so I used those sticky ones that are just cups...","Probably couldve gone without a bra entirely with the built-in bodice, but because of the loose straps, I wanted to make sure I didnt have an incident if the straps slid off my shoulders!","The length was perfect as well, not too short and not too long!","The vibrant color was great for a spring/summer wedding.","Sidenote - this was my first RTR experience so I had a few questions and the customer service was awesome at responding super quickly!"
"wedding","Dress runs larger than I would have liked, but still looked great.","The material was thick and so it didnt wrinkle and was very comfortable to wear.","Great because you can wear a normal bra with it."
"wedding","So flattering.","An old dog could look good in this dress.","But I dont know how anyone can actually wear it.","The biggest issue is the straps, which are really weird.","They just kind of loop around your shoulders and into your armpit, theres nothing actually holding them up.","The second I slouched my shoulders or bent down to put on my shoes they were half way down my arms and the girls popped out.","Second issue is the the way the bodice is styled.","It hits the boobs in a weird spot so you have some quad-boob action.","I wasnt really sure what to do about it.","I coulda perked them up and over the trouble spot, but that was a little precarious, esp with the shoulder strap issue.","I figure the only way to really wear this dress is with a lot of tape.","I didnt have the guts."
"wedding","Fits pretty well.","Spanx kind of show through, so I didnt end up wearing them underneath.","The shoulder thing is a little restricting but manageable."
"wedding","This dress runs large.","Size down, size down, size down.","Typically a 4 in dresses but always worried about length I felt comfortable ordering this as a bridesmaids dress in which I knew I would be wearing 5 inch heels.","This puts me over 6 feet.","This dress was the perfect length with the heels.","Without, it was a mess and too long which is a luxury that I never have.","The 4 would have worked but the 2 fit like a glove and I knew I could move comfortably without worrying about dancing and the bridal party photos.","My dress needed a really good steaming after I received it before I could wear it."
"wedding","The dress was easy to wear and figure-flattering, making my waist appear tiny.","It did carry a little smell in the fabric in the armpit and had light wear, but I dont think anyone noticed.","The zipper was also a little worn and even though the dress was a perfect fit, it was difficult to zip up and down.","I got away with wearing flats to a wedding and at 54 the dress was not too long.","It would be okay with up to a 3-inch heel as well.","I received many compliments and enjoyed this rental."
"wedding","As someone who is self conscious about their arms but still wants to show off their shape, this was a perfect choice for me.","Its form fitting before it flares out a bit (mermaid style) and then has the cold shoulder aspect showing a little skin.","The fabric has a bit of give but also holds you in which is nice.","I loved the navy color as well.","I will definitely be renting again and highly recommend."
"wedding","This dress worked really well for me for a formal wedding.","The fabric looks structured, but it really isnt, so it is a perfect dress for people who really like to get into it on the dance floor (like me).","I ordered a medium and a large, and, as seems to be the case a lot for me, I really didnt see much difference between the two.","The dress is just overall very forgiving and easy to wear.","I skipped a bra, but a standard strapless one would have worked just fine (it goes up high enough on the back).","I was in the mood to be comfortable, although if I rented it again, I think I might try a bra to fill out the top a little.","I have broad shoulders and I felt like the shoulder strap broke them up perfectly and minimized them.","Ill look for more dresses like that.","My shoulders always look huge in regular strapless dresses."
"wedding","I am 52, 55, and weigh around 150 lb.","This dress is very stunning!","However, I recommend going a size up with your backup size.","The top area of the dress is very very tight.","There is a belt near the waist that I could not snap closed without it opening up.","I therefore had to tuck the belt in the pocket (it was hidden very well, being that the belt does not detach from the dress).","Other than that, I loved the dress!"
"wedding","Wore this 5 months pregnant for my brothers wedding.","Fit was loose and flowy.","Comfortable, but a bit big on my small frame.","Definitely size down.","Color is bright, but I liked it overall.","Wore with black tights and kitten heels for a winter wedding."
"wedding","The fit was very true to size.","Im pretty tall so I was happy they offered the size in Long.","Never rented a long dress from #RTR so happy to know it was long enough for my height."
"wedding","I was a little worried about the fit in the chest, so I went for the 8 and 10 and the 8 was perfect!","The length was good for me and my height for my friends day wedding.","We each found our own dress in the wedding party and this fit the bill perfectly!","I could eat, dance, drink and also not sweat my life away as the wedding was outside too!","All in all, great dress!","That Shoshanna knows how to cut a nice frock, yall."
"wedding","This dress looked great and was super comfortable--I got compliments on it all night.","I found that while it fit well up top, the waist and bottom were quite large.","It was also just a little too long.","I generally wear an 8 in Shoshanna, but probably should have sized down to a 6 in this particular dress."
"wedding","Im usually a size 4 and this fit perfectly!","The color was a deep emerald green, I received lots of compliments, it was also very comfortable.","My only complaint was that the lining was longer than the hem so I had to run out & buy some fashion tape."
"wedding","Dress was perfect, you can dress it up or down!"
"wedding","The lace is constricting as others have noted, but not uncomfortable.","I could not lift my arms higher than shoulder height, definitely need another set of hands to zip up/unzip.","As the night went on it seemed to loosen up and I was comfortable the entire time.","Received so many compliments on the color and fit.","I recommend ordering a size up.","The best part-no bra necessary!"
"wedding","This dress is significantly more conservative in real life than it is in the photo.","They must have removed a layer of lace on the models dress to show that much skin in the chest and shoulder areas.","I almost didnt wear it because it seemed more appropriate for a funeral than a wedding.","That said, if you are going for conservative, you will probably love it."
"wedding","It fit true to size, was a little snug around the stomach area which I didnt love, but I think the type of fabric made it that way.","It was also hard to sit in the dress, as it rode up a lot.","It was classy and elegant though, and I definitely recommend it for a summer wedding."
"wedding","The MR fit me well, except the sides of my chest puckered like mentioned in some other reviews.","It was really unflattering.","Other than that, the dress fit well.","The pink is subtle and pretty.","I wore it with nude heels but changed into flats for dancing, as pictured."
"wedding","I loved this dress the moment I saw it and knew it would be perfect for one of the weddings I was attending this year.","I normally wear a 6.","The 6 fit perfect on top, but was way to tight and short on the bottom so I wore the 8.","The top part of the 8 was a little too big and there was a semi-awkward gap around my armpit where the sleeve.","In the photo I posted you can see the gap.","I also had to keep pulling my shoulders up since it was too big.","BUT my friends said it wasnt noticeable so I wasnt too self-conscious about it.","I was also a little nervous to not wear a bra (I didnt want to buy on of the backless gel bras that I would never wear again), but the way the dress fit I was totally OK not wearing one.","Im a 34C and had no issues.","Overall I got a lot of compliments from strangers and it was a hit despite the slightly awkward fit."
"wedding","This dress was a last minute backup when (the day before the wedding) my original RTR dress was never shipped.","Fortunately, customer service was helpful and worked with me to find a different dress at the last minute and shipped it overnight to me.","I wore this dress for my best friends 20s themed wedding.","It fit like a glove, was super comfortable and I was still the best dressed one in the wedding party despite this being my second choice."
"wedding","I am 57 105lbs and could have worn the XS or the S, but the S was just a tad loose around my waist.","I got so  many compliments on this dress, I will definitely rent it again!","It has a mauve undertones, its not exactly powder pink like the picture suggests.","I can almost never find long sleeves that go all the way to my wrists due to my long arms and these sleeves were more than long enough."
"wedding","I wore this dress to a vintage themed wedding and had a lot of fun wearing it!","I am between a 6 and in 8 for a regular size and I ended up wearing the 6 in this one it fit perfectly and was very flattering and comfortable.","I would recommend considering sizing up if you are taller or want a little extra length though because it is pretty short."
"wedding","So comfortable, great color, true to size, no complaints!","Didnt want to return."
"wedding","This dress surpassed my expectations.","It was stretchy and therefore incredibly comfortable.","The length and hug of the dress were appropriate for a wedding.","The lace detail was so well placed and interesting it caught a lot of attention.","Another plus was that the lace allowed for me to wear a normal beige bra.","I was glad I read the reviews carefully as I would normally order sizes 2 & 4 but for this dress, I ordered the 0 & 2 and wore the 0.","I loved it and would consider renting it again."
"wedding","A little loose up top vs. the bottom but very flattering and received many compliments"
"wedding","standard shift cut, on the shorter side, has a slip underneath with strap hooks to keep it secure,"
"wedding","Perfect fit!!!...","delivery on time....easy to return....."
"wedding","Pros: Length; Color; Fabric was breathable.","Cons: ZIPPER WAS AWFUL"
"wedding","Ordered this dress as my back-up dress for a wedding and ended up wearing it for the rehearsal dinner.","Ordered the 4r with the worry the 6 would be too big but also that the 4 might be too small based on the reviews.","The 4r fit perfectly, lots of room in the stomach/hip area.","The top was a bit snug.","Not in the boob area but where the armpits are and also the neck line but nothing I could not handle for an evening.","I did not need to wear a bra, it was comfortable without it.","I wore about 2 1/2 inch heels and the length was perfect."
"wedding","I am a size 10 and RTR was out of the 12 for back up.","I was really nervous this dress would not fit me, since previous reviewers have said it runs small.","But it fit perfectly!","If you have a slim waist but carry your weight in your lower midsection I highhhhly recommend this dress, it is very slimming!","I am 510 with a long torso so the underskirt was bit short and the chest liked to ride up.","I had to be very conscious of my dress all night, in other words I could not partake in the YMCA.","But the dress made me stand out enough on its own!"
"wedding","This was my first experience with Rent the Runway.","I ordered this dress in a size 14 along with another dress (same designer) in  the same size.","I received the dressed on Friday for a Sunday wedding.","I tried this dress on, and it wouldnt zip to the top, but once it did, there was no room to breathe.","I didnt even try the next one on because my friend had already rented it.","I called RTR and I was assisted with another dress I had in mind, (same designer, size 16) It was overnighted to Saturday.","Besides having a faulty zipper, this dress was probably even more uncomfortable and wouldnt zip to the top.","So, I dont blame RTR, it just taught me to look into the designers size chart because they are not all the same!","Anyway, long story short, I ended up fitting into this dress and returned the other two.","It was tight, but I still got a lot of compliments.","Thanks RTR!"
"wedding","This dress is very flattering and I received compliments all night long.","The color is gorgeous.","Like the pictures show, the cutout is revealing if you have a large bust (as I do), so it may not be the right dress for you if you are self conscious in that area.","The waist was fitted, but actually a little bit loose on me.","Overall, would definitely rent this dress again - beautiful, fun, and unique!"
"wedding","This dress was perfect for a summer wedding!","LOVED the pockets and cutouts."
"wedding","Absolutely gorgeous in every way!"
"wedding","This was perfect for a summer black tie wedding - it felt formal without being stuffy.","I loved the color and off the shoulder style.","It was definitely a bit sexier and tighter than what I usually go for, but was fun to wear for one night!","It definitely runs small and is super fitted through the hips, but the 0 fit better in the chest and shoulders than the 2, so I decided to go for it"
"wedding","The dress was perfect for the black tie optional wedding I went to.","I paired it with red beaded earrings and 3 inch black sandals and got lots of compliments all night.","Its a little snug on the ribs but fit perfectly everywhere else, definitely gives you a nice booty!","Highly recommend!"
"wedding","I usually wear a 4, but only a 2 was available.","It was a tight squeeze (especially in the chest), but I was determined to make it work!","This dress was absolutely stunning and Im so glad I was able to wear it."
"wedding","The dress fit well, though I should have rented a size down (they were sold out).","I think the 8L worked well, but the straps were way too long on me.","I had to wear a bra underneath, which I only needed because the straps created a lot of extra space by my chest.","The length was perfect with heels, and it is a very comfortable dress for dancing.","If the straps were shorter or I was able to alter the length a bit, it would be five stars."
"wedding","Felt really pretty in this dress.","Didnt think red was my color but got lots of complements!","Will definitely rent again!"
"wedding","This was my first experience with RTR.","I wore this dress to a black tie optional wedding, and loved it.","I normally wear a size 8 or 10 in dresses, but decided to size up after reading the reviews.","Im glad I did, because although both sizes fit, my chest was spilling out of the 10L in a way I didnt especially like (Im a 38C so Im busty, but not overly so).","The longer length was definitely necessary for me.","I wore 3-inch heels and they worked well, though I found myself consciously trying to avoid stepping on the lace hem from time to time.","The dress was lighter and more comfortable than I expected it to be.","It hugged every curve, but was very breathable/movable.","I felt beautiful in it, got tons of compliments, and honestly didnt want to send it back!","I think I will more than likely be renting it again at some point."
"wedding","It gaped a bit at the bust, but Im pretty small... on someone more well endowed than me it would likely fit better, but expose more chest area.","I just pinned it and it didnt bother me all night.","Im 57 and the R length was perfect in flats.","If I wanted to wear heels I would have probably needed the Tall."
"wedding","I got tons of compliments on this dress!","It is slightly awkward to find a bra to wear with it, so I didnt end up wearing one, but it was ok because it is rather fitted in the bust.","The fabric was a lot nicer than I expected."
"wedding","Slit is higher than I expected.","Wear your hair up, bc the front is stunning!"
"wedding","This was my back-up dress for a wedding.","It fit perfectly and is beautifully made.","I thought it made me look a little matronly.","Better for a younger person.","I am over fifty, perfect size 6, 53, 120 lbs; 34DD."
"wedding","This dress is beautiful - the colors are more vibrant in person than they appear online and its just a comfortable, flattering, beautiful dress and was perfect for a wedding in FL.","I would absolutely rent it again.","The length is on the shorter side, so if I had the option, I would have gone with the long to allow me to wear a higher heel.","If you are tall, you will definitely need a short heel for the regular size."
"wedding","I loved the fit of this dress.","The fake crop top was fun, and the skirt was beautiful.","It had great movement on the dance floor!","I wouldnt say its a wow dress, but my husband loves to surf, so it was his favorite dress Ive rented.","I am 53 130 lbs 34C and the 4P was a little tight up top, but the perfect length in 3 heels.","I have a wide rib cage, so it probably would be perfect on most my size.","My backup was the 6R and it was just too long, so I went with the 4P.","My biggest issue was that the dress was pretty worn, fraying on the hem of the crop and some pulls in the print."
"wedding","I wasnt sure about the dress when I tried it on the first night.","My boyfriend insisted it was great.","But once I got to the venue (his sisters wedding - in a gorgeous Art Deco building), I got nothing but compliments all night about how gorgeous this dress was.","Be aware, the lace has zero give - so this fits like a glove and is a little constricting on arm movements over your head (dont plan on climbing monkey bars or anything).","Also, the dress is very heavy, and despite having rather wide lace on the shoulders, is fairly warm.","I cannot say enough good things about this gorgeous dress.","As other reviewers said, the pictures absolutely dont do it justice.","Stunning."
"wedding","Actually ended up wearing my back up size (size 0).","I never even tried on the size 2 so I cannot compare."
"wedding","Loved this dress!","The fit is true to size.","I am usually an 8, I got a 8R and the cut was perfect.","The slit was in a great position which allowed for dancing all night long!","I found a bit of difficulty placing the peek-a-boo cut on the strap correctly on my chest, but any way I put it, looked great."
"wedding","This dress overall was great!","I really needed to wear a size 4, but it was all rented.","I received both the 2 & 6 and the 6 was way too big.","The size 2 fit, but it was snug.","Even with the snug fit the straps were way too big, but that is mostly because I am only 51.","I got tons of compliments and cant wait to rent from RTR again, it is always a pleasure!"
"wedding","The dress fit true to size.","The inner part was a little short but because of the front and back overlay, it was perfectly classy.","It was a little different in style, but fit my style well."
"wedding","I wore the 8L, Im 5-10 (135lb).","It fit great, but was a little loose in the bust which caused the back straps to pucker slightly--really not a big deal (I also had the 6L, which was too tight).","A backless-strapless bra filled out the bust and was perfect for the big day.","The material of the dress is very structured and hangs beautifully.","The pockets came in handy, and because of the shape and fabric, it was not obvious I had things in the pockets."
"wedding","I wore this to my sister in laws wedding and I loved it!","I felt great and the color was unique.","Its a dress that stands out without trying too hard.","I got text messages from people who werent at the wedding who saw pictures on facebook telling me they loved my dress."
"wedding","I wore this dress to my brothers wedding in St. Paul, Minnesota for a fall wedding.","It was perfect!","The material is thick and shiny, very durable.","I chose to go with a sticky backless bra.","The back adds just the perfect touch of sass to an otherwise very modest cut.","The skirt is a bit fuller than I was expected but it hit at the perfect length.","Im usually a 0.","I tried it on and it fit like a glove, did not even try on the 2.","You wont be disappointed!","Great dress!"
"wedding","Paired with a simple pair of champagne loubies and a simple crystal lieber, super comfy.","No bra really was needed.","Everything was in place and stayed put running after 3 little boys that were ushers and ring boy.","Had hair in a simple updo to show the dress off completely.","Dress had a little give to hug in all the right spots like most Herves do.","Perfect for a date night or wedding.","Absolutely stunning!"
"work","This dress was amazing for work!","I am an attorney and generally dress very conservatively, yet this dress was perfect for a long day in court and even judge-ready with a blazer.","The classic and conservative fit balances out the bold pattern making this an excellent choice for work.","The tailoring was perfect, comfortable but cinched just enough at the waist to still look polished and put together."
"work","Shorter than I expected, but worked okay with black tights for work."
"work","This is a great casual shirt dress for casual Fridays that you can dress up a bit with heels or stacked sandals and it looks equally as cute with white sneakers or Converse.","I just wasnt in love with it but it was very comfortable and had pockets which is one detail that I did love."
"work","Fit me perfectly (im normally between a size 4 & 6, and rented the 6)."
"work","I loved the fit of this dress.","It was so comfortable that after my work event, I paired it with some white sneakers and kept it on while we went out afterwards.","A very easy dress to transition.","The skirt is a little longer than I thought, which is actually great, because it made it more work appropriate."
"work","This dress was so adorable.","The fit is very relaxed, plenty of hip room for us pear girls.","This dress is a satin/silk material so if you are planning on wearing it for a night out I would advise against it.","It shows every bit of water/condensation splashed on it."
"work","I loved this dress!","The material is thick and of a very good quality.","I had to return it though, because I couldnt walk in it.","It is very, very fitted all throughout and on someone as petite as me, the hem fell so far below the knees that it was difficult to adequately walk in.","I am hoping to get it on my next Unlimited order in a SM which will hopefully have a bit more room for walking.","Other than that, if you are renting it for an event where movement will be minimal, it will fit you perfectly!"
"work","This is one of my favorite RTR.","The pattern is so lovely, and the colors are vibrant.","I would have worn this dress for a whole week if it was acceptable to.","Will likely rent again, and purchase.","I love shift dresses!"
"work","I am quite small and struggle to find clothes that fit well, and this actually fit me.","It was such a relief.","Plus there are pockets!","I got a bunch of compliments and I felt comfortable and confident."
"work","This dress is so beautiful!","I think it could easily be worn to work, on a casual day out or even out at night and dressed up with heels.","I wore it to work with wedges and it was SO comfortable.","The waist is elastic which gives extra comfort.","I think I may keep this around to wear again on an upcoming trip with some flats."
"work","This Tory Burch dress is so fun.","Originally I thought it was polka dots but its actually tiny fish.","The fit of the dress is incredibly flattering and very slimming.","The only con with this dress (as the other reviews point out) the chest area is really tight.","So if you are bigger in the chest area plan on wearing a camisole or something underneath.","Other than that it was great!"
"work","This was kind of long for me at 53."
"work","This is such a great dress but definitely get a size or two bigger.","Im usually a 2, wore a 4 and probably would have been fine in the 6."
"work","I really enjoyed wearing this dress, although it isnt as flattering as some of the pieces Ive gotten from RTR.","It was nice sweater-like (but lightweight) fabric and moved easily.","Nice everyday dress, but nothing too special."
"work","I loved the fabric and the overall look of this dress but it was not very enjoyable to wear.","It felt close to true to size but I have a wide ribcage and without ANY give in the fabric, it was constricting.","It created a nice shape and the color and iridescence was gorgeous but I couldnt wait to take it off.","Might have been easier in another size up"
"work","A little more interesting than your average LBD.","The texture stripes are subtle.","There is lots of rooms in the hip and booty area and the slightly high waist line makes a great hourglass shape!"
"work","Runs large and is very drapey.","Best styled with a slim fit pant/leggings"
"work","Rented this for a few interviews with my unlimited subscription and was so happy I did.","Its a perfect shade of blue, incredibly comfortable and flattering and has great subtle details.","True to size."
"work","It was perfect.","I got several compliments on this.","The fit is true to size and it really looks great on.","There is nothing I would change about it"
"work","Got this dress for a work conference in the springtime.","Fit true to size, although the shoulder area was a little big for me.","Most annoying part was that the lining peaked out of the neckline.","Overall the dress is structured, well made and flattering."
"work","Lightweight casual cotton fabric, fun for summer."
"work","This is a super soft cotton sweater dress.","Really comfortable and it held it shape all day which is a concern for me with this type of material.","It was a great weight for the cold weather here.","I did wear it for drinks after work and got a little warm but, the dress is so comfortable it didnt matter.","The dressy buttons set it apart from just a plain black dress.","The ruffle in the front is also a cute touch but, one side flopped over a lot.","I actually stapled it into place (fashion tape wouldnt stick) and you couldnt see the staple because of how it folded.","I would probably rent this again.","Great for a winter day or night, I wore with tights."
"work","The material is heavy and feels expensive, the draping was perfect.","I am busty so I like anything that minimizes.","This jumpsuit is amazing - got tons of compliments.","Certainly would love to own this one!"
"work","This is a very flattering dress.","The material is very heavy.","It is good for spring being it is sleeveless and somewhat short, despite the heaviness of the fabric."
"work","I rented this dress to wear to work with a solid black tights.","The slit on the thigh may be a bit high for work without tights.","The only problem I had was the second layer of fabric sometimes stuck to my tights scrunching the top layer of blue."
"work","I liked this overall, but not in love.","Still, really cool to try the cape look.","It true to size for a 14 with a little room to spare - the material didnt strike me as especially high quality looking, and it came too rumpled to wear to work without (ideally professional, but instead in my home) pressing.","Something about the material seemed a little cheap to me.","Also, this is a one button blazer, which I forgot to note -- on large chested peeps one button tends to gap open (I already know this) and so I usually avoid this look.","This was OK but I should have noticed before renting.","Overall due to the fabric, the rumpledness, and overall unflattering fit (on me, fine for others) because of the one button -- not the highly polished super chic look I was going for, but fine for everyday at work, and fun to wear the cape.","Got lots of cape compliments!"
"work","Loved the look of this jacket and the fabric didnt disappoint, nice weight for Spring and Fall.","I wore it with dark skinny jeans and a dark grey blouse underneath."
"work","I received a lot of compliments wearing the dress.","It is very comfortable and the cut is flattering."
"work","This was loose enough at the waist with enough stretch to be very comfortable for a mid-2nd trimester baby bump (without feeling like I was stretching it out or struggling with the zipper and without sizing up).","It was perfect to pair with a blazer for a client meeting, though I felt comfortable in it with the shoulders exposed at my law firm.","My only compliant is that the zipper material runs really far down the back, so it stuck out funny on my bum in a not very flattering way."
"work","This was absolutely beautiful!","Very very soft, and such a pretty color.","I am curvy and I did not like the one line of material along the top, it made me look curvier, but other than that this was absolutely stunning!"
"work","Fabulous dress and quality!","Fit almost like a shift, but had shape in the waist.","Plenty of space to move in and the colors are perfect for fall/winter and spring transition.","The fabric was light and flowy."
"work","The dress has a flattering fit.","The lining fits to your frame, leaving the drape of the outer fabric very flattering.","The fabric has a nice weight.","It would wear will year-round, when paired with the right accessories."
"work","Loved the neckline, but tight fitting if you carry weight in your hips.","I chose the larger of my two usual sizes and needed one size up still."
"work","This item was shorter than I anticipated (Im a tall lady) and a bit baggy looking.","Not very flattering.","Pros, it was comfortable, soft and nice pattern.","I did not end up wearing it."
"work","The dress is very low cut so I wore a bandeau under to prevent cleavage.","Its comfortable, sexy, and long enough to still be professional.","I received many compliments and would recommend it!"
"work","This is a classic DVF wrap dress except it is heavy sweater material.","Somehow I missed that in the description.","Way too heavy for Miami, so I never even wore it"
"work","I really enjoyed wearing this on a cool October evening to the restaurant I work at.","It was fun, easy to move around in and the pattern was a head turner.","I did not find the length too long at all as some have reported.","It was right at mid thigh on my 54 frame.","I love this designer for the fun little details he puts in his garments!"
"work","I received so many compliments on this dress.","The size 2 fit great, but I probably would have also been okay with the zero.","Great dress for the hot summer months at work."
"work","I really liked this dress!","It is very classy and the details make it feel expensive and high-quality.","It is heavy fabric and lined, so it was comfortable on a cooler day.","It is about as short as I feel comfortable going for work (mid-thigh) and rode up a bit when sitting, but still very professional.","Fit a little loose in the chest, but I am small-busted.","Would be perfect for a more evenly proportioned hourglass figure."
"work","Fits well.","I tend to have issues with jumpsuits being too short in the torso.","No such issue with this one."
"work","This dress has nice movement.","Its classy with a modern edge.","I wore it for a dinner/dance event during a work conference.","Size down -- I wore a small, and I NEVER wear small!","(Usually medium or large.)"
"work","Very comfortable dress for a work conference.","Wore with a leather jacket during the day and then took the jacket off to make it a little dressier for dinner.","I would definitely get it again."
"work","Conservative enough that I could wear it to a work function, but still super cute.","Was tightest in waist, and poofed out in just the right place to be very slimming and hiding the gut!",":) Got many compliments on this outfit.","Definitely able to either wear it fancy or dress it down, depending on the occasion!","Also it had pockets, which is always a plus.","I really enjoyed this dress, and would definitely recommend it."
"work","It was really poufy around the stomach area and just looked really strange on me."
"work","Wore to evening work-related fundraising event and got tons of compliments.","LOVED the color, absolutely gorgeous.","Heavy weighted and beautiful lace.","Although the 8 was the best overall fit, I went with the 10 because the bodice/bust area was a little too tight on the 8 and cut into the back of my shoulders so if you are big busted go with the bigger size.","Hidden pockets were fantastic and mid-calf length was perfect...didnt have to wear stockings but didnt worry about my winter white legs.","Hated to send it back, would definitely consider renting again."
"work","A little short in the arms but its a beautiful jacket.","Go up a size."
"work","im usually btwn a 2 and a 4, but wear a 4 in elizabeth and james.","i opted for a 6 this time because i was wearing it to a meeting.","i can easy wear the 4, too, but just found the 6 to be more professional.","a regular bra can be worn with this, but i actually opted not to wear one.","im short at 53 so found the length to be perfect, just a couple of inches above the knee.","the cut is really great and figure flattering.","i wore it with nude heels in the office and will be changing into silver strappy sandals for a cocktail party after work.","this dress is such a great staple dress i may need to purchase it"
"work","I loved this blouse.","I rented using my Unlimited subscription and wore it to work with skinny ankle denim and heels for a casual Friday at the office-- then to meet up with friends for happy hour--super crisp white, remember to pack a liner as the blouse is a bit see through.","Next time I rent I will wear it with a black pencil skirt and statement heels.","will work for a cold day in NYC or anytime into the summer."
"work","Very constricting and not flattering on a short torso"
"work","Nice fabric.","Cute style."
"work","I am usually a size 2 but the 36 was a little bit too tight.","For French sizing, I would recommend going one size up.","The 38 fit perfectly.","The print on this dress is absolutely fabulous.","There are hidden scrubber divers and submarines in the busy design that can go almost without any notice.","I love that!","Very comfortable dress.","Beautifully made."
"work","mega cute, good with any cute pants for work or play.","runs suuuper big, so def size down.",":)"
"work","One of my favorite rentals!","Perfect for work, after-work and parties.","Wore it with jeans, work pants and a slim skirt.","Comfortable and slimming style.","If youre doing a presentation, the sleeves are fantastic for calling attention to gestures.","Downside of those dramatic sleeves is they can also get in the way - wore to a family party and was impossible to help with food prep."
"work","I love how this shirt and camisole fit -- It is a perfect frame for collarbones and décolleté.","Its powerful and feminine at the same time.","the hemline lacy edge is lovely and dresses up the look in a little extra mile kind of way.","It is the perfect creamy white for Fall/Winter.","Id caution anyone with a large bustline - this is meant to drape delicately.","The proportions would be totally different even in a push-up bra.","I think that would have ruined the aesthetic on the blouse for me as a natural 36C."
"work","Dress is a little large, hem had come out of the piece I had but I wore it anyway.","It is on the longer side - making it perfect for work."
"work","Loved this and the colors.","Got compliments all day at the office."
"work","I usually wear a 4, but got a 2 for this because it runs large.","and the 2 fit me perfectly.","I love how the dress flares out at the bottom and has pockets.","Its a very comfortable dress, and I got a lot of compliments on it."
"work","LOVELY dress.","The color and cut make this a real stand out.","Its perfect for a business elegant event... except that its a little more form fitting than it appears in the photos.","It doesnt have any stretch, and its not really a sheath as shown.","Rather, its curve hugging in the extreme.","Although the 8 (44) fit true to size, I decided it was a little too close for comfort for a professional event.","Im planning to rent again and size up for my next event with the hope that it will be more professional appropriate."
"work","The dress fit was true to size.","I wore this to work, but could easily wear it to an after work function or a party.","Im 55 and this dress was about 4 inches above the top of my knee.","Depending how conservative you want to be at work, this dress might be too short.","It was beautiful and light weight material.","Perfect for summer!"
"work","Fun pattern ads a bit of charm to a work outfit or weekend wear.","Paired it with jeans and a blazer.","I have broader shoulders/larger arms and this didnt pull which can be a challenge with shirts.","Not too boxy."
"work","Worn with navy opaque tights, very detailed navy flats, and a navy blazer this was perfect for work.","It WOULD of been my favorite look yet, but it rides up.","Order a size up!"
"work","I am tall and big chested, and the shirt was long enough and roomy enough.","Very slightly tight across the chest, but didnt pull or have any lines across from being too tight.","Wore with black leggings and my bandeau style scarf got lots of compliments!"
"work","This is a longer jacket.","I read on the reviews it ran big and wanted a more fitted look so I went with the 2.","It was very cute on.","It was light enough that I didnt get hot in it in the warm weather.","I would definitely wear again."
"work","The dress itself is definitely roomy - I probably couldve been happier in the M but the slip underneath is a bit weird.","It is separate from the actual dress but the chest part of the slip was way too snug for the large size.","Maybe it was the incorrect slip for that dress size, but it fit in the waist and hips just not the chest (Im a 36C so it shouldnt have been an issue).","I ended up wearing my own nude slip underneath and it was perfect for work."
"work","Love the casual fit and asymmetrical pleat.","Love the coloring for warmer weather.","Overall, comfortable and different."
"work","I generally wear a size 10 and the large fit well even a tiny bit generous.","Beautiful color, different but not at all fussy I liked it so much I would consider buying it."
"work","."
"work","I definitely liked this blazer, it was a little heavier than I expected but looked great.","My only real issue was the sleeves were a tad short for my longer arms."
"work","These ran a little large and while I would return them for a Small I dont yet want them to leave my closet so I am wearing them as is, a little long and a little wide but OH!","so comfortable and BLACK.","Not ready to send them back yet."
"work","Was a bit tight in the chest"
"work","Was a gorgeous piece but I have a shorter torso and so the fabric bunched around my waist and I couldnt wear it..."
"work","So comfortable but not the most flattering.","I could wear this sweater all the time.","Great print.","Soft material.","One of my favorite items even though it is just a simple sweater.","I typically wear a M top but I sized down to a S and it fit perfectly."
"work","I was concerned that it might be too tight for a work diner but it wasnt and the length was appropriate.","Loved it!","!"
"work","Fit perfectly - its frilly, flouncy, girly, and comfortable.","I popped a navy blazer over it and felt like a fashion rockstar at work all day."
"work","Nice blouse.","Its mesh knit polyester with black camisole.","Camisole absolutely necessary because its see through."
"work","I love Kate spade dresses and own several of their color block dresses.","I had never worn one with this cut before.","Its very flattering, but could be a little tight if you have larger hips - it flares out below your butt.","While the very top of the dress looks white in the picture, its actually gray.","Still cute, but i thought it was going to be white.","I did end up keeping this to add to my collection!"
"work","The collar was too large - it looked a little 70s to me.","The wrap dress was cute - but I couldnt get passed the large collar."
"work","Great dress!","Lots of compliments.","Im 54 and 32C.","Fits true to size.","Pair it with a cute belt and could be dressed up or down."
"work","Adore Kate Spade, but shes always been a bit on the small side for me.","This dress is adorable and completely work appropriate.","I havent been getting to the gym as much, so I felt more comfortable in Spanx, but you dont necessarily need them.","While the top of the dress is form fitting the bottom of the dress balances that all out.","The black section gives you a nice nip in at the waist!"
"work","Hides any flaws - will for sure rent again!","!"
"work","I love the way it looks online but it was way too big -- sort of tent-like.","Even if it were a size smaller though, I feel like its just not a good shape for a petite person."
"work","Wanted to wear these to a work event but the 4 was too big in the waist.","I would definitely rent the smaller size for another event."
"work","I love this dress and would absolutely love to have it in my closet all the time.","It was great for multiple presentations and being in and out of my car all day long.","Overall, I highly recommend this dress!"
"work","Received a lot of compliments, but I felt it was a bit short for work.","Although it was perfect for the wine tasting event I went to after work."
"work","Fit well, but the pleats in front are a bit unflattering"
"work","I wore this dress for a luncheon I was co-chairing - felt really confident in it.","This is a power color that looks great on fair skinned women.","Comfortable, conservative but with a little edge from the zipper in the back.","Received many, many compliments!"
"work","This dress was so much fun and definitely got me noticed.","It does have shoulder pads and adds a little more size to your frame because of the pads and sequins, but I still loved it.","And the open back was super sassy and sexy!","I even managed to wear a bra that went low enough that it didnt show."
"work","I actually got a lot of compliments on this little jumpsuit - its an easy outfit to take a little fashion risk (at least  in DC...) without trying too hard, a nice work appropriate casual cool with the pockets and ankle length, and the material and cut keeps it from looking too much like pajamas.","However, its pretty low cut and has a tendency to come open at the chest (even with size B like me), so it needs to be pinned."
"work","I sized up and it looked perfect."
"work","This dress as all DVF wrap dresses are AMAZING!!!","This dress fit perfect and made these DD girls look very happy!",":) Although this dress fit amazing in a size 8 I will next time get a size 10 I have a bit too much in the front and back.","But this was a good pick, so cool and perfect for the weather."
"work","Cute scallop detail"
"work","I ADORE a cape, and this dress did not disappoint.","It was comfortable, incredibly flattering, and I received oodles of compliments when I wore it.","I will definitely rent again!"
"work","Nice is definitely the description for this dress.","I wore this for work, so thats not a bad thing!","It is light and perfect for warm spring and summer days.","It buttons down the front, so if you are on the busty side the buttons may strain.","I did like that there was a hook to keep the waist closed in addition to the button.","Many of the dresses from RTR get a wow out of my husband, but this one only elicited its nice and safe.","Considering I was wearing it to work nice and safe are fine descriptors in my opinion.","A better way to describe it would be well made and conservative!"
"work","AMAZING dress.","Ive gotten so many compliments when I wear it.","Can dress it up or down - I threw a blazer on it for work.","I took the other reviewers advice and ordered a 10 (generally an 8) since I do have some hip curves, and it fit perfectly.","Great advice, thanks all.","Being that I am 510, I loved the length of this dress, it was still able to be professional."
"work","I enjoyed using the lace under other pieces, the slip on its own, or both pieces together as intended.","I wore it several days on my unlimited membership.","That said, it never really excited me, like some of the other pieces on this site."
"work","I really loved this top.","It is a thick scuba-like material with a foam backing.","The shape is interesting and eye catching, but very boxy and large.","I wore the 44 (my usual size in Marni dresses) and it was really big.","I would size down next time.","It definitely needed to be paired with a slim bottom (I wore it with white pants and black pants) to balance it out.","I received several compliments and some quizzical looks, which is exactly what I like."
"work","FITS LIKE A GLOVE.","THIS DRESS WAS GREAT FOR THE EVENT AND GOT ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS.."
"work","it was a bit large but not so much that I am convinced that the next size down would fit."
"work","beautiful color, great fit"
"work","This is another unlimited dress that has grown on me over the day.","I did not like it with the belt so I wore it without it.","The material is thin but it is lined with cotton so it is light and airy, perfect for warm weather.","I would say because this is a thin, almost gauze like fabric, it is more appropriate fore a casual event like brunch or vacation.","I am very large chested and there was room to spare with the large.","I probably could have worn the medium.","I usually wear a 12.","Size down especially if you are not large chested."
"work","The dress is perfect for spring weather as it is a thick fabric, but still a short dress.","I wore this for work followed by a dinner in the city.","I would say it runs on the smaller (and short!)","side.","It was just long enough to wear to work, but it was definitely just on the edge of being too short.","The fabric has virtually no stretch, and I found it plenty roomy in the body but snug around the hips (it has pockets which also added to the snugness around the waist).","Since its a shift, and not fitted, I think I should have sized up to allow for a looser fit and longer length."
"work","Runs small - the 4 fit like a glove (I am usually a 2).","Worked great on an hourglass shape with the black ribbon emphasizing the waist.","I work a regular black bra."
"work","I am between a 2 and a 4 and based on prior reviews ordered a 4.","It is correct; it is smaller in the bust.","I hate wearing a shirtwaist with buttons that gap, and getting the 4 it didnt.","The shape of this dress gives you a good shape and the full skirt is forgiving.","Cuter in person than the picture."
"work","Fit was true to size, I am normally an 8, 36C/D and I dont think anyone larger than me could fit into the medium.","I probably could have upd a size but the top was comfortable and wasnt pulling anywhere so I went with it.","I received a ton of compliments, oohs, and ahhs.","Probably because its such a unique top.","It does look a little like a cape when you walk, and it was a windy day and I felt a bit like a super hero.","The fabric is lovely but wrinkles easily.","I had to steam it before wearing, but after that it was fine.","Would rent again."
"work","The picture doesnt do the fabric justice - theres both texture and a hint of sparkle in the fabric thats really unique.","The dress looks expensive, and fits great.","Its easy to get on, fits true to size with a little give as the fabric is knit.","Would be great for both work and events."
"work","So comfortable!","As other reviewers said, there are no zippers or buttons so it just pulls on.","The material is beyond comfortable for a long day of work - even transitioning to afterwork drinks.","Fit true to size.","I was worried about the v-neck, but it was very appropriate even for full chest.","Highly recommend!"
"work","This was a cute dress.","Nothing special, but fun for a summer work day.","Fit felt true to size."
"work","I loved this dress!","The material felt so light - perfect for a warm day.","I thought it was a touch long, but I think I could have also gone down a size, so its hard to know.","The print was lovely and perfect since I wore it on the day of the eclipse - so celestial!","Would definitely recommend for a no-stress, fun outfit!"
"work","This is a cute dress for work.","Thin material, so nice in the summertime.","The slip underneath is a bit short/tight, so kept riding up.","Overall, I liked this dress and was nice for work once in a while... but also was not crazily wishing I could own it or anything!"
"work","I rented this for work and while I didnt absolutely 100% fall in love with it, I received a ton of compliments.","I wore it with tights and booties since its still pretty cold out, but I think I would like it even better without tights.","Very cute for work."
"work","Runs quite large and was very heavy.","Maybe would suit someone tall."
"work","The dress is maybe a little on the tighter side but does run true to size - the problem is that there really should be a zipper!","Had a hard time taking on and off.","Wasnt the biggest fan of the back of the dress, but paired it with a cardigan and could wear to work."
"work","I just loved this dress.","it fit great, and it was so beautiful!","there is not one thing I did not like about this dress.","I would love to buy it and I just might!"
"work","I rented this jumpsuit for a one day trip to Miami from NJ at 6 month post-partum.","I was super shocked that I was able to wear an 8R when my normal pre-pregnancy size was closer to 10!","The fit was great and very comfortable.","The pants are well-lined (I did not need spanx) and did not wrinkle during my travels.","Thank you RTR, for making this new mama feel so great!"
"work","I rented this dress for a semi-formal work event.","It has been very difficult to find dresses that will fit my post-baby #2 body.","This dress made me feel fabulous.","I was able to wear a regular bra which was great (I just lowered the straps a bit as recommended).","I loved the full skirt as it hid everything I wanted to hide.","And it has pockets!","The sequins were a bit scratchy under the arms but it would not deter me from wearing this dress again.","Overall, it was a fun dress and I felt really beautiful."
"work","The fit was pretty nice.","I think it ran a little small, and I wish I had ordered the large as a back up.","I wore shapewear underneath and looked great though.","This is a little shorter than what I typically wear, but it was still work appropriate."
"work","This shirt is floral.","It is floofy.","It is flouncy.","It is ruffled on the bottom.","It is ruffled at the cuffs.","It is ruffled along the raglan seams.","It is ruffled along the random seams halfway down the arms.","It has a whole row of floral, fabric-covered buttons down the front and a bow at the neck.","This shirt should be on the cover of a romance novel, being seductively slipped off the shoulders of a lady whos about to get it on with a shirtless pirate.","It wasnt my cup of tea, and I thought it made me look wide across the tummy, but I wore it to work and got three compliments from strangers in the elevator and the hallway.","Then I wore it out to a four-course dinner, and the generous room at the tummy came in handy!","So.... four stars?"
"work","I rented this for work and I didnt like it enough to wear it.","It made me look like I was wearing my moms school or church dress."
"work","Loved the bright colors, just ran too big for my frame so I didnt end up wearing it,"
"work","Loved this jacket, but it is a very shrunken fit.","I wore it with a lose black tee so it didnt look as cropped.","Would suggest sizing up for anyone who is a bit bustier or taller.","It was great quality and very very comfortable, the material was cotton rather than tweed, but still looked expensive.","Got tons of compliments at work on this one."
"work","it fit perfectly, and the fabric was thick which is super necessary for white!","loved it, will probably rent again!"
"work","Sturdy material will a different yet classic neckline.","Pockets are always a bonus.","Dess was a little short for my line of work but not obnoxious."
"work","Love this color for fall and got compliments from strangers at my new job.","Id recommend wearing it with fitted bottoms as it is veeerrry baggy.","The sleeves are a little long, although that may be intentional."
"work","I received so many compliments on this dress at the office.","The fabric is thick and high quality, and it stretches to accommodate an early 2nd trimester bump.","If youre tall, this may be a little short for the office, but at 53, this hit about 2 in.","above the knee and felt modest enough for my office.","Will definitely rent again!"
"work","Very comfortable.","Nice fabric - kind of pebbled in appearance.","Also a nice pleat detail on the lower hem."
"work","I love the way it ties closed, and how soft and comfortable it is.","I often find sleeves are short on me, but these were perfect.","Im a 2 or 4 in blazers usually and ordered the 4.","The fit was fine and comfy, but I think Ill get a 2 next time for a slimmer fit."
"work","Let me start by saying that I am a true pear shape.","I ordered this dress thinking that it was more a-line, and it is not .It hugged in places I didnt really want to be hugged.","It wasnt terrible, but wasnt flattering.","Also, the colors were a bit drab.","I was expecting the blue to pop more against the black and it was more navy.","Overall, very underwhelmed."
"work","Im becoming a big fan of Collective dresses!","Many co-workers complimented the white cut-out design.","Its the perfect dress for a professional setting.","Highly recommend!"
"work","I ordered this for a work trip... very packable and didnt wrinkle which was great!","I love the length - I am 55 so it hit just below my knees for that midi look which I love.","The dress is form fitting but very stretchy - I would probably order a 4 next time around.","Material is very thick and sturdy, so it didnt show lines, etc."
"work","obsessed with this jumpsuit.","perfect fit and super flattering.","have gotten so many compliments!"
"work","I loved this blazer so much, I found it on eBay and bought it.","It fit beautifully, and dressed up any look.","The short back looked so chic with a dress or high-waisted pant."
"work","Great for TX weather.","Its lightweight and fits nicely - I normally would get a 2, but went with a 0 and am glad I did.","Theres a bit of a sheen to the fabric, but its not overly shiny.","Overall I really liked this jacket except that the fabric was already snagged in a few spots when I got it."
"work","I liked the color and style of the shirt.","The fit was good but looked better tucked in than not.","Was perfect for work (which is a business casual desk job)."
"work","Despite the fact that the pattern doesnt line up at the seam, this is a winner, winner, chicken dinner dress.","The fabric is not what I expected - I think I expected a rayon crepe, but this is a stretchy dress - not stiff like neoprene, but like neoprenes relaxed cousin.","As a result, its thick enough to obscure undergarments, but sturdy enough to give you a terrific shape.","For busty women (despite what my profile says Im 34DD), it does not, at all, flatten or pinch and the bust dart is placed really well.","My only complaint is that its too distinctive for me to get away with wearing to work again on Monday (its Friday as I type)!"
"work","Really comfy and great length."
"work","It was flowy and beautiful and so easy!","Got a few compliments and didnt want to let it go.","I would 100% recommend wearing!","Very flattering and could be dressed up or down!"
"work","This is a cute jacket but the fabric is thin enough that the interior pocket seams and bulk show through to the front of the jacket.","If it were in a darter color it wouldnt be as noticeable.","Ill keep looking for the winter white, lightweight jacket Im looking for (living in LA)."
"work","This dress fits amazing, is great quality, and i got a lot of compliments!"
"work","This was so long!","Im 52 and it was mid-calf (super unflattering!).","It also was so tight in the bus that I couldnt even zip it and had to wear it with a blazer over it.","One of the rentals I would have tried on the store and immediate passed on."
"work","This is like an upscale version of the t shirt dress but remains casual due to the unhemmed bottom edge.","Very comfortable, wore it all day and got a lot of complements!"
"work","I wore this to work and probably should have gotten the 4.","The v-neck was a little too open and low cut (and I even have a fairly large chest) so I had to wear a cami under it.","Got many compliments on the colors though!"
"work","European sizes are confusing, so it is understandable that RTR got this one wrong: it is EU size, but  RTR used French sizes when converting it to US sizes.","I rented a size 4 and got a European size 38 (normally a US size 8).","So check the European size before you order."
"work","I really loved this dress.","Its true, the ribbon is very tight around the waist but I think that helps make the shape of the dress extra flattering.","You just have to be careful zipping it around the ribbon.","Its kind of sticky.","As it turns out, it was just a touch too revealing for the work event to which I had originally planned to wear it.","But, my husband LOVED it.","(See low cut front.","Ha!)","Will definitely rent again for a more appropriate event."
"work","Was a little snug, so shapewear is a must.","However, it is sexy without looking intentional, and comfortable.","A total confidence-builder."
"work","I wasnt sure how well this shirt would look on me, given that I am very curvy and petite.","It looked great!","It made me look slimmer, was super-flattering with work pants or jeans, and was very cute.","Loved it!"
"work","This dress was great for Unlimited - it was appropriate for work, but I still loved wearing it out to dinner.","Fit was great, it flowed beautifully.","My two concerns: the darts on the front of the dress awkwardly end right at the nipple area, and pucker out, so it was a little embarrassing.","I also felt that the dress got a bit short when I sat down in the back.","Overall, I would rent this again, since the silhouette was so flattering."
"work","Fits snug, especially through the arms.","I think it looks great the way its shown in the photo - white tee, faded jeans."
"work","The dress is true to size.","The waist line cinched nicely and the shimmer was a bonus.","Good length for me at 5 feet ending right above the knee."
"work","Loved the patterns of the lace.","Very flattering and comfortable"
"work","The color is perfect for once youve gotten your base tan for the summer and are looking for a work dress that is comfortable but still eye catching.","I paired it with block heels and it was great."
"work","I was on the fence about the dress until I tried it on and fell in love with the look.","The fabric is substantial without adding unnecessary bulk.","The silhouette was quite striking due to both the overall cut and the strategic  ruching (able to eat lunch and not look like it)!","Two thumbs up!"
"work","I wore this to a work conference Mid September and it was the perfect weather for it.","It is pretty thin but I didnt feel cold.","It got tons of compliments.","Ill be looking to buy it because it is really versatile.","I wore tan suede shoes that looked like it matched.","However: RTR really has to find a dry cleaner that focuses on armpits cleaning.","I drove to the conference so I didnt have an opportunity to even sweat but I smelled by the time I got to there.","Not my smell though so I know it came from the dress.","Its definitely a problem Ive experienced with other dresses."
"work","It ran little large on me, but it was cute dress.","I would recommend for work/everyday."
"work","Wow, I loved this dress!","It still had the tags on when it arrived (bonus!)","and the knit fabric was beautiful.","The stripes are black, white, cream, navy, and bronze.","Its a very curve-hugging look, but still work-appropriate because of the length and coverage.","It was a lot longer on my than the model and it definitely needed to be paired with heels.","The materials stretched out a little throughout the day (especially the sleeve length) but it wasnt too noticeable.","I would definitely rent this again!"
"work","The sheen of the fabric made it look ultimately too dressy for work and I wore this for fun instead.","The fabric glimmered slightly.","The dress fits amazingly and is very very comfortable and easy to put on.","Thinner fabric than I expected."
"work","I sized down to a small and it fit right but style still looked too much like a sack on me."
"work","Cute top, wear with something high waisted because it is a bit short."
"work","Wore it on a plane, for a full day of meetings and out to dinner and felt polished the whole time!"
"work","This dress was very beautiful and perfect for a summer wedding.","If you are on the shorter side, you will definitely need to wear heels.","I am 5’9 and this dress was long enough with flats.","34C bra, 135 lbs.","As I am tall and thin I still needed to go up a size due to the zipper once it hit my rib cage area (like all the other reviews).","All and all I loved this dress.","It was classy and beautiful"
"work","The fit is good if you do not want anything form fitting in the middle.","It is a great work dress."
"work","Beautiful design, cut, fabric and perfect length.","Totally versatile for work, daytime etc...I rented this a few times now"
"work","Hugs your curves and has a beautiful shape with the back pleats.","Wish I owned it!"
"work","Nice relaxed fit.","Great for my business trip.","I would have bought it if it was a little cheaper.","The top was a bit hard to iron but other than that I loved it!"
"work","One of the reasons I love RTR is that I can try dresses I would typically never wear!","This dress is super unique and something I would have never thought to try on in store.","In my opinion its made for girls who are tall, straight and narrow- Im tall, but not so narrow...I have a little hip, and it kind of pulled in a weird way as the fabric has zero give.","The top was almost roomy, so I dont think a size up would help but maybe Ill try that next time.","The collar is a nice feminine touch, and the belt can be worn tied in the front,  back, or side.","There is a front slit in the skirt which allows for movement when you walk.","It wrinkles fairly easily but was easy to flatten out with a steamer."
"work","This was a very pretty top.","The sleeves were a little tight around my arms but other than that it was great!"
"work","I loved how this skirt fit - the material is great, and its a fun yet classic style.","However, I ended up not wearing it because I felt it was maybe too much going on for my office and work style.","I would rent it again in the future for a party or other type of event though."
"work","Wore this amazing skirt to work and it was so comfy.","Badgley  runs very true to size.","I normally wear a 6 on the bottom but the 4 fit perfect!","The waistline hit perfectly at my natural waist and I paired the skirt with a crop top.","Great quality fabric, would love to buy this skirt!"
"work","I wore the dress to work.","Nothing fantastic about except for the color.","It runs to true to size and was very comfortable to wear."
"work","The bottom of the dress fit great and was super flattering.","I just couldnt figure out the top...I felt sloppy.","I liked the draped idea but it was almost too drapey and big.","When I lifted my arm the arm holes were so big you could see straight through to my bra and stomach, which made me nervous to wear to work.","I ended up wearing a black tank top underneath it.","I also couldnt figure out how to tie the bow without it looking messy.","I wonder if I had a larger bust to fill out the top if it might look better."
"work","This dress is so playful and colorful!","The pattern is beautiful and I loved the fit.","There are two slits on the bottom that create a beautiful flow when you walk.","I loved the intricate designs and decorative buttons along the bottom of the dress.","The dress is a bit loose on top, so you may want to size down!","LOVED this dress!"
"work","little big but okay"
"work","The dress is more of a wine color than a true red as it appears in the picture.","It is a dressier crepe type fabric."
"work","I wore it with nude heels and it looked professional but happy!","It was really comfortable for work."
"work","Runs true to size except in the bust - I wear a 34DD and there was room left over, kind of an odd fit.","A bit short for work, for me, but Im very tall.","I did receive lots of compliments so if it had been a bit longer Id have considered buying it."
"work","True to size"
"work","HELLO CLEAVAGE!","If this dress is remotely small on you, youll be fussing with it all day (at least I was) to make sure the ladies remained covered.","It is a true wrap dress, with no real safety net (read: hidden buttons) to keep the dress fastened in the event that the tie becomes undone."
"work","I have a larger bust so I was a little nervous how this dress would fit.","However, it has great stretch and fits like a glove.","Its a little short for a more conservative workplace but a great dress (and a great color) overall!"
"work","I have a long torso so sometimes tailored dresses can hit my waist too high, but this one was perfect!"
"work","Really flattering dress!","I received a ton of compliments on it.","Im glad I sized up, because my normal dress size would have been too tight in the bust/ribcage."
"work","Pros: Very comfortable and fit in all the right places.","Cons: Heavier material so def more a fall/winter dress."
"work","I want to buy this dress- travels well."
"work","Beautiful fabric.","I almost didnt wear it because it is so wide, it made me feel a bit like I was wearing a sheet.","I think a smaller size may have helped some."
"work","Should I be embarrassed Ive already worn this top twice in one week?","Nope!","I love the fit and flair, particularly when its paired with fitted pants.","Its a heavier denim, longer in the front and shorter in the back."
"work","I thought this was a great dress, it was very comfortable, feminine and I received many compliments while wearing it.","There is a camisole underneath and the fabric has a bit of give to it which made it comfortable.","However, I thought the arm holes were a bit small and if you have very sensitive skin it may not be the best choice as where the lace touches the skin was a little irritating."
"work","Fit was loose, and comfortable.","Slightly lower top button than I was comfortable with, so I wore a higher neck undershirt."
"work","I loved this dress - I may even rent it again!","It was incredibly comfy and soft for work.","Very flattering fit, with plenty of room in the hips (I dont normally look great in sheath dresses).","The sleeves were delicate and floaty, and I loved the pretty flow detail.","The color was bright and the dress was in perfect condition!"
"work","Perfect for a wedding, date, or even work."
"work","As a shift, the shape of this dress can be troubling for anyone who doesnt look like Taylor Swift.","I have her boyish frame, but not her height, so this ended up looking a little more formal on me than preferred due to how long it ended up being (mid-shin).","To dress it down, I put my hair up in a messy braided bun and wore brown flat sandals.","It was so light and pretty to wear, so I made sure to get 2-3 wears out of it, but its definitely trickier than my usual dress."
"work","I LOVED this dress.","It was perfect for a formal work luncheon.","I got several compliments and loved the way it fit.","Very flattering, was tighter up top, cinched the natural waist line and flowed out the rest of the way.","I would definitely rent it again!"
"work","This dress was flattering and fit well.","The color block makes this dress more interesting than an ordinary black dress."
"work","Gorgeous; so many compliments.","Just note that its low-cut in the front.","So if youre uncomfortable showing cleavage or chest, it may not be your thing.","Use wardrobe tape :)"
"work","This dress was just OK, the pattern is vibrant and fun, but the overall fit on me wasnt the most flattering.","Also, the material seemed really cheap and and the bottom hem was completely unfinished, so fraying a bit.","Definitely not a favorite, but I wore it to work with a cardigan anyway."
"work","I wore this dress for a speaking engagement for work.","I thought it was very professional AND fashionable!","It is flattering overall for a curvy gal like me.","As some others have mentioned, it has some shine, shimmer, grey tones, and lace detail that dont show up in the photos.","I recommend  this dress!"
"work","The top part fit great and was very flattering, however, the bottom is very loose & baggy on me and comes to right at the middle of my knees (not a flattering spot) .","I know Im short (50) but on the model its showing the dress hitting waaaay above the knee.","If it was a little more fitted on bottom and a little shorter, I would love it."
"work","I got non stop compliments on this dress at work.","It fit perfectly as if it were custom tailored for me.","I almost bought it off my Unlimited because it fit so well and I got so many compliments, but I love renting new things too much.","I highly recommend this dress.","Its totally fine for larger bust sizes (Im 36D) too and still hits at a nice length when youre shorter (Im 54)."
"work","This dress fits perfectly and the color is really pretty.","It feels a bit basic (both in its simplicity and the fact that it would look great paired with Lilly prints at Carolina Cup) but I think it has the potential to be styled in a lot of different ways.","Looking forward to wearing it this spring!"
"work","I wore this for work.","I wore it with a turtleneck similar to the one shown on the model.","Very soft and cozy!"
"work","Skirt is beautiful, though the material does stick together when you sit down.","Luckily I stand all day, so didnt really have that problem.","Im usually a size 6, but sized up which was the correct choice.","Pretty skirt and perfect for work!"
"work","Normally a size 6, but the 6 was a little ill fitting on me personally.","I am trying the size 4 to see if that fits better.","The color of the dress was vibrant as it appears and the quality of fabric was top notch."
"work","The dress is a dream!","Highlights the good stuff and hides the lumps and bumps.","Even better, the print is so vibrant and the skirt has great movement.","I wore it to the office, but could easily see this being appropriate for an outdoor wedding as well.","I lost count of the number of compliments I received on it.","I may just have to buy it!"
"work","The dress fit me well and I felt confident and comfortable in it.","I received some compliments, but overall, I felt that the dress was understated (as opposed to show-stopping or memorable).","Since the weather was a bit chilly, I wore it with tights and the skirt material did cling to my tights and hiked up when I walked.","That was the only downside."
"work","Very comfortable with great definition on the style.","The train in front gave it just enough style without being too overwhelming in a work setting."
"work","Great fit, very flattering, the material is lightweight but has some substance.","The picture does not do it justice.","Do not want to part with it."
"work","The slit in the top was too low for work, so I wore a nude bandeau top and the dress looked perfect.","The collar lace was worn down and folded over, so it didnt look  exactly like the photo.","The edge of the lace on the arms had the same problem.","Easy to wear the dress and easy to wear the proper undergarments with the lace pattern."
"work","This is a great take on a basic black skirt.","The ruffle at the bottom makes it fun, but too memorable to wear every week, so perfect as a rental.","The material is very soft and stretchy, making this very comfortable."
"work","Loved this dress.","The slit is sexy so wear some nice heels!","The cons were the zipper it was hard to pull up, and also the shoulders were a bit loose but over all it was great fit."
"work","Great top.","However, I ended up wearing a large.","The medium fit, but way too tight on the chest area.","I am a 34D / size 8.","The large was work appropriate."
"work","Perfect way to try out the bell sleeve trend.","Fits well through the torso and well get neckline."
"work","Fit nice, a different LBD.","Material was heavy but stretchy around the bust and waist."
"work","fits well, great dress!"
"work","This is an easy dress to wear if you want an easy-breezy minimalist look that doesnt look cheap.","Full disclosure, I rented it for a trade show...","I was on my feet, bloated from a travel diet, tired, etc.","Putting this on made being presentable and stylish with little effort."
"work","Slightly small (not unwearably, but not the most comfortable) but it was very flattering.","The color is beautiful, and the side ruffle/slit makes it special"
"work","Super cute!","Love the wrap style and slightly poofy, fun skirt.","Only issue was one that I have with many dresses and tops -- the top is very low/prone to opening so for work I will probably tape and wear a cami underneath.","But really like this dress and love how it could be for work or going out!"
"work","This style is a must!","I love that the back slit adds a modern twist to your everyday black blazer.","Because of this slit, the blazer fits rather large, so if you want a more fitted look, I recommend sizing down for your primary rental.","I recommend pairing this with a bold top so it peeks through the slit back detailing throughout the day - LOVE!"
"work","Very classy.","Gorgeous color and comfortable too!"
"work","This is a slim fitting blouse that was very flattering.","I loved that the cut was not boxy and that at 510 the length was great--was able to easily tuck into pants.","I also liked the fact that the buttons started right around the middle of the boobs.","I wore a cami bra underneath for work and just a bra for the weekend."
"work","fit well on the top and had nice hourglass shape cut into it, however the hips were a bit big for my straight frame.","still flattering though.","only complaint is the fabric on the neck is itchy."
"work"," It was very comfortable, however runs a little big in the waist although the top piece of the dress covers that.","I would highly recommend this dress, and if trying to decided between 2 sizes choose the smaller one!"
"work","Was a little warm but now that the weather is getting cooler it would be perfect."
"work","A little bulky, I paired with skinnies and floral stilettos to sex up the Victorian sleeves.","It was a perfectly fine sweater, but certainly not a power outfit for me."
"work","The pattern and colors on this outfit are gorgeous.","It is actually two pieces - the under part is a dress with straps and then a loose blouse that goes over top.","The skirt is slightly short and the under dress was tight, but I normally wear a 12 so I think it fits TTS.","It was lightweight even though it is long-sleeved.","I wore it to both church and then on work before sending it back and got lots of compliments.","A unique outfit and not something I would normally pick up in a store."
"work","Very classy piece!","Also very comfortable, the lining on the inside felt like butter.","I work it for work- kept it simple with a black 3/4 sleeve cotton top and nude flats.","Received many compliments."
"work","I wore this to work and it was super comfortable.","I wish it was longer, length was a few inches above the knee, but otherwise its a great dress for work and then drinks after.","It was a little big and maybe a little long in the torso on me (or maybe my hips are too big), so will try a smaller size next time.","Great dress!"
"work","Beautiful color and very forgiving (almost too baggy).","I wanted to wear this for a summer day in the office but it was really too low cut to be appropriate."
"work","Ive loved all of the other outfits from this designer but this one was very meh.","Im 511 and it hit mid shin, on anyone shorter it would have looked silly.","Pass"
"work","It fit great up top, but the bottom was not as form fitted as I expected.","It sort of ballooned a bit out.","All in all, a fabulous, striking dress with lots of saturated color."
"work","Loved this dress so much I bought it!","Pictures dont do it justice.","Its a nice light material with a bold floral pattern.","I love the cape on the back - adds a little bit of flare without being overstated.","Highly recommend!"
"work","I was hesitant to order this dress because there were no reviews, but I am sooo glad that I did!","It fits beautifully -super flattering.","Nice details around the neck and shoulder.","Love it!"
"work","Wore this to a Saturday morning work brunch/client event.","Felt very comfortable and such a beautiful dress.","Could easily be styled to be work-conservative or styled to be more fun for a night out.","Versatile and easy to wear."
"work","The sleeves make this dress with the patterned cutouts.","Note there is no belt included.","So make sure you have something that will go with dress, as it needs a belt."
"work","Perfect fit...works for casual, work or formal event"
"work","Gorgeous fit- big in bust for a 34a; would order a 2.","Im 125 lbs, 58.","Waist and bust too big."
"work","Previous reviewers were spot on.","Paired this top with high waisted black pants and it was stunning.","So comfortable - so much fun.","Highly recommend.","I will definitely rent again."
"work","This blouse is amazing.","The color is exactly like the photo and it fit me perfectly.","I did receive a blouse with a few water stains (on left cuff and on my chest) hence the 4 star rating instead of 5 but the stains werent terribly noticeable.","Would definitely rent again."
"work","Was a bit short for my workplace, but I added tights and I loved the overall look.","Great fall/winter dress with navy tights and boots.","Would buy this dress."
"work","The shirt overall was larger than expected for a Small.","I had to roll the sleeves because they were too long and I decided to belt it to make it more complimentary to my small waist.","Overall it was just what a wanted, a unique twist on the standard white blouse."
"work","So many compliments!","It fits like a glove and holds everything in.","This dress hugs curves!",":) I love this dress and would rent over and over again."
"work","Really cute and formal.","Wore it for a big client meeting.","Loved the pocket."
"work","The material on this dress was thicker than I had anticipated when I ordered it, however, it was surprisingly cool to wear to work during the summer.","The fit was great and it was a great quality.","I received many compliments."
"work","This is clearly a high quality garment but it had a a boxy fit.","having curves I needed something with a little bit more shape but I bet this would look great on someone with a different shape."
"work","Wish I got the XS but very cute for work and pretty comfy"
"work","I loved the look of this top.","The lace with the lining made it very wearable.","I know it is a looser style, but I felt like it was a little too loose.","It fit looser on my than on the picture and I felt the fit made it a little frumpy.","I would definitely advise sizing down."
"work","I love DVF because she makes professional wear look sexy.","This dress is snug in all the right places.","I am a 4 and chose a 6 in this because RTR didnt have my size.","Im glad I did because the bust was a little tight.","Im a 34 B. I will definitely rent this one again."
"work","I wore this for an interview and it was comfortable and exactly as pictured.","It was very tight in the hips though and through the arms.","I would have been more comfortable ordering one size up."
"work","Love this dress - super easy to wear, conservative enough for work with a little edge and tons of compliments.","Reviews say this dress runs large but I feel it is true to size.","It is not supposed to be form fitting but it will not make you feel like you are wearing a sack.","Rent this one!"
"work","These pants are a great color.","Perfect for summer.","I also loved the look of them on me from in front.","The only reason I am not keeping them is because it fit a little odd on my bottom.","They did not look bad but it felt a little uncomfortable.","The pockets also appeared to be a little open.","Maybe a larger size would have taken care of that problem, but they looked so good in front with that size, that I did not care.","I wore it with a long white boyfriend blazer so the pockets were not noticeable.","If it was just a bit more comfortable in the back over my thighs, I would have kept them because they really are a great pair of pants."
"work","This is the cutest skirt!","I wore it with a jean shirt to a work meeting and got a lot of compliments on it."
"work","This is a beautiful and demure dress.","Incredible color and fit.","I have an hourglass figure so often dresses without some stretch tend to either look too big in the waist or tight in the hips and bust.","Not this one.","It was perfect.","It fit as though I had just had it tailored.","I will absolutely rent again!"
"work","loved the fabric, structure, cut of this shirt.","wore it with cropped straight black pants, nude heels and carried a nude/beige bag.","lots of compliments."
"work","Love these, fit was perfect, material beautiful, look, stylish great.","Only thing I was not paying attention, not a full length pant, no good for February, but will reorder for summer weather wear."
"work","Pretty color.","Unusual dress & a little hard to figure out at first.","Cinch the ties on the side to gather the material in the back & kind of keep it from being too baggy in the front.","Got a lot of compliments because it was such an unusual design."
"work","Overall this is a cute ensemble.","It is a slip dress with a separate button down top/tie part.","However, the color on mine was faded and it gets SOOOO wrinkly after sitting down for 5 min, which ultimately makes it look cheap.","I would not rent/wear again."
"work","Comfortable and stylish- I paired this with a white blazer and Vince mules for work, and the subtle cut outs were great to dress it up for after work drinks!","The fit is pretty loose, but I ordered a size up to fit my chest."
"work","Super cute little dress.","Loved the fact that I could tie the waist to nip it in!","The print is adorable and it was nice and breezy for a hot summer day at work."
"work","The top is very cute.","Fitted in the chest and sleeves, but a peplum-style bottom.","The peplum starts a little higher than most, so you could get away with this if youre pregnant.","The material is very sturdy and keeps its shape all day."
"work","This is one of my go to dresses!","Ive worn it to non-profit interviews as well as on vacation, so it is very versatile.","I have gotten compliments every time!","The fit is loose but still shows off your figure.","The detail is so pretty.","I love how it can be paired with tennis shoes or a more formal heel or bootie.","I will probably be renting once again in the near future!","I found it to be true to size."
"work","I work in a professional field, and this fit in well.","Great for pear shapes since it hides the hips and any poochy tummies!","The only issues I had was with the neckline (way too low for work!","), so I wore a camisole.","The fabric was also thinner than I expected, so I also wore a slip-- which is highly recommended on a windy day with this dress!","I dont know what it would be like on someone taller, but on me, it was more tea length, and I rather shorter."
"work","Fits like a classy little glove.","Was told on more than one occasion that I looked like Claire Underwood - and I definitely take that as a compliment!"
"work","I am usually a 12 and sometimes a 14, depending on style.","I could not zip this piece up past my waist.","I have a 38C bust and narrow shoulders.","My arms however are large.","The sleeves were very tight even though I could not zip up.","That said I have large hips and behind and that part was OK.","This dress would be short for me at 50, so for tall people, it may not be optimal.","The dress was much more beautiful and high quality in person than the picture shows!","Beautiful dress.","I just need a bigger size."
"work","Rented this for work.","Fabric on the top half of the dress is a thinner knit than the lower half.","I usually wear size 4 and rented a S.  I wear 34B and every outline of my underwire bra is visible when wearing this dress.","Would need a tank or shape wear.","I chose to wear a cardigan on top for work.","The color is great and it is very comfortable.","After initially trying it on, I was only going to give 2 stars, but I got so many compliments when I wore it that I feel it deserves 4."
"work","This was really easy to wear and got lots of compliments.","If you want it to be form fitting you might want to size down as it has plenty of stretch.","I paired it with a black turtleneck, tights and flats."
"work"," A classic DVF wrap dress, nothing extraordinary about it.","As per the usual with DVF the fabric was high quality and the tailoring was well done."
"work","I wore this to work and dressed it down for casual Friday with a scarf and bright red flats!","Loved the color and the fit.","It did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but was very comfortable."
"work","This dress was beautiful on the hanger, but just didnt lay right on me.","I still wore it to work, but decided to belt it so that it didnt feel so much like a sack.","I may have just gotten the wrong size, but it was overly large.","The color is gorgeous, so I was bummed that it was unflattering on."
"work","So tight in my normal size but I didnt have time to get another size before the event so I wore it.","Recieved many compliments but would have been comfortable one size larger."
"work","Runs very true to size - especially in the waist.","Top has tons of stretch and is very comfortable.","I am a 6-8 and curvy so this worked for me, but was certainly aware of my mid section all day.","Got more compliments than I expected as this isnt as showy as many other RTR picks!"
"work","Thick material that doesnt feel or look cheap.","I loved how it brought out my shape and fitted my curves.","Just make sure you rent a back up or something large than you ever would.","Ive been able to wear a 2 in almost everything for RTR and had to get a 6 for this dress to make it work."
"work","At first it is a little different because the seam arent in normal spots.","After that  it is very figure flattering because it hugs the body in a natural way.","The material is t shirt soft."
"work","I loved this dress.","Fit was great.","I am 54 so it hit just below the knee and right above it when I sat down.","Was perfect for a morning work meeting, and later a retirement reception."
"work","Even though its a true wrap, it wouldnt open at all in the chest area.","The fabric felt a bit heavy but not too bad, and the length of the tie was great to make a statement.","Overall, great piece to rent!","I definitely received compliments that day"
"work","This dress is a fabulous fit and flare dress.","The material is very heavy which makes the dress seem more rich and vibrant.","I work it to work and when i went out for a walk women were stopping me on the street to compliment me on it.","I think this dress can be a fun fall favorite with a cute leather jacket on it."
"work","Theory tends to run small so I tried a size 6 and then even re-ordered a size 4, which was still too big.","Not a form-fitting blazer, would size down."
"work","High quality textile, comfortable fit."
"work","I love this jacket and would consider buying it myself.","Great texture than can be worn for both the office and out.","I would definitely rent this again!"
"work","I hardly have big boobs and I was busting out of it.","It is also very short."
"work","This fit very well, heavier fabric with a lot of movement, hangs well on the body.","Very classy with sexy feminine ruffles.","Conservative length, but has pretty movement when walking."
"work","I wore this to a parade for memorial Day - It was adorable.","Very good quality material and flattering for any figure."
"work","I loved that this dress was tighter on the bust and loosened up in the problem areas.","The fabric doesnt wrinkle and withstood a rainstorm!","The racerback is so flattering and I loved wearing it from work to a baseball game!","Highly recommend for all sorts of occasions."
"work","As described in other reviews, the material was fairly heavy which made it work appropriate.","Im 53 and it hit right in mid thigh which was on the margin of what Id consider professional so taller ladies may want to be aware for work type events.","Nevertheless, the silhouette was super flattering and the pockets were a nice bonus."
"work","This is a mad-men style dress.","It really shows off curves.","This dress is stunning."
"work","Attractive silk shirt, a little low cut for my taste, but overall, quite lovely."
"work","I loved the way this dress fit.","I wish I had taken pictures.","Lots of compliments at work."
"work","Looked nice BUT Runs quite large.","Order down a size (or maybe even 2)"
"work","runs large.","felt like it was hanging off my body.","school girl/uniform feel.","not flattering."
"work","I ordered the 4 as a back-up size (originally a 2), but I tried this on first, and it fit so perfectly I didnt bother opening the 2.","I wore this for a black-tie gala that I was in charge of for work.","It was extremely comfortable, and didnt budge while I was running around, while also looking elegant (I had tons of compliments).","Although the back is sheer, I wore this with a standard black bra, and it blended in perfectly.","With a snugger fit (maybe the 2), it would work without a bra - this would have likely been my option if I wore it for a non-work event, but the extra room in the larger size did not offer enough support."
"work","The dress fit great.","A little longer than I expected but Im only 54 so Im not mad about it.","I got lots of compliments on the fit and the style.","It was perfect for my stage presentation."
"work","This is a great piece, but beware it runs small!","Order a size up, as this is the kind of top that looks good with a little room anyway.","I wore it with coated jeans for a perfect work to happy hour transitional outfit."
"work","Got lots of compliments.","Very flattering - hides the tummy well."
"work","This dress fit perfectly.","Fit nicely through the torso, not tight at the bust or arms, where I normally have problems.","It was so cute, I kept it for quite a while.","I dressed it up with a statement necklace and heels for a party and wore it with booties for date night.","I should have just bought it!","I still might!"
"work","I loved this dress so much I bought it when it went on sale at Nordstrom.","At first I wasnt so sure about it but it grew on me.","I get compliments every time I wear it.","Its a great dress for the casual summer dress code I have in my office.","It also goes great with a pair of sandals, pumps, or sneakers!","The dress is very comfortable and it also has pockets!"
"work","Rented for work thru unlimited.","Easy to wear as material is very stretchy.","The inside slip was loose and hung down behind hem hence the 4 stars.","Hits right above knee so great length."
"work","Very pretty"
"work","I LOVED this dress, no seriously, I wish I owned it.","I was very worried about only an XS being available, but it actually fit me so perfectly it could have been custom made.","Highly recommend this dress, perfect for work, wedding or any event truly!"
"work","I love this dress.","It was really comfortable.","I wore it with a navy blazer.","The fabric was flexible and easy to wear.","Got nice compliments on it too."
"work","Lovely details and flattering shape make this knit dress a wonderful dress for work or daytime occasions."
"work","fit perfectly"
"work","Very professional and flattering!","I love this navy dress for work or a work party.","This runs true to size and we recommend sizing up for your backup size.","This is fitted at the natural waist, so we do recommend that curvier women size up.","This may be worn with a standard bra and the fabric is very stretchy.","Pair this with nude heels and Miguel Ases earrings!"
"work","Wore for a work event and evening out in Dubai - it was perfect!!!","Wanted to keep this - would 100% rent again for vacation or a summer party/event.","Definitely runs big - am a 6/8 and the S had room.","Wore with short heeled sandals and R length was great - would have needed epically high heels to wear a long."
"work","Wore this for a work conference during the day with a white blazer.","The color was awesome and the fit on the bottom was great.","Biggest issue for me, that others have also mentioned is the gap at the top.","when you sit or move your arms there becomes a gap under the hook, seems like it needs an additional hook, but that just may be the design of the dress.","I would not have been able to wear it if I had a bigger bust."
"work","Very comfortable, high-quality material, moved very nicely.","Im 55 and was able to wear it with flats.","Recommend for work.","Not difficult to get in and out of."
"work","I thought I could wear this with a cardigan and some lowtop white Converse for a low key Friday office outfit.","Ummmm NO.","The material is crepey and looks like a straight up bridesmaid dress from J.Crew.","Also the bodice is rather long so it didnt hit at my natural waist, it kept going to the uppermost part of the hips (and Im 59.5).","Finally, I have rented two other Adeam dresses in size 2 for a perfect fit, but my 32DDD bust could BARELY fit into the top, and in fact by the end of the day I had red pressure marks inside from how tight it pressed on my strapless bra.","I still gave it 3 stars, because it really would be a great bridesmaid dress for a very tall, smaller busted woman.","But thats it."
"work","I was lucky enough to be the first person to wear the dress sent to me!","My colleagues really liked this dress.","The fabric definitely feels topnotch and the pattern is clean, pretty, and professional.","Im docking a star because of the flat, horizontal collar.","It doesnt quite sit flat so I tugged at the hem all day, because the collar would scrunch up awkwardly around my chest all the time.","But not a huge deal."
"work","Form fitting dress with a cute hem.","Stretchy, thick fabric made this really comfortable.","Flatters the curves, looks great with a black blazer too."
"work","Definitely a bigger cut but that is the look of the jacket.","People complimented the color and the larger cut of the jacket.","Someone said it would make any outfit look good."
"work","It fit perfectly, hugging just in the right places."
"work","I wore this dress in a size 6 at 23 weeks pregnant for a black tie work event and it was perfect - stomach area was super comfortable and the length was great with heels (Im 54).","My stomach is about 39 right now so the size 6 was a good pick."
"work","I wore this for a work meeting.","I liked that it was an easy fabric (light knit) and shape, but was still very professional looking.","The cream top stitching is a great detail.","As other reviewers noted, the bottom hem tended to curl, but it wasnt terribly noticeable.","Would likely rent again (seriously contemplated buying!)"
"work","I wore this to a daytime work event (can easily be worn for an evening work function or a night out) and I got a TON of compliments!!","The fabric and cut were super flattering; I loved absolutely everything about it!"
"work","The fabric and lining are a little heavy and not as breathable.","I would recommend this for early fall or late spring."
"work","This is a really tight fitting dress.","The sleeves are VERY tight.","I had to ask for a replacement, as the dress I go has a ripped elbow - which is understandable.","But it is a stunning dress.","I got so many compliments, even got told I looked like a model in it.","Maybe a little tight for work, but great for a party."
"work","I was one of a few women presenting at a very large conference.","The jumpsuit was the ideal mix of comfort, edge, and sophistication.","The front doesnt dip too low and the pants are comfortable without being too tight.","The capelet is subtle enough to not look costumey.","Huge fan!"
"work","I love love this shirt.","I wore it 3x!","Its a gorgeous jewel tone that is so flattering.","I wore it to work, to brunch and even tucked into a pencil skirt for an interview.","The lace that comes up high on your neck is so delicate and flattering.","The bodice is lined so no need for a cami or anything and the little buttons on the back are so pretty."
"work","Super comfy, wish the smaller size had been available as it runs large"
"work","It was a little long for my 52 frame, but thats common for me."
"work","definitely true to size, some give"
"work","This dress looked nice.","It was a good choice for the office."
"work","This dress is a beautiful color coral and an overall very classic cut with a twist.","The sleeves are cut out so if you hold your arms down it looks long sleeve but once you start moving your arms come out of the sleeve and it is airy and perfect for summer."
"work","Fabric was super soft and comfortable.","The dress is beautiful."
"work","Nice top for spring and summer.","It fits true to size but seems a little high-waisted."
"work","Great fit.","Flattering neck line and also a lot of room for a big dinner :)"
"work","Length worked beautifully for work - not too short.","Fit true to size.","Follows form.","Flattering - several compliments.","Breathes - cooly comfortable on a warm night."
"work","PROS:  Figure flattering.","Bold top with a flared skirt with a very nice drape.","Comfortable to wear and appropriate for a work environment.","Interesting designer.","Well made.","CONS:  Nothing comes to mind.","Rental Condition: ExcellentFabric: Comfort: VerySeason(s): Early/Late FallSpecial Undergarments Required:  Racer back braSurprises: Flattering fitWould I rent it again?","Maybe.","Measurements Lying FlatBust: 15Waist: 13Hips: 18.5Length: 39"
"work","This dress was amazing for work!","I wore it with some cute pumps and a statement necklace.","Got tons of compliments on it.","The color is amazing and the dress overall is very comfortable too.","The length hits the same as on the model, but isnt too short for a work environment.","I wore a size small, which is my usual size"
"work","Ive rented many dresses from RTR and this is my favorite, hands down!","It was perfect for a panel I was on, as it helped me feel very confident being on stage when I was dressed so well.","The pockets allowed me to carry things like my phone and business cards, the color was to die for, and the length allowed me to sit in front of people without any worry that anything would show.","I highly recommend this dress."
"work","This top is very cute and comfortable, I love the lace down the arms...very fashionable.","I prefer shirts and sweaters that are longer to make me look leaner.","This top cuts you off at the worst possible spot.","I wore a black tank top underneath to elongate it.","Very soft material."
"work","I wore a size 4, it was a bit big in the bust (but I am a 34A on a good day!)","It hit me perfectly above the knee.","Was very form fitting above the flare of the skirt.","I will for sure rent this one again."
"work","I love this top because its cute but simple, and comfortable.","It is great for any cup size due to comfortable room at bust.","This top may be worn with any standard bra.","The opening in the front comes down kind of low, so be prepared for that!"
"work","I absolutely LOVED this dress.","It was a bit short, but since Im only 54 it looked fine with tights under it.","It was super comfortable and felt effortlessly chic.","Im pretty curvy so I was worried that it would have a boxy fit, but the shift style looked great on me.","Looking forward to renting it again when the weather is cooler!"
"work","Love this jumpsuit!","Im 59 and was worried the 2R would be too short but it fit perfectly with a pair of pumps.","The cut is flattering and the jumpsuit is very comfortable.","Highly recommend!"
"work","loose fit, and a bit worn out but a great color tl brighten up a drab winter wardrobe"
"work","Perfect for work.","Classy sophisticated look.","00 size did not exist on RTR, which was too bad."
"work","Fits true to size.","Nice quality on fabric and details.","Im 57, so the longer length worked, but it might swallow up a petite person.","I wore it just like the photo above- with a black long sleeve tee and white rolled up jeans.","Perfect casual but still professional outfit for a work conference."
"work","Beautiful form-fitting dress.","Comfort of a knitwear, but the fabric is sturdy enough that it works for the office.","Flattering, beautiful blue color.","I styled this with nude pumps and gold jewelry."
"work","For being on the small.","Side it was still comfortable"
"work","This dress looked interesting so I thought I would give it a try.","Turns out the whole this is made from this soft stretchy mesh fabric.","It is lined so you cannot see through it except for the v-neck.","There is no zipper so you just pull it on and go.","Very comfortable fabric, the length is awesome, I am 58 and it hit my knees so it is good for work.","It is a tad sexy, so I threw on a jacket during the day.","It was perfect for dinner and drinks later that night."
"work","I cannot wait to rent this dress again.","It is a bit heavy so for NYC 90 degree summer was a bit warm.","as soon as it gets cooler will rent again!.","Slightly snug around booty so if you are bootilicious size up."
"work","Endless compliments on this very professional, on-trend take on the standard sheath dress.","For those of you (like me) who are smaller on top, there was slight puckering at the seams between the breasts, which I believe would be solved by sizing down.","This dress shows off your assets in a very classy way.","Would buy it if the price comes down.","I will definitely rent this dress again, but will try a size down."
"work","Ordered this for just a usual day at work.","I ordered up a size bc Theory tends to run small for me.","Im 6-8 and wore a 10 and it fit nicely, not too much hugging.","Material is their typical suiting material.","Color isnt spectacular.","With a blazer, very work appropriate.","No bells and whistles."
"work","This work appropriate dress is a staple for your next event!","The material is stretchy and comfortable, making this a great fit for all bust sizes and ample room in the hips!","Pair with a statement necklace and black heels, this will be a hit!"
"work","The floral pattern from head to toe brought on a lot of compliments as it was perceived as a bold choice for the office by some of my colleagues - mainly the men.","Im 56 and felt the 4 hit me at an awkward length.","Its definitely longer than in the image.","It hit at the ankle bone, grazing the top of my foot so it needed to either be an inch or two shorter or longer.","Black pointed stilettos were the only shoes that looked right with it.","I also added a black and gold belt to break up the pattern.","Im usually a true 4 but I would probably have ordered a 6 as it did ride up in the crotch a tad.","Overall, it was a beautiful jumpsuit."
"work","I scouted the website until this dress became available in my size.","It was worth the search and the wait.","The fabric is thick and good quality.","It has plenty of stretch and hug without feeling like you have to suck in all day.","It is very flattering, especially with women who have hips.","The zig zag pattern at the top makes this dress a stand out no matter where you are.","I took this from work to weekend wear in a split second -- and I wore it every second I could!"
"work","Loved the silhouette of this dress and the comfortable, thick fabric, but the 8 was strangely large.","I wear Pink Tartan a lot, and I was surprised this didnt fit as I expected."
"work","The picture is after 15 hours in the dress so its looking a little tired.","But I wore the dress to work and then an event, and it was comfortable and cute for both.","The material is thick, but it did stretch a bit by the end of the day.","The waist where the black horizontal line of lace runs small - I sized up one size based on the reviews and was glad I did.","If you are bustier I would think you might have to size up two sizes because the top portion was pretty fitted on me as a 34A."
"work","I love this nude shade with a slight gold metallic sheen (well, nude on me at least) because it ever-so-slightly-and-subtlety adds an element of flirtiness to what could otherwise be considered a boring top.","I selected true to size fit because its supposed to be a looser, boxier fit, and my typical size made that fit look appropriate on me."
"work","Fun printed dress - had my eye on this for awhile and it was finally available in my size.","The dress is very flexible with the fit due to the belt - you can easily go up or down a size.","Would I rent again: Yes!","Compliments 3-4Styling suggestion - Use a belt, bright lipstick would work well here"
"work","The dress was shorter than I thought it would be, but it was still cute and work appropriate.","Liked the ruffle detail at the bottom.","Material was thick and comfortable."
"work","Nice summer dress for work.","The wrap style makes it very comfortable, but it is cut very low.","I needed to pin the top, or you could wear a camisole.","The fabric is night and light, but not see-through.","Would rent again!"
"work","Typically I would wear a 4 or a 6 in bottoms but I sized down as these have a higher waist.","I am so thrilled with how flattering they are!","I wore with a chunky heel sandal for work, and will pair with a sneaker for the weekend.","Got tons of compliments!"
"work","I do feel the dress runs small.","I am 56 about 116 and the xsmall was so small.","The small fit well and was very classic and elegant.","It is a comfortable, conservative dress, perfect for the occasion."
"work","Easy to wear - I wore with knee high boots, black jeggings, and a white shirt.","It falls past the pockets on my pants so I loved the way it looked with fitted pants and high heel boots.","Beautiful, comfortable, and professional!"
"work","This dress is cut straight from armpit to hem, with no shape to it.","That would have worked on a curvier gal, but I dont have enough chest to pull it off.","It seemed really warm though, and the color was nice - the blue is a very deep blue.","This would have worked for me if the cut had been different."
"work","Its true that this skirt is very full but that is one of the reasons that I loved it!","Its an unexpected look for the office and I received SO many compliments on this one.","It is super comfortable and could be coordinated with so many things.","Note that the dots are more of an ivory than a true white.","I first put on a white cami and had to change to ivory.","I would definitely rent this one again and would recommend to anyone.","Itll brighten your day!"
"work","I worn this for work, could have easily also worn for a date night.","Soft pink, beautiful top, well fitted.","High quality.","Would rent again."
"work","I normally wear a 4 or 6 depending on the brand, but the 4 was pretty large on me and I had to wear a belt with it.","I would have been better off with a size 2.","For the ladies who have hourglass figures like me, order a smaller size or this dress will be too wide around your waist."
"work","I wore a cami underneath because its very low cut.","With that it was perfect for work.","Professional and very comfortable.","Fit like a dream :)"
"work","Dress is thick and very stretchy.","The cut and the stretchy-ness make it easy to eat a big meal, and still hide the belly :)To me, this seems to run small.","My shoulders are wider than the sleeve seams, which rarely happens to me.","I think I will rent again, but maybe go up a size next time to see if the shoulders fit better."
"work","Surprisingly cute top!","It needs to be worn with high waisted slim cut pants or a pencil skirt to maximize the silhouette.","Quality material, worth the rental."
"work","Interesting and fun shirt.","Would love to own this one!"
"work","comfortable and great fabric.","perfect for a day at the office."
"work","I want to keep this dress!","Great for day-to-night.","Its a bit snug, but very polished and professional.","Love the print and the lightweight fabric!"
"work","So comfortable and lots of compliments"
"work","This is a pretty dress, and I was able to add a teal cardigan to wear it to work.","The fabric is a little heavier, but its comfortable and didnt wrinkle even after I sat all day.","Several reviewers said it ran large, but I thought my usual size fit fine."
"work","I found the sleeves to be the perfect length but overall the top was a little big and boxy."
"work","Kind of a heavy dress, wasnt really my style, mostly because it was knit."
"work","Love the fabric and weight for fall and winter.","Im conscious of cleavage in a professional environment so I wore a black tank underneath.","Would definitely rent again"
"work","I thought these would be appropriate for the office but unfortuantely, they are quite see-through except for white shorts underneath that felt too short for the office.","Its too bad because they are beautiful pants, maybe next summer for a casual outing."
"work","I normally am a 4 or 6 depending on the dress, but there were no reviews or pictures on this dress when I ordered it and no sizing notes, so I just went with the 6 (38).","I really liked this dress but might have sent it back without wearing it if I didnt have this belt in my closet because it was literally just a bag on me.","I should have gone down at least to a size 36/4.","But I got a lot of compliments on it with the belt so if it ends up being too big maybe try that to save it!"
"work","Amazing pants, one of my favorite rentals.","Running true to size, Id recommend sizing up for backup.","If youre curvier, you may want to size up for comfort.","The material is quite stretchy, allowing for movement and give.","These are versatile enough for work or a night out.","At 57 the length was perfect and hit a bit above my ankle, showing off the ruffle detail.","The waist hits super high, making these easy to pair with a tucked in or loose top."
"work","SO COMFY.","GORGEOUS.","FLATTERING.","I WISH I COULD AFFORD TO BUY THEM!","!"
"work","I love this blazer.","It is so cute and the perfect addition to any outfit."
"work","The fabric, the color, the fit - everything about this dress is fantastic.","I wore this to work then to meet friends for dinner and drinks - and it worked great for both events."
"work","Very flattering.","I order up a size because Im usually in between and Id never worn DVF before.","I probably wouldve gone with the 4 if I were to order again which is what I normally wear."
"work","Great dress to wear to work, or would be perfect for a holiday party.","I loved the ruffle details on the arms and bottom of the dress.","The dress is more burgundy in color vs. a true red as it appears in the item shot.","The arms are a bit constricting, so best to have someone to help you in and out of the dress.","Also, wouldnt recommend for an event where you need to be raising your arms.","Overall, great dress!"
"work","Liked this to try once during my Unlimited membership for work.","Zipper gets caught or stuck or something right where the bottoms meet the top.","With the buttons, this made going to the bathroom a bit of a production but otherwise great"
"work","a little short for a 58 frame but a great style"
"work","love this look.","almost killed myself on the stairs tripping over the flounce but I rocked it anyway.","I like this style because I have super long legs, so the length is forgiving.","its super high waisted... and Im super short waisted so thats something to consider."
"work","Was a bit long on me but Im short.","Enjoyed wearing this to work otherwise"
"work","If you are busty, this will show a lot of cleavage and breast-top."
"work","Tough to wear for big chested girls.","Otherwise very lovely"
"work","The dress feels a bit like wearing a tent, but a luxury tent with nice fabric and beautiful print.","Dress was good at hiding my gut, (or wine pouf as I like to say).","The design was really great and it was perfect for work and a design networking event.","I wore a jean jacket over it to try to give it more shape."
"work","The material was light but still formal enough for work and high quality.","The waist was fitted, but not overly so, and the chest/arm area fit comfortably.","I was worried that the tie around the neck would be too much or too difficult to wear properly, but it laid flat all day and I didnt have to fuss too much with it when tying."
"work","I loved this dress, it was bright and springy and completely lit up, my usual dark and dreary colored govt office!"
"work","this was a thick high quality knit dress that looked and felt expensive.","it looks more white and black online, but its actually a light tan and black.","it looked good on and fit just right.","perfect."
"work","Loved this dress!","It fit perfectly up top and was loose in the right places around my hips.","It does cinch up when I sit - so be cautious!","But a great, light dress - Ill rent it again."
"work","I wore this to a team outing with my client.","As a manager I wanted to go with a look that was fun but still had a slight feeling of professionalism.","This dress was PERFECT for that and I loved the sleeves.","The fit was also how I expected it to be and it fit great on me.","Id highly recommend this dress as its a great option that can be dressed up or dressed down depending the occasion.","The color is also a lot more red than it is orange.","Not a big difference but thought Id note that this isnt a completely orange dress - more red orange in case thats a consideration."
"work","Im usually a size 4 but I went with the 6.","It was still tight on the chest, but definitely still worth it!","I would rent it again"
"work","This dress is the perfect mix of fitted & flirty while also polished, professional & perfectly proportioned.","DVF should have been granted a Nobel prize for this design!!!!","Perfect for ANY occasion!!!!","I REALLLLY want to keep it!!!","!"
"work","This dress was simple, yet elegant.","Perfect for work.","It was comfortable  and classy, it could be dressed up or down."
"work","Comfortable, extremely well made.","Shorter length and a statement necklace saved it from being matronly.","I didnt have any trouble with the sleeves as others mentioned.","Wore with nude shoes.","Loved it!"
"work","True to size.","Very comfy."
"work","Thick fabric, cool block coloring; overall a great rental.","The sleeves started getting a bit itchy throughout the day, around my forearms... and the arms were very tight, so that was a little uncomfortable.","But the dress fits like a glove and is a little stretchy/forgiving."
"work","This is a double-take kind of dress.","The length and styling dont give its secret weapon away: a front and back center slit that shows off your legs with every step.","Im already a huge sucker for safari-styling, but when I saw how great this dress looked with high heels, I was sold.","This is a classic work dress that I would also wear for an evening out or a nice brunch.","It runs large but not bulky, and the only weird thing is the back bib which Im pretty convinced I wore wrong, but I loved the dress so much, I didnt care."
"work","This was part of my first RTR Unlimited order.","I did like this dress.","Only the 10 was available and it was a little large but it worked!","I got lots of compliments from my coworkers.","This dress is surprisingly heavier material than it looks, so beware if wearing this in July or August!"
"work","I rented this for everyday work, hoping to pair it with boots or flats as the season changes.","The fabric was VERY thin so it was not appropriate to wear until summer.","Maybe Ill give it another shot in July..."
"work","This style was a perfect fit but was still snug in the waist area, so I recommend sizing up in your back up!","The fabric has stretch and is very flattering.","Overall this style was form fitting but comfortable and the red color was the perfect pop in a sea of navy and black dresses.","I highly recommend this style for the next time you need to dress up, but still want to look conservative.","If you have a larger bust, I recommend sizing up in your back up because even though this style did have stretch, you may be more comfortable with a larger size."
"work","Loved this dress.","Silky fabric that felt and looked quality.","The color was a perfect Raspberry/ Wine color.","I tried to buy it, but could not find it anywhere.","I really wanted to add this piece to my normal rotation."
"work","This dress feels like a throwback.","Heavy material, so it would be great during the colder months with a sweater or jacket, as well."
"work","The reviews are pretty accurate.","This is a great dress.","It has a sturdy zipper and the sleeves can be a little snug if you have muscular arms like I do.","I didnt find them itchy, though.","When you look in the mirror it doesnt look like anything special but it photographs beautifully.","Its pretty tough to wear it in the summer as the material is a little thicker.","Itd make for a great fall dress with black stockings and boots.","Great rental!"
"work","This dress could not be more comfortable.","Lots of compliments and easy to wear."
"work","Great dress for work.","Was a nice material, a tasteful length for work, and had a bold design element with the cutout.","I loved that my bra never poked out from the cutout.","Was easy to wear and I felt confident in it.","That being said, this is not a bold look like other dresses, its simple and cute."
"work","Im obsessed with this dress and I wish I could keep it.","So flattering.","Tons of compliments.","I got it for a day at work where we had a big event after.","Perfect transition dress - work appropriate, but very fun.","I will definitely rent again."
"work","I paired this top with a black short sleeve ribbed sweater.","The dress was very comfortable and perfect for the office"
"work","Has the appearance of a separate sweater and skirt but the fact that its one makes it even more comfortable.","Got lots of compliments the day I wore it!"
"work","Got this with my Unlimited Subscription and wore to work.","It was super cute and comfortable.","It was a little big on me so the belt was appreciated.","I would rent this dress again a size smaller."
"work","The color is different the the picture; darker and not as vibrant.","It is also heavy.","With that said I received lots of compliments."
"work","Great fit, beautiful pattern and fabric.","Comfortable."
"work"," Did require a slip and attention to keeping the skirt closed and needed a cami.","But overall I loved both the fit and the feel.","Many compliments received !"
