"10.0","Loved it!","So flattering and fun.","Perfect for NYE"
"10.0","I wore this to an election night party, which was, of course, devastating.","Nothing--not even a lovely silk floral dress--could mitigate the shock, fear, and sadness of watching Trump gain momentum and eventually win.","That said, I really like the dress."
"10.0","Wore this for a black tie optional wedding.","I received so many compliments on it; it was very elegant with a little edge to it with the color.","The color is more of a lime green vs. a marigold I was expecting.","Did not need any accessories as the dress spoke for itself.","Fit is true to size.","Need to wear a strapless bra (otherwise straps will be visible)."
"10.0","This dress is so flattering to hide a bump in front, but still fits well on the sides with a slimming silhouette.","The sequins add a fun flair for holidays without being too flashy.","The length was perfect, not too short or too long.","I am 56 and wore with black tights and red heels for a pop of color."
"10.0","Fits true to size.","I loved the weight of the dress, how gorgeous the fabric was and it had POCKETS!!","Love it."

"10.0","I LOVED this dress!","Even though it runs small and was just a little too small for me, it was still comfortable!","Only a little bit of scratching under the arms from the sequins, it wasnt even noticeable once the event began!","Definitely get the next size up as your second size.","I had to pull it up a little to sit down comfortably, but again I think that was just because the size I wore was a little small.","Highly recommend this dress!","(I used my sisters account so the body info isnt mine, my info- 55, 38B, 145 lbs)"
"10.0","They styled this in a photo with a long-ish black dress, but its definitely a sexier look if you want it to be.","The lining and leather itself are so soft.","Even from a distance its clearly a high dollar piece.","The color (like everyone has said) is incredible.","I selected this to wear with a black sequined Badgley Mischka jumpsuit.","Im 51 and the sleeves on the XL were surprisingly not horribly long on me.","Size up one size if youre in between or if you have broad shoulders.","Will definitely rent again if its still around this fall, and possibly even purchase if it gets cheap enough on clearance."
"10.0","Fit is very comfortable; fabric is beautiful and bright!"
"10.0","Professional look, sexy and conservative.","Great for court appearances and great substitute for a suit.","Fits well..  its not too tight and allows room for normal people who doesnt have a flat belly.","Dress is forgiving for a person with a little belly..."
"10.0","The dress fit well, and was actually long enough for me (57 with 4 heels on).","I thought there were minor signs of wear, but thats to be expected to some degree."
"10.0","Edgy, yet classy.","The mix of navy blue and black will match almost everything.","The XS fit me, but did not give off that slouchy look as shown on the model.","If you want to achieve this look Id definitely recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes.","The material is super soft and has stretch, so its an easy fit.","Great for a cooler evening and can be dressed up or down."
"10.0","This dress is beautiful!","I usually wear a size 10 or 12 in dresses but I have a large chest (38DD).","I read the reviews and ordered up to a size 16 and it fit perfectly!","I received a ton of compliments and felt so comfortable all night.","The zipper was tough to work with at first but using the soap bar trick helped a lot.","I will say the dress runs long..","I am 510 and wore a 2 inch heal and still had the dress on the ground."
"10.0","In love with this casual off the shoulder Elizabeth and James dress.","Typically Elizabeth and James dresses run small, but this dress runs surprisingly large.","There is comfortable room throughout the bust and midsection, therefore I recommend sizing down for backup.","With bare shoulders, a strapless bra is a necessity.","At 58this dress hits about mid-thigh on me.","It is important to notice that the hemline is shorter on the sides, giving it a fun daytime party feel.","The eyelet detail is beautiful.","Pair with some brown lace up gladiator sandals for an edgy bohemian look!"
"10.0","This dress really was perfect for the wedding I just went to in NYC.","I got a ton of compliments, especially on the color... my boyfriend loved it and someone even noted that it was made for me.","Im a petite person and can range in dress sizes from OO to 2, Petite/Short and Regular.","My frame is small but my lower body is a little thicker and I am athletic, which makes ordering online a little challenging.","I ordered a size 0 and a 2 and went with the 0 because it fit better around my bust (32A).","I ended wearing a padded push up bra, too, which helped fill it out as well.","Overall I would absolutely wear this dress again... in fact I just ordered another Shoshanna lace dress in black for a rehearsal dinner in October.","Love RTR!"
"10.0","I rented this dress for a black tie family wedding.","It was comfortable and form fitting, and just the right length for me.","Im just under 54, I usually have to buy long dresses in the petite section or have my dresses hemmed  but this dress was a great length on me, most likely because it rode up a little due to my curves.","The fabric is breathable with just the right amount of stretch to hug your curves.","I do have a little belly and it was visible in the dress, but I still loved the dress and think that i looked tasteful.","I also didnt have to wear a bra, even though im a 38DD i hate wearing them, with this dress so it was so easy to wear and very comfortable!"

"10.0","I usually wear a 2-4.","The 4 wasnt too much larger than the 2 on the torso and chest but was longer and had a bit more material at the legs.","I chose the 2 so it was more form fitting.","I debated on getting the 2long which would have been good with heels (i dont like my shoes to show) but would have been too long in back with the small train for this event because it was outside."
"10.0","It fit beautifully.","The arms were a little long but they folded to roll up nicely.","Fabric is soft and movement was easy."
"10.0","Fit like a glove.","The back is gorgeous!","I received so many compliments!","Love RTR!"
"10.0","Such a chic See by Chloe dress!","At the same time that this navy dress is perfect for an elevated look, it can also be worn very casually.","Isn’t that amazing!?","It can be worn to work, or to a more formal event such as a dinner, or even day to day.","I paired it with some white sneakers for a casual look, but it can easily be paired with sandals, flats, heels, or boots in the winter.","There is a loose tie in the front that be worn as a bow like shown in the model or loosely with only a knot to give your look an extra charm.","I loved the details on the cuff of the sleeves.","Super elegant!","The material is somewhat stretchy which is great to fit all body shapes.","It can easily be worn by women with fuller busts and hips.","Running true to size, though, I would recommend sizing up for back up.","Prepare yourself to be compliments by everyone around you!"
"10.0","GORGEOUS - the colors and fabric were a perfect match for the Caribbean setting.","The dress is fitted through the waist, but very comfortable and easy to move in.","The 6R is a bit long - I wore embellished flat sandals instead of heels.","Not really a problem, but I did have to be careful with stairs (and the dance floor)."
"10.0","I rented this dress for a birthday night out with my husband, and it has easily become my favorite rental dress so far.","I ended up wearing the XSR, and it fit as expected.","The neck was tight, but if Id gone up a size, the underarm section would have been too big.","The tea length was surprisingly flattering, or at least not unflattering.","Such a length normally accentuates a short persons shortness, but this dress avoids it by the draped, uneven hemline.","I felt amazing in this dress, and I received a number of compliments.","Highly recommended!"
"10.0","Awesome dress, very comfortable.","Im 52, 125 lbs and it fit perfectly!","Wasnt too tight, where you still felt like you could eat and not be bulging out of it."
"10.0","Classic style, interesting fabric.","Snug fit, but comfortable.","Great length.","Sparkly without being too much and doesnt leave a trail of glitter when you hug people, sit, or brush against walls.","The slit in the back was kind of high.","Totally fine for me, but surprising nonetheless.","Would 100% recommend with a good pair of Spanx!"
"10.0","Love this top - the ruffles are just too cute.","Probably not best for a pear shaped figure since the ruffles make you seem a bit larger around the mid section."
"10.0","Amazing fit, slimming in the waist.","Thick material.","Highly recommend!"
"10.0","Just tight enough on the chest -- sexy but still work appropriate."
"10.0","I was afraid to try a romper, so glad I did.","Its not sloppy and I get complements non-stop.","Get it!"
"10.0","Was a perfect look to speak at a conference.","I paired it with a white blazer and it was a brilliant show stopper.","I was nervous renting it but it was even better in person and hides tummy fat ;)"
"10.0","I was able to wear a razor back bra which was a win in my book!","I usually wear a size 4 but the 2 in this dress fit perfect.","The length worked out well for my height.","I wore heals but it would probably have worked with flats as well."
"10.0","Im more of a pear shape so the higher waist allowed me to wear a 10; I would have been curious to see how the 8 fit.","I am normally a size 12.","It was extremely comfortable with light fabric which was great since it was so hot!","The pockets are amazing and deep!","Im 54 and wore 2-2 1/2 inch heels and it barely hit the floor.","I wish I could buy this dress it is that amazing!"
"10.0","I am 57 and I got the long, I would have been okay with the regular length, but I always wear tall shoes.","Some of the reviewers said they were glad they ordered the long, and I probably would have been okay with the regular length, but the long fell right at the right place with my 5.5 inch heels.","I got several compliments on the dress and thought it was very flattering on my figure.","It definitely accentuates your butt, so if that is something you want to draw attention to, this is a great dress."
"10.0","It was stretchy-ish, so I sized down so it looked more of a tight fitting dress.","I was definitely the best dressed at the party."
"10.0","I got so many compliments on this dress!","It fit me very well and was comfortable for sitting and for dancing.","I wore a stick-on backless bra with it, which worked well, since a regular bra would show.","My only complaint is that the little sleeves seemed to be stretched out somehow so that they werent as fitted as I would have liked."
"10.0","The dress was beautiful for a late summer wedding.","After some time in the sun the blue complimented my tan nicely.","The neckline was great because it was unique and it was flattering for your arms.","The length made it easy to pull off heels, and the asymmetrical hem also added an additional unique flare.","Definitely not your typical dress!","As for the fit...","Many people mentioned it ran small.","I wore my regular size and felt comfortable.","I did add some spanx underneath, but only to smooth over the outline of my belly button (which they did)."
"10.0","This dress doesnt have any stretch, but it fits exactly to size.","The texture of the leather is amazing, and the dress hung really well.","It is quite heavy, though, as you would expect from leather, and almost feels like an apron for a minute when you put it on, but you get used to it quickly.","The inside is very soft, so its wearable without a bra.","I got tons of compliments and would definitely rent it again!"
"10.0","It fit like a glove!","It wasnt too tight or too long.","It was perfect!"
"10.0","I loved this style and the unique feather detailing!","The dress runs true to size however I would recommend sizing up for the backup size.","An important thing to note is that these are two separate pieces.","For larger busts I recommend sizing up due to the fit of the top!"
"10.0","im not sure why i ordered a 12 but these were big, and very long - but they still looked great.","the waist is elastic so id size down if you are on the fence.","im 57 w/ long legs and i still had to wear my tallest heels to keep these from dragging on the floor.","they are so cute though and i got loads of compliments.","i would definitely order again."
"10.0","5 stars for the product itself.","Thicker fabric may be too much for summer (90 degrees today where I am).","This seems to be more of a fall shirt due to the heftiness of the fabric.","Otherwise, I love the colors, print, fit, and overall look.","Super versatile with black and navy blue in the print (piping at neck is navy, though).","My other issue which may keep me from actually wearing it (sadly) is that it came with a very strong dry cleaning chemical smell.","Some fabrics will retain chemicals and smells more than others.","This might be one which does."
"10.0","52, 128, 34C-26-36 hugs curves perfectly.","Great if your stomach is flat, if not choose another dress but if so you will love it!"
"10.0","As with other Halston dresses Ive rented, the 4 fit me perfectly.","I loved the cut of this dress, and received many compliments on it.","The fabric is shimmery without being too sparkly.","I wore this for NYE, but would definitely wear it to an event, wedding, etc.","Loved this rental!"
"10.0","I felt like a rockstar in this dress!","It is perfect for a very formal black tie event.","I felt glamorous and incredibly comfortable.","Ive never been to a black tie event and decided to take a risk with an asymmetrical dress.","I have 32DDs so anything that requires a strapless bra scares me because my ladies end up saggy.","My torso is a little short, so that definitely is no good.","Im almost an hourglass (I think my waist has to be a tiny bit smaller to be a true hourglass?).","I also generally dont go asymmetrical because I think Im just boring and scared of new things.","I am sooooo glad I went for this piece!","The strapless bra worked out fine and the cut divided my body in a flattering way.","The curtain effect on the lower half was awesome.","The material is fairly thick.","I know this sounds bad, but almost like drapes.","That being said, it works and is incredibly comfortable.","I wore it in April in LA in the evening, and it was perfect.","It might be too hot for a summer event.","Im short so I wore a higher heel and it didnt drag on the ground.","Also, make sure you wear a shoe that is open across the ankle.","Make those legs look long!"
"10.0","I just HAD to rent this gorgeous jumpsuit .",".",".","one, for the color .",".",".","two, because when do you ever get to wear a jumpsuit!","All eyes were definitely on me and the bride herself came over to tell me girl, youre killin IT in that jumpsuit!","I would recommend this to any girl ready and willing to take a chance on trying something new."
"10.0","Dress runs true to size, looks great once its on.","The colors are lovely in person.","If you are tall-ish (57 and up), make sure you get the Long.","I would have been going barefoot had I not ordered the long, which enabled me to wear heels.","Dress is slightly tight around neck but youll get used to it after a few minutes of wear.","Would love to own this dress, it really is great."
"10.0","Loved this dress!","Its a nice heavy knit which was great for winter.","I wore this to a work event over a black tank top, and even though it minimized the effect of the lace, it still had a lot of great detail and texture.","The long sleeves were nice and a simple wrap dress is so easy and flattering.","This ones a slam dunk."
"10.0","Loved everything about this dress.","It was classy for a church wedding, interesting/visual appeal of the lace and neckline, great color, and flattering cut with room for a dinner belly.","It was easy to dance in, extremely flattering to all areas (esp.","to highlight the booty!)","and was different than any other dress at the wedding!","Loved this dress so much and was very sad to send it back!"
"10.0","warning for girls with larger midsections!","im typically btwn a 2 and 4, usually a 2 in halston, but i have a large waist and found the 4 to look a bit tighter than i wld like.","also, i have a bit of fat on my lower belly and it was very much on display.","i loved the length and the color the top and back was stunning.","i am hoping to try the 6 on to see if it looks better.","hem went past my knee, but i didnt mind because i was planning to wear high heels"
"10.0","This jumpsuit boasts a rich plum color that is perfect for fall and winter!","The size XSR had comfortable room in the bust, waist, and hips.","I am typically a size 2 and loved the fit of the XSR, but it does seem to run slightly large.","There is a fastener at the neckline that you can close or leave open to show some skin.","Wear to work, brunch, or to drinks with friends and pair with minimal jewelry."
"10.0","I wore this to my friends rehearsal dinner and received so many compliments.","The shape is very flattering - simple and classic.","It is not fitted at the waist, and the V neck is fairly deep.","The medium was a little short on me, but the large was too big (and low cut).","Overall the dress was easy and comfortable, I wish I could own it!"
"10.0","Wore the dress to by boyfriend black tie holiday party.","The dress fit great and looked amazing."
"10.0","This dress is super sexy and form fitting.","The material is really thick and well-made and it has a ton of stretch, so when you get it, it looks way too small but it will stretch out to pull on over your head.","It sucks you in incredibly tight and stayed put all through dinner and dancing.","The web pattern on the dress is incredibly flattering, creating the illusion of a smaller waist, the cut is perfect, and its not too short.","The nude paneling under the dress gives the illusion of being revealing while providing complete coverage.","I got this to wear for a bachelorette party and the bride-to-be loved it so much I let her wear it instead!","I would 100 percent buy this dress and wear it every chance I got if I could!"
"10.0","Best part of this dress is how comfortable, lightweight and fun it is.","The color is bright red, so perfect its for a summer wedding.","The dress does run on the larger side.","I normally wear size small or medium and the XS was still big on me.","Loved that though so I was able to eat, drink & dance without feeling uncomfortable (and was able to stay cool in the hot summer heat).","Highly recommend if youre looking a looser-fitting dress!"
"10.0","The fit was wonderful!","!"
"10.0","This is a great dress for work.","The fabric is on the heavier side (in a good way, not flimsy).","The sleeve ties are a bit bulky; you wont be able to wear a blazer or a slim cardigan over it (or even a slim coat).","I would rent it again."
"10.0","I could have used the 0P or 2P, but wore the 0R based on availability.","The bust was tight only when kneeling down (to wrangle my daughter)  Otherwise, this dress was a stunning choice.","I wore 3.5in heels and there was about 1/2 in of fabric sweeping the ground.","It wasnt terrible, but I sized down to minimize the sweeping.","I wore a strapless bra and never had to adjust the bust area.","It was a secure, snug fit without being annoying.","The color of the dress is gorgeous and I loved every minute I wore it."
"10.0","this dress has made me love and become interested in the mara hoffman label.","it is beautiful, chic, light weight, and comfy.","it did run large, belting it is recommended.","i live in fl, so i appreciated the airy feel of this loose fitting dress.","i loved the tropical print too :) very sad to return, id love to own it!"
"10.0","This romper is super cute!","It is a little short (Im only 53), but with a darker pair of tights/nylons, its not too short and I was easily able to dance all night without feeling restricted.","The fit was perfect with the size 4 (120 lbs, 34C) and the sleeves were not tight (I have an athletic build with muscular arms).","I also dressed it up with a skinny black belt to emphasize the waist area."

"10.0","Loved the fit of this dress, and the gorgeous back.","Received compliments all night!","I ended up wearing a sticky backless bra with it, which wasnt ideal, but it was sort of loose on top for my smaller chest without a bra.","Definitely rent if you have the chance!"
"10.0","I got lots of compliments on this dress!","I loved the fit, and the fact that I could wear a simple strapless bra.","It was actually my backup style, but I ended up going with it (over the floor-length, fitted gown), and Im glad I did.","It was a fun, festive dress, comfortable dress, and perfect for dancing.","I found that it ran true to size."
"10.0","I wore this to a shower - ended up wearing the large because the button at the bust of the medium did not want to stay when I sat up straight.","The pattern on this dress is so vibrant in real life, the photos do not do it justice!","It was extremely comfortable for the event and I was sad to put it in the mail the following day.","Real winner!"

"10.0","A bit scratchy and should have worn spanx- pretty tight in the hips.","Looked great and expensive in person!"

"10.0","This dress was so comfortable.","I normally wear a size 18 and the 18WR fit perfectly.","As other reviewers have stated, the dress was on the low cut side but a safety pin quickly fixed that problem.","While you can wear a regular bra, you do need to be a little bit careful though, I ended up trying on about 4 until I found one that you couldnt see in the front (I did opt to still have the dress be a little on the low cut side).","I did have to have friends keep tucking in the back of my bra or pulling up the back of the dress the whole night (a safety pin would have done the trick, but I didnt have anymore).","The zipper was a little difficult to zip up over the areas that had more material, but it wasnt anything impossible.","The dress was surprisingly short; Im 53 and it barely grazed the ground when I wore it.","No complaints from me though, it gave me an excuse to wear flats and be comfortable for the whole night!","Overall I adored this dress.","I honestly dont know if Ive ever gotten so many compliments in one night.","Law school prom was definitely a success thanks to this dress and Rent The Runway!"

"10.0","Casual and comfortable, this dress is a fun material and the pattern is beautiful."
"10.0","This dress is super comfortable but definitely runs on the smaller side.","Im between 58 and 59 and (against my better judgment) went with the regular instead of the long.","The regular was the perfect floor-length...if I didnt wear any shoes.","With heels it ended up being too short so I would definitely recommend that if youre on the taller side to order the long instead of the regular.","The 2R was a little snug on me but the 4R was too loose so I went with the 2R.","Overall its a great dress and I received a ton of compliments on it!"
"10.0","This dress was so cute and so comfortable!","It was fun and girly, especially because of the cute little bow!","Definitely beware that the entire front of this dress is see-through though!","Youll need to have something prepared to wear underneath.","This dress was very stretch, so it worked out with a full bust, but I do think it would work best for a smaller chest, in my opinion!","Its super pretty and very versatile, especially because you can choose how much coverage you want there to be."
"10.0","Please excuse the mirror pic!","I unfortunately had to return this gown because the event I rented it for got canceled.","However, that didnt stop me from trying it on :) I normally wear a 2, but the 0R fit like a glove.","I could imagine needing to pull the gown up every so often to adjust, but not to the point where it would be bothersome.","I loved how slimming this dress was.","NOTE: The dress is fairly long.","Wearing anything but 4 inch heels is not an option if youre around 5 4 like me.","Overall, this gown was stunning, and I plan to rent it again for my next formal event."
"10.0","Beautiful color.","Comfortable.","Flattering on any body shape.","Zipper in the back required a little tug.","Runs slightly big so order a smaller size as back-up.","Runs very long so order the regular length.","Im 5 9 and usually wear size 8.","With this dress I wore the 6L and dress was still quite long with 4 heels.","Received lots of compliments.","Thanks RTR!"

"10.0","The slight train on back of dress makes the look!","Otherwise, simple and sophisticated.","Cut is very flattering for hourglass figure.","I choose a very conservative look with pearl necklace but I see why many choose a statement necklace.","The high neckline and long sleeves could  come across as boring.","Warm choice for fall or winter event.","Kim kardashian wore this look in white.","You can google the look to see how she accessorized."
"10.0","Fun dress, I got tons of complements.","It didnt photograph as well as I had hoped but looked awesome in person!"

"10.0","Wore this for my Bachlorette and it was amazing!","I was hesitant to order it because I wasnt sure if this style would agree with my figure but I was wrong!","I have a long torso with an hourglass figure and this dress made me feel sexy.","It made my waist seem tiny and the hem was perfect for making my legs longer than they are (with the help of blue high heels).","This dress is perfect for a bachelorette if you want to go for a sexy but classy look."
"10.0","I wore this dress to an art auction / cocktail party.","It was perfect.","Classy, yet intriguing.","I got many compliments.","Not only that, but it was very comfortable.","The fabric is nice and the dress is well-made."
"10.0","Excellent fit for my body type (read: no chest, little tummy, big thighs) that would likely flatter nearly most body types -- although I have no chest so the no bra thing worked well for me and may not for those with more curves.","I loved the fit and feel of this dress.","Paired it with tan heels and a black sweater."
"10.0","It was absolutely gorgeous & everyone complimented it all night.","It ran larger than I expected; I usually am a 2 or 4 in dresses (smaller in pants) and the 2 was a little large on me.","And for someone who is just under 56, I was surprised it was still - with heels - too long.","Other short ladies: I would suggest the petite."

"10.0","This is a great dress.","I was between getting the 0R and the 0L, but after taking a tape measurement of my height with heels on (tops of shoulders to floor), I decided to try the 0R.","I was worried it would be too short with 4 inch heels (I HATE when long dresses only come to my ankles when I wear heels), but the 0R dress just grazed the tops of my toes with heels on!","Perfect!","The dress fit my body extremely well, if not the tiniest bit roomy in the midsection(Im rather narrow through the torso), so I didnt even bother with the size 2.","There were a few picks of the delicate fabric on the bodice, but they were very small and not noticeable to others at all.","The dress has tons of fabric that swishes and sways with your movement, so I felt like a movie star walking around!","Just be sure to gather it before you walk up/down stairs, otherwise you may trip!!","This was a perfect pick for a formal occasion!!","The bride (who is pretty particular) said she loved my dress, too!"
"10.0","This is super-easy to wear and the print is gorgeous.","It fits loosely and the sleeves add a cool updated vibe.","I liked it a lot and wore it three times!"
"10.0","This was my first RTR rental.","I needed something to wear to my brothers wedding- a dress that was fashionable, but tasteful enough for a family gathering.","I loved this dress so much, my only regret is that I didnt get to keep it!","It was perfect for a family wedding but I could picture wearing it for so many other occasions...Vienna Opera House?","Gala?","Engagement pics?","I had been stalking the black version of this dress when I saw the blue color was added.","I chose to go with the blue, because I often wear black to formal events.","Also, from a practical perspective, since it was newly added, I figured the blue dresses would have less wear and tear.","One of the sizes I received actually still had the tags on it!","I am on the shorter side, so I was worried the length might be an issue for me, but it worked perfectly with heels.","The 0 actually fit very well, everywhere except the bust (it squished my chest.)","So, I went with the 2 which was more forgiving in the bust.","On a fun note- the dress had pockets."
"10.0","Lovely detail on the sleeves.","On the shorter side but conservative cut of neckline keeps it classy.","Looked great with heels and statement necklace."
"10.0","I wore the larger size (22W instead of 20W) for more room in the shoulders, bust and biceps.","Im a little heavy right now, so Id say this one runs true to size.","It felt a little young for me, Im 50, but my husband thought it was flattering and cute in a retro kind of way.","The fashionista-types at the restaurant seemed to appreciate it, which was nice.","The mesh over layer on this dress is of a thicker fabric than you might expect, which I liked.","It has an exposed metal zipper CB which seemed a bit heavy, but ok.","Overall this dress is really cute and I would recommend it for a special event."
"10.0","This gorgeous dress was so flattering and comfortable - I wore it to the Grammy Awards this winter in Los Angeles.","My RTR stylist in NYC, Neil was incredible and my first experience with RTR was awesome!","Im already back online ordering a dress for a wedding in a few weeks!","Thank you so much for making the dress finding process fun, easy, and painless again, RTR!!","You guys rock my socks!"
"2.0","While the dress fit amazingly, it was nothing like the picture.","The embellishments were much more sparkly then pictured and the dress was more of alternating strips of silver and blue instead of just a nice, metallic light blue color.","I did not end up wearing it to my event."
"2.0","The dress is beautiful.","However, it has a matronly look.","The deep V in front and back combined with the empire waist just looked matronly on my body type."
"2.0","I could not wear this dress and was very disappointed.","I am thin and normally wear a size 4 in dresses.","This dress was cut for someone with narrow shoulders and very thin arms.","I felt like it was just not cut for my body type."
"2.0","I cant believe how this looked on me!","It was truly awful!","I have petite shoulders and arms and when I tried this dress on the sleeves looked ridiculously overpowering.","The length is a little shorter than I expected.","It generally fit smaller than normal dresses of this size.","Such a shame I couldnt wear it because the color was beautiful."
"2.0","This dress is exactly what I was looking for in pictures but the minute I received it, I realized it was completely unflattering.","It makes anyone look wide.","You need to have a TINY waist in order for this to look decent and it has an extremely poufy skirt."
"2.0","I ordered both a 4 and 6 for this dress.","Unfortunately, UPS lost the package and RTR only had a 4 in stock.","I received the dress in time for the event but it was too small in the bust.","The size 6 probably would have fit me, which at the time, was probably true to size.","I do rate RTR customer service 5 stars, though!","They did their absolute best to get me the dress on time and were also timely in refunding me for the whole purchase when I contacted them about the replacement dress not fitting.","I will definitely try RTR again!"
"2.0","The top of the dress was very baggy, which is something I have never been able to say because I wear a FF cup.","The dress was too short, Im 5 5 and expected it to at least reach the floor, which it did not.","The zip was impossible to move up and down the dress, but was roomy enough that I could put it on over my head without a problem.","I expected the gold panels to be matte fabric, they are really embroidered flower details."
"2.0","This dress made me look about 10 lbs heavier than I actually am.","I have 57 and 155lbs with a pretty apple shaped body.","I hold my weight in my stomach, love handles and chest.","I was really disappointed that the dress didnt look good on me because it looked good on other girls in the pictures, but if you carry weight in your love handles/lower stomach/lower back this dress will make you look bigger than you are as the rouching sits right there."
"2.0","Couldnt wear this because of the poor quality.","The piling fabric made the dress look very worn.","I could see that this dress was very popular because of the poor quality."
"2.0","Couldnt wear it, needed nearly 3 more inches to zip."
"2.0","Overall, the dress was a bit frumpy and I opted to wear a different dress.","The chest area was baggy and going down a size would have made it too small in the waist.","I loved the color and the back but the overall style is better suited for someone older."
"2.0","The material and fitting of this dress are unforgiving.","It hugged and highlighted every single detail.","I liked the front a lot, but the back felt fabric heavy.","Definitely not for my body type; I couldnt wear it."
"2.0","So, I am usually a size 6 which was I was told a few days before the event was not available, so they went ahead and sent the backup size 4 to me.","It was too small.","But I tried it on and it was super long - even with a 4 heel it was dragging the ground in the 4R.","Also, it did not look as expensive as it does on the website.","My daughter said it looked like a Halloween costume.",":("
"2.0","Too tight around the middle and buttocks if you have any fat at all."
"2.0","Dress is pretty, but very short-waisted and did not work for my body type."
"2.0","It is a cute dress, however, I rented it for vacation and could not take it with me because the bust area was very tight and uncomfortable."
"2.0","This dress looked ridiculous!","it was way too short - Im 510 and it came to my ankles.","I seriously wonder if they shipped me the regular and not the long.","My friend who is 56 tried it on and it went to the floor with her but if she wore heels it would even be short!","Crazy!"
"2.0","This dress is good in theory however it did not work will for my body type.","Where the drawstring rests was extremely unflattering  if you have hips."
"2.0","It looked tacky in person, didnt fit well, and it had wires sticking out.","It was also very itchy and did not look appealing at all."
"2.0","Was not flattering and looked cheap"
"2.0","First upon arrival the hangers were broken and both sizes were insanely wrinkly.","The fit of the dress was just off.","Big up top and a small skirt.","As I carefully ironed the Med I noticed have a dozen tiny holes in the neckline from pins and a few stain spots.","Did this really get dry cleaned??","I thought to myself....I was out of town and didnt have a back up so I rolled with it.","Well the neckline definitely gaps and needs a pin.","The dress is super thin and wrinkles the moment I sit down.","The faux wrap was tough to position.","Pull it too tight and it hikes up the back skirt.","Knot it too loose and you arent doing the neckline any favors.","I should have trusted the prior reviews but I loved the color and pattern.","Also, very disappointed that the dressed was dirty when it arrived."
"2.0","This dress has a center pleat on the front of the skirt that is EXTREMELY unattractive.","It literally makes this dress look like a pretty maternity dress.","It also ran large.","The size 4 top was swimming on me, and I am a 32D strapless/32E regular bra.","If you dare rent this dress, get a smaller size than you ordinarily wear."
"2.0","This didnt work for winter weather.","Did not look good with tights"
"2.0","My boobs were too big, heavy material, maybe not for summer."
"2.0","I own many Tracy Reese dresses and this fit was WAY off.","I couldnt even zip the 12 in the bust, yet the waist and hips were big.","Very odd fitting.","Lovely fabric and great concept, but a total waste of time and money for me to rent.","I was going to wear this to an awards ceremony at my company but had to send both back.","Strange fitting garment.","What a shame."
"2.0","If you are over say, 57, do NOT get this dress.","It is SOOO short.","How disappointing and a total waste of money.","The drescription assured me that at 59 the long should work, but it absolutely did not."
"2.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress because the white part was very poofy and tutu-ish and made me look way wider below the waist."
"2.0","The leather was nice and it had a fleece liner that was very warm.","I did not love the bulky look of the jacket since it was soft it just wasnt my favorite."
"2.0","Paper thin fabric.","Only appropriate as a beach cover up."
"2.0","Fabric is gross and cheap.","Waist closure was awkward.","Yuck."
"2.0","I am 6 tall and rented the 8 and the 10.","The 8 fit my torso but as the photo shows the length was awful!","The 10 was too big but the length was the same.","It looked like a tunic top instead of a dress.","The dress is also a sweatshirt material.","Even if it hadnt been too short I wouldnt have worn this for a summer wedding.","Definitely a fall or winter wedding dress."
"2.0","Super tight.","I usually wear a 6 or 8.. this was an 8 and too small for me to even post a picture :).","Thought it would be a loose fit to wear to work but definitely not.","Really cute style and really light fabric -- just be cautious of what size you order."
"2.0","Its a cute dress, but itd be more flattering if it werent so wide and didnt have a drop waist.","A cross body purse helps it not look so big.","It did have several pulls in the silk, and a few spots."
"2.0","I received this item for a date.","I was unable to wear the top.","It was small across my bust; The bow became a hassle and fussy.","I did not get to wear the top."
"2.0","I rented this for a rehearsal dinner but it was way too short!","Im 58 and a size 4.","There was maybe two inches below my butt and if I bent over it looked too short.","It also didnt go with the look.","I would only recommend if you are less than 55!"
"2.0","Sadly I didnt get to wear this one, it was WAY to tight and wouldnt zip up.","I really wanted to be able to wear this one tho because it was so beautiful!"
"2.0","I am a solid 14/16, so unsure of which would fit best, ordered both.","I never even tried on the 16, but the 14 could have passed for probably an 18.","After getting zipped up I turned around and the dress was so big it fell right off.","I had to scramble in the middle of ohio to buy a new dress hours before the wedding, it was awful!"
"2.0","Cons - didnt fit me!",":("
"2.0","I wore a size smaller than I usually wear and it was still a little big.","Also I felt like it wasnt flattering- it seemed to puff out too much in the front where the pleats are.","My husband didnt find it very flattering on me either so it was a no go and I didnt even end up wearing it.","I was really disappointed."
"2.0","The dress was a great color and fit true to size.","However I didnt actually wear it because the dress was pilled and looked worn."
"2.0","This dress was too Overwhelming for me and had too much material."
"2.0","I did not like this dress at all.","The straps fit very wide, to the point where they barely fit over my shoulders, and I have broad shoulders.","It was very tight and not comfortable.","I did not understand how anyone could fit into this dress."
"2.0","There was only a size 10 available, and it was way too big.","I am usually a 6-8, and the 10 was like wearing an odd poncho.","There would have been no way to make the larger size look flattering.","Have no idea how a properly sized dress would look.","Luckily it was my backup."
"2.0","The dress was too big for me though I normally wear a medium.","Also the straps were waaaay to long and where the bust of the dress hit would have exposed my breasts without some adjustment.","Also the bottom of the dress is transparent, you can see EVERYTHING.","I received this dress as one option for my event and it will not be worn."
"2.0","Could not even get the dress over my hips, even tried to pull it over my head.","Really bummed as it was beautiful and the quality was incredible.","Wish I got one size up!","You cant see it in pictures but there is a belt that hinders your ability to put the dress on."
"2.0","I returned another dress that was five inches too short and exchanged it for this one.","The length was much better, but the size was too tight on my ribcage.","Returned it."
"2.0","The fabric is very stiff and heavy.","It was tight around my hips and does not stretch, when I walk it just bundles up into a stiff mess of fabric.","The cut outs at the burst makes it cup, it is not form fitting at all.","The dress is very boxy and doesnt compliment girls with hips.","I didnt wear this dress."
"2.0","The dress runs small.","I typically wear a 4 but Ive rented both 2s and 6s in the past depending on reviews of the item.","For this dress I wore a 6 and it was still really small.","The biggest issue with the dress was the material.","It was so thin and completely unexpected.","It hugged all of the wrong areas on me and generally the waistline hit at a really unflattering place.","I found the arms to be completely uncomfortable as well.","I just could not see myself wearing this anywhere.","I think it would look better on someone really short and small."
"2.0","This dress was impossible to get into and definitely should not be worn during the hot summer months.","i picked it out to wear in celebration of my fathers birthday and I ended up having to go buy something instead.","I couldnt even fit my arm into the sleeve, much less my body in the South Florida humidity."
"2.0","Didnt wear it."

"2.0","It was too tight.","It wasnt comfortable and Im short so it fit me sort of oddly."
"2.0","Didnt even wear it"
"2.0","This shirt is incredibly wide and strangely short.","The material is beautiful and it looks great on the model, but for me, it didn’t work.","One of the few RTR items that has been a miss!"
"2.0","I was swimming in this dress in a size 2.","The material didnt have spandex in it so it didnt fit nicely.","I would recommend sizing down 2 sizes, I think the size 0 would have been a better fit."
"2.0","Very large - would not rec for someone that is petite"
"2.0","I wore this for a winter ball and I absolutely hated it.","I ordered the 2L and 4L (Im 58 and I wore 4 inch heels) and the dress was too short.","It was almost perfect length when I was barefoot.","Since I have more of an athletic build, and not an hourglass, this dress did not hit me in the right places.","I tried to get on rtr to find a back up dress but they were all rented out.","Its a very classy dress but not flattering at all."
"2.0","The arm holes for this top were way too large - any way I turned you could see something you shouldnt have.","The stiff material was anything but comfy, but I could have dealt with it.","The color was blah and seemed to wash me out completely."
"2.0","This dress did not fit my body type well.","The fit in the shoulders for me was much too large, even with a push up bra on.","I returned this dress and did not wear it - the material was much heavier than I expected and it didnt sit well on my hips."
"2.0","I love RTR but this dress was the most uncomfortable dress I have ever worn.","Rented for valentines day dinner and had to leave my coat on the entire time because I was so itchy.","Would never rent this dress again even if it was free"
"2.0","If you are debating between sizes, definitely size down because it is very long and large; I am usually a small in elizabeth & james but I could have used an XS.","This sweater was just OK - unless you wear your hair up, you cant see the asymmetrical neck (which is pretty understated) and the fabric is a wool blend, which felt a little itchy."
"2.0","This piece has tremendous potential, but it was way too big for my body and was not at all true to size.","The front hung off of me and therefore was unflattering.","Ive had success with rompers in the past, so Im not sure why this one didnt work for me.","It is beautiful on the hanger and Im sure will look wonderful on curvier body types!"
"2.0","The dress seemed to run really large and I was unable to wear it because the straps were too long and the dress sagged way too low.","Also, it is much longer in the back (almost has a train) which is cool but didnt work for me since Im only 55"
"2.0","Cons: the underarm is worn out."
"2.0","I had to return this dress because it was WAY too short.","Its a beautiful fabric, but if you dont mind a short dress than this is the dress for you!"
"2.0","I wasnt wowed by this dress.","It served as a backup, and once I put it on, I didnt like the fit.","A little harsh fit for a curvier girl, like myself."
"2.0","The top is beautifully made, but it runs very big.","I ordered a small and it swollen me through the bust but was just right through the waist.","Would not recommend."
"2.0","This dress is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and I really wish I could have worn it for the wedding that I ordered it for, but the cut of the top part was not what I was expecting at all.","I have rented Slate & Willow dresses in the past and have fit perfectly into a size 2.","The top part of the dress is the issue because it almost cut in too much near the armpits.","The material and the cut of the bottom is just to die for, though!","If you have a smaller bust, this dress would probably fit perfectly."
"2.0","It was a cute shape, but the fabric was low quality and had pilling everywhere."
"2.0","I did not like that the top was not attached in any way, it kept sliding around and I was completely self conscious all day about the top not being in the right place.","Every time I went to lift my arm, I would need to readjust the entire thing.","I do not recommend this piece of clothing."
"2.0","It was very tight on the upper arms, I ended up not wearing it."
"2.0","The fit is extremely small from the length I am 52 and dress hardly covered my butt.","Could not zipper completely, material is very heavy.","Overall is awful !","!"
"2.0","Squished my breasts and very unflattering."
"2.0","I personally thought it ran shorter than the description.","I would go up a size if you have long legs are any hips at all.",":)"
"2.0","I am pretty flexible with sizes and can usually make something fit (add a belt, change the undergarments, wear spanx) however this ran ridiculously large and I couldnt wear it at all and had to send it back.","I might have worn it in another size but the color is a bit different from the model.","It is really a deep marigold and not a sunshine yellow.","It just depends what you are going for!"
"2.0","I sent this dress back without wearing it.","I tried styling it several ways - with tights and a jacket to bare legs and heels.","Nothing worked.","The fit was off for me.","The cut was all wrong and gave me a very lumpy, unattractive bell shape.","The fabric looks good on the bodice but the skirt detail is strange.","It looks worn and frayed but I think that is by design.","Good points: The dress has nicely placed pockets and the color is bright and bold."
"2.0","I was so excited to receive this dress.","I sized up based on other reviews, and it fit well everywhere except for the armpit hole.","This area was so tight that it was almost cutting off circulation to my arm.","This was the oddest experience Ive ever had with a one shoulder dress before.","I do NOT have thick arms either!"
"2.0","I rented a size 4 with a backup size 6; the 4 turned out to be too big all the way around.","The flowy layers on the top made me look wide, as well, although hard to say if I had the right size.","Im 52 and I also would have needed temporary hemming tape or something to get the look of the model.","Disappointed!"
"2.0","I am normally a size 2/4 but after reading the reviews decided to rent a size 4 with the free size 6 as an added extra.","DANG am I ever glad I did!","Even the size 6 was a struggle to zip.","And you cant wear even a strapless bra because the back will show.","I opted for pasties because the dress was so tight it acted as a compression garment.","Just like everyone else commented, when you sit down, the attached red lining hangs out.","For such a designer name, this dress was a complete disappointment!"
"2.0","I got this with my unlimited subscription and immediately sent it back.","The size was way too large (even for something that is supposed to be an oversized fit) and the whole thing was just way too bulky.","I thought this would be a good jacket for the mild winter were having up north, and to pack with me for Christmas down south, but it just takes up so much luggage space and is so huge for how little warmth it provides that it just doesnt make sense.","Also, the fabric is mostly synthetic and is very scratchy - doesnt feel good to wear at all."
"2.0","Free people is such a hit or miss for me.","I got a size 8....and it was  huge on me.","The straps were too loose and just didnt fit well at ALL.","Extremely disappointing."
"2.0","Not flattering at all to those with curves.","Adds 10lbs due to the larger waist (not fitted.)","I never wear spanx but bought a pair to try and they did not help.","Weird flair at bottom.","I think this would look good on a thin or straight body-type."
"2.0","Was so excited to try this dress on.","The dress fit great, however it was to short and I ordered the Long.","Didnt wear it to my event"
"2.0","I normally wear a size 4 or 6 in dresses, but based on all the reviews indicating this runs big, I ordered the 4.","Saying this runs big is an understatement!","I think even a size 2 would have been too big!","Recommend going down 1 or 2 sizes from the smallest size you would wear!"
"2.0","This dress was like wearing a corset on the top.","Very narrow- Im not sure how people with a large bust even wear this dress.","Im also 510 and I wear a 10/12, Large in normal dresses and this didnt fit!","I had to wear my backup dress to my event- not from Runway."
"2.0","I wanted to wear it for a winter wedding and it was just bad all a round.","The rouching didnt look right and I couldnt get over how thick the material was.","It felt a little like being wrapped in a velvet curtain at the movies.","Needless to say I did not wear it to the wedding."
"2.0","The blouse did not look good on me, the elastic on the sleeve was very stretched out.","I did not wear the garment"
"2.0","I ordered this dress as my main choice, and at the last second, threw in the Trina Turk Portrait of Elegance Shift as my backup, despite the fact that they appeared almost identical.","Boy am I glad I did!","The sleeves of the Davina dress were so tight and restricting I couldnt even lift my arms up past 90 degrees - hugging someone would have been out of the question.","I recommend the Trina Turk dress over this one."
"2.0","Im 59 and ordered a 6L.","It was really short on me, even without heels!","It was comical!","Do not rent if you are over 57"
"2.0","Didnt wear it.","too large and sloppy looking."
"2.0","Looks like it has been worn many times.","Fabric is shapeless and flimsy.","Gives major cameltoe.","I think this one needs to be retired.","Material is strange, very floppy.","Do not recommend."

"2.0","It was way too big and had an odd fit."
"2.0","I did not like the color of this dress, it is not accurately depicted in the photo.","Never wore."
"2.0","This dress did not appear in the picture as it was in person.","The front flap of the slit was much shorter than the rest of the dress (about 10 inches) and looked horrible.","It also pulled in funny ways even though it technically fit.","Dress was not flattering at all and I did not wear it for my event."
"2.0","I am typically a size 0 (56/123 pounds/34 D), but ordered a size two after reading reviews that this dress ran small.","I would have ordered the 4 as my back-up size, but it was unavailable.","I couldnt even come close to zipping the 2 - not only that, but the area around the neck could barely fit around my head and completely choked me.","I probably needed a size 6.","Unfortunately, I ordered this dress to wear to a wedding and had it shipped straight to my hotel, so I was left scrambling at the last minute.","I love RTR, but was disappointed/perplexed at how weird this dress fit."
"2.0","I love the RTR idea, this dress did not work for me though.","I am usually a size 10 but have a small bust.","The dress was very large in the bust area and i was pulling on it all night.","The bottom of the gown looked beautiful when I danced/walked, but the slit was not noticeable as it portrays in the picture.","I am renting another gown that has more stretch to it.","The band in the middle of the dress was tight and had no give.","It also made it hard to zipper."
"2.0","loved the color and style however at 54 this gown was way too long even with heels on.."
"2.0","So weirdly short.","Im 55 and it hit me 6inches above the ankle--not in the right place to be considered a midi...and definitely not a maxi."
"2.0","The dress did not fit.","The bodice straps were too long which caused the neckline to gap.","RTR sent me another style that also was not a good fit.","I wore something from my own closet.","The quality of the dress was wonderful.","I am disappointed that I was unable to wear either dress style."

"2.0","Runs really large.","Easy to wrinkle."
"2.0","It HUNG on me!","It was so large I was embarrassed.","I keep a 3/4 sleeve blazer jacket on the entire night.","I was very disappointed."
"2.0","This was sent to me as a backup (I didnt choose it).","Its a drop waist which isnt at all flattering if you have any sort of tummy.","But it was SO SMALL I couldnt even zip it up."
"4.0","I wear a size M in most things but this dress was massive and gapped open.","Would def size down."
"4.0","Older WomenStretchLarge"
"4.0","When I received this dress, I didnt realize that it was going to be wet suit material.","It was shapeless and ran very large.","The cute pleats fell flat and the dress had an overall frumpy appearance.","Generally, I love most of the items I receive and agree with other reviews, but Ive been renting for 2 years and this was definitely my worst pick."
"4.0","Normally the Badgley Mischka line has a lot of stretch to it.","This, sadly, did not.","If you have any boobs to speak of then this probably isnt the dress for you.","Granted Im a 36H but I still easily wear size Medium tops.","Because of the high waist and no give to the fabric, I literally looked like Id shoved a basketball down the front haha.","Fortunately, I got in touch with customer service and they over-nighted me another dress that was fantastic!"
"4.0","I rented this in both 8 and 10.","8 was far too small, 10 was huge.","Just didnt lay right on my body (curvy) I wonder if athletic build would be better.","Knockout for the lucky gal it fits."
"4.0","I knew the dress was low cut - but clearly underestimated HOW low - especially when you are sitting.","I had concerns all night that it was too much.","Also - seemed to run a little small - especially thru the hips and backside.","In addition, the sequins - while beautiful - rubbed under the arms and my husband actually cut his finger on them while zipping me up.","I was thrilled with my last RTR rental, but not this one"
"4.0","I am 5ft 6 in 125 lbs and this dress came to right above my ankle.","If you are 5ft 5 or taller I would rent the long."
"4.0","The color was beautiful but the sleeves are too long and wide.","They are not functional and looked awkward."
"4.0","My shape is very much hourglass.","This dress just wasnt a good fit for me."
"4.0","I was so sad when I pulled the dresses out...both sizes had some serious fraying of the lace edges, especially under the arms and along the back piece that hooks together.","They have obviously been worn a lot, and the number of reviews for this dress confirms that.","Luckily, they arrived two days early so I was able to contact RTR to get a different style shipped to me.","As for the fit, it was a little snug in the hips but not so snug that it didnt fit.","I wear between a 36 and 38 bra and the fit around my rib cage was also tight.","If you have a big rib cage/wear a large bra band size, consider sizing up.","Additionally, the long could have been a little longer (Im 57).","Flattering for a curvy body type though.."
"4.0","This dress was very beautiful in person, but the fit was WAY too tight.","I was not able to wear it because there was a piece of ribbon in the dress that cut into my side.","It did not look attractive at all!","I have a pear shape, not so much in the breast area so it was a little large there and VERY tight on my hips.","By the way, apologies for the ridiculous face, I was a little disappointed with the fit."
"4.0","This dress was very short (and I am only 50).","The slit was very deep on me and it continued to flap open.","I am a big fan of a shapeless dress... this dress had shape.","It was very wide at my hips and awkward around my thighs.","I really loved it, tried to make it work with leggings under or tight jeans but unfortunately I had to ship this dress back without wearing it."
"4.0","I normally love this look, but the fabric felt too casual for the style of dress.","There was way too much fabric on the collar - it really bunched up.","It just wasnt flattering at all on me."
"4.0","Between the polyester material and the unlined skirt, it felt and looked too much like a slinky nightgown to confidently wear for my boyfriends southern family wedding.","Undergarments (slip, spanx) were difficult because of the side cut outs and a friend commented that the skirt was a bit see-through.","The top had removable pads and you could easily go bra-free; the collar/bust line also had metal boning to hold it in place so no need for tape.","Straps were too long/loose on my shoulders though and non-adjustable.","Maybe its user error on my part, but the juice just wasnt worth the squeeze for me to figure out how to make this dress work."
"4.0","Im only 55 and this dress was very short on me.","Also flew up constantly with any tiny gust of air."
"4.0","Pros - comfortable, photographs well, was happy to send it back, no camel toeCons - super short, did not look elegant in person (looked cheap and not from a designer), would not rent it again, zero compliments compared to other runway outfits"
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress... and it fit perfectly in all areas... however, this dress was sooooooo short.","im 59 and it just looked absolutely ridiculous.","if you are short, you may have better luck than me."
"4.0","I love Mara Hoffman and the print is cute.","But you CANNOT get in and out of this dress by yourself.","There is a high neck button required to keep this closed in the back and it is basically impossible to remove on your own.","I also think it runs small.","Do not wear this somewhere where you will need to be going to the bathroom."
"4.0","The jumper ran small.","I am between a 6/8 and it wouldnt fit over my butt and thighs.","I had to wear something else to the party.","I usually love jumpers.","I think the large would be way to big in the top."
"4.0","Tight in arms and hips"
"4.0","The dress was very pretty.","I got a lot of compliments and it was unique.","It fit a little loose in the waist and was not as flattering as I had hoped.","I will rent again, but I sure hope the next time I call the company for help, I  am not on hold for over 10 minutes."
"4.0","I was so excited about this dress- loved the color and style, but unfortunately I could not wear this dress.","I am 58 with a full bust and very curvy.","All the reviews stated that it was true to size, but that was not the case for me.","I rented a size 16, which is my usual size in all clothing, including dresses, but I could not possibly zip up this dress.","It was really unfortunate because the dress is truly gorgeous and high quality."
"4.0","I loved the pattern on the dress and I should have known with a shift dress it wouldnt be a flattering fit; but on the model I thought it looked slightly tighter so you could at least see some curve.","I have more of an hourglass figure and shift dresses dont work well for me.","The sides of the dress didnt touch my body at all.","I ended up not wearing it."
"4.0","I wear a c cup bra this dress would not zip."
"4.0","I rented this dress along with another for a black tie charity event.","I am 20 weeks pregnant with bust 38DD, 59, and 160lbs at the moment.","I ordered a 12L and the length was good (1st picture).","This dress would have been perfect for my maternity belly because the material is super stretchy.","The straps, however, are too long and the bust area was a mess.","It just didnt look good on me.","I am glad I ordered a backup style (Slate & Willow: Signourney Gown, 2nd picture)."
"4.0","It was very short- if I lifted up my arms I could feel my tush almost want to come out the back.","Jersey laying underneath that was comfy."
"4.0","the dress cinched in a very awkward way, the way it folded over was not flattering on the tummy area"
"4.0","Fits true to size, but the stripes are almost pink, not crisp white, so if you wanted a red and white look, this probably isnt for you."
"4.0","runs very short and a tad to cleavage-y"
"4.0","its a nice dress but very wide on the bottom in an unflattering way.","also, im only 5 3, but it is to my knees"
"4.0","Great if over 55.","Not flattering on me At All.","Glad I brought my own backup dress for event."
"4.0","Terribly frumpy.","Was huge on me.","The color was awesome - but I really struggled to pair it.","With an item so bold, the fit has to be on point.","I returned it without wearing it."
"4.0","I couldnt wear this top because the sleeves were too tight on me.","The body was loose and flowy.","This top wont work well for anyone with arms that arent stick thin.","The fabric was really pretty, but there was also a red stain on the front of mine so I wouldnt have been able to wear it anyway."
"4.0","Really wanted to love this skirt and I did in photos, but when trying it on I found that it was not flattering at all.","It accentuated my hips and butt on my petite hourglass shape.","I had to return it without wearing unfortunately."
"4.0","I rented this dress for a formal Mardi Gras ball.","The 0 fit fine, but the Long length was really long on me.","Im 55 and was wearing 4 heels.","(I struggle with lengths on formals from RTR because Im kind of in between the regular and long and like to wear heels when I wear a formal gown.","The regular length is normally too short with heels.)","I felt like this particular dress the lace looked a little ragged and just didnt have that pizazz that I was wanting for a fun ball.","I felt too matronly in it and ended up wearing another dress I had rented."
"4.0","This dress just isnt flattering.","The shoulder pads are pretty large and the way that the waist is cut just didnt look good at all.","I ended up not even wearing it.","Also, its a pullover dress (not a zip-up) which I think makes the size of the dress run large."
"4.0","True to size fit with fitted bodice, but the flowy arms made the whole look boxy.","Very cute print but overall not my style nor was it flattering on me."
"4.0","Blazer fabric is not what I thought and perhaps I missed this in the reviews however the fabric has little pills all over it.","This seems to be intended and not due to excessive wear but it makes the blazer look worn.","The color is a yellower cream and again, makes this blazer look worn out.","fit was great but fabric really made this blazer unwearable as I did not want to look like I was wearing an old worn out blazer from the back of my closet."
"4.0","Table said 10R is equivalent to a size 6....no way!","Sending back not worn.","Will definitely try a bigger size when available.","Quality seemed great."
"4.0","I wanted to love this, but no no no.","The sleeves are insanely long...they cover up my hands completely.","I am a true size 4 and the torso area on this made me look like a sack...not a tailored waist like in the photo.","This went straight back to RTR."
"4.0","The dress runs large.","I ordered a size 0, my usual size, and a size 2 because I was afraid the fit was tight.","However, the fit is very loose especially in the bust area :( The positive side to it being so loose is that I was able to move around and dance all night ;)"
"4.0","Based on the reviews about the dress being long, I ordered a 2P.","The dress fit great.","I would give the dress itself a 5-star rating -- the color was beautiful and it flowed nicely.","However, I was very disappointed about the condition of the dress when it arrived.","There were bits of something white stuck to the bottom of the dress.","Based on how it looked, my guess was that the last person who rented it used glue to glue up the bottom a couple of inches to shorten the length.","Also, there were frays and small holes at the bottom from people stepping on the dress in the past.","It wasnt that noticeable from afar, but I was disappointed that the glue wasnt fixed in the dry cleaning process before it arrived and that the hem hadnt been fixed."
"4.0","Fit was fine, though  little tight under the arms.","Zipper was a b*tch for 2 people who helped me.","Worst part about this dress was it was totally misrepresented.","Had a great time at my event regardless, but felt very self-conscious.","Not all beading/sequins are created equal.Sorry to all of those who liked it, but I found it totally chintzy and child-like.","Would NOT recommend for any self-respecting adult.","Bummer."
"4.0","This ran way too large for my bottom and was too small for my top - it was a bit awkward - I didnt order it but RTR did give me a credit and offered to overnight me a replacement or ship me a smaller size unfortunately it wouldnt have worked smaller or larger."
"4.0","I wore this dress to a day after wedding brunch and I was very uncomfortable with the height of the slits.","I was very self-conscious about it and would not rent again."
"4.0","The material and the color is beautiful, but the pant legs were wider than I expected and it really looked like an outfit from the 70s (and not in a good way)."
"4.0","really cute dress, size up if you are between, the bust is not forgiving"
"4.0","Really pretty print - and sexy back - but the dress is REALLY short (and Im short!).","Wore with black tights so it wasnt totally inappropriate... but even then it was a little bit much."
"4.0","This dress did not fit me well, but even if it did, I would not have worn it as it is far more conservative than it looks in the photo.","I had been looking for something for a business event, so I was not turned away by the reviews, but this dress is better suited for a funeral than anything fun."
"4.0","I got the 12 and the 10 for back up.","First the bust was quite tight, no room here for anything larger than a full C. I was smooshed as a D. This isnt for the super tall - the waist was a little high and that peplum thing - it made me look like I had a gut, did not accent my shape at all.","It was a bit too plain for the business cocktail party I was planning for this."
"4.0","I unfortunately had to return the dress before the event.","It is a beautiful gown but it was way too long.","I am 59 and with heels, the long still dragged on the ground.","At least the return was very easy!","I appreciate the credit as well."
"4.0","Could not wear the dress.","I ordered for a bachelorette party in NOLA, and was unable to wear it because the waist was too large and bunched up every time I moved.","Over all the dress is beautiful and sexy, but it only looked good if I stood very still.","I have larger hips and bust, and it was fitted in those areas."
"4.0","Really liked the look online, just not a good fit for my body type.","Probably best on a tall, slender non-busty figure."
"4.0","This is a beautiful gown ...if it fits.","I was so excited to wear this to my friends formal wedding, but was unable to because the straps were way too long.","I dont have a short torso, but I do have a smaller frame (upper body) and I think this dress needs to be on someone who has pretty broad shoulders and/or no boobs.","I tried to shorten the straps by pinning them down, but it didnt work.","When I wore the straps the way that they were, most of my chest was showing.","I dont have large boobs or anything, I am pretty standard (34B/C), but without a bra, they were definitely showing."
"4.0","This shirt has very nice coloring and the buttons elevate the top.","Unfortunately there wasnt anything special about this item and looked a bit sloppy on."
"4.0","Dress was too big and honestly a little unattractive on with very little waistline."
"4.0","I ordered this dress for a holiday party.","The 2R  was extremely long and no amount of tape or super high heels could have made this dress workable.","For those who are short/petite, Id advise against this dress."
"4.0","Fabric good quality.","For some reason it runs very big."
"4.0","Seems cheap"
"4.0","I wanted to love this dress!","But, being 5 feet tall, it just wasnt the shape for me.","The cut at the chest is strange and made wearing a bra impossible.","Beautiful print though - if I was six inches taller, I think this would have been great!"
"4.0","The fit was extremely awkward, it was tight on the bottom and the shoulder par but loose everywhere in between.","I did not end up wearing the dress as it felt as if it had been stretched out only on the stomach part and did not flatter me at all.","I am unsure if it was the dress itself or if it has just been worn too many times.","I rent dresses often and this was the first one that was a huge disappointment."
"4.0","Dress was great and fit well everywhere but the chest.","I had to safety pin in close and that didnt work.","I ended up wrapping myself up in my shawl all night."
"4.0","Beautiful soft fabric.","Did not flatter my body type though."
"4.0","Seriously, size up with this dress.","I normally wear a 6 but the 6 didnt even come close to zipping on this one.","Sad, because the dress is gorgeous!"
"4.0","Runs small and is a bit short"
"4.0","I loved the picture, but not on me.","I thought the silver panel looked like an afterthought, and didnt care for the way it (didnt) lay flat."
"4.0","This dress was really big and baggy...maybe because it was a 14W, which may run larger.","I ended up wearing a different dress.","The fabric is beautiful with the embroidered flowers - disappointed it didnt work."
"4.0","I rented this dress for my brother-in-laws wedding.","Unfortunately, neither of the sizes I ordered fit quite right.","The sleeves were too tight, while the waist was too wide.","The fabric was not as smooth as I had hoped and was too stiff to fit to my body.","Luckily, I was able to switch the dress at a Rent The Runway store and ended up with a stunning dress."
"4.0","Bust was too loose, while torso was too tight.","Flattering color with nice cutouts in back."
"4.0","I was pretty disappointed by this dress as I took it out of the bag and the front rouching was torn.","Had to send it back unfortunately."
"4.0","The dress laid weird not a good fit."
"4.0","This top is a really cute idea.","Unfortunately the way it hung in the front was not what I was looking for.","The white section underneath was a bit challenging to figure out which way it should be ironed.","In the end, I ironed it with a pleat to one side and used fashion tape to keep it in place.","The wool (?)","part of the top had too much volume for me in the front.","Had it hung straight down I would have loved this look.","I also found the wool to be scratchy on my skin,  I wore a white button down underneath to solve that issue.","Bottom line:  I wont rent this again as by the end of the day I was happy to take it off and send it back."
"4.0","The dress was heavy, scratchy and made me look fat.","Did not feel comfortable.","The fit was not flattering.","The waistline of the size 0 was too high and I wore size 2 instead.","Should have gone to the showroom to try it on before renting.","I was told it would be delivered before 1pm but it didnt get here until 5 pm and I had very little time to get ready.","I learned my lesson not to do same day rentals!"
"4.0","First, the original size I ordered for this dress (16L) was damaged beyond repair (not RTRs fault, just the previous customers fault - seriously, what were you doing in a rented dress that you damaged it beyond repair anyway???).","RTR sent me a separate dress (but of a completely different look/style - not what I needed) in my original size and then sent me this dress in my back up size (18).","I dont know if it was because the dress was too big or if the dress just wasnt made for my body, but it really did nothing to flatter me.","It did nothing to accentuate my waist and the draping that was supposed to hid problem areas in the front was too low to hid anything.","Once again, this could have been because it was a size too large.","I ended up wearing the dress out of desperation of being away from home (dress was delivered to my hotel), having a mandatory formal work event, and no other choice.","I had such high hopes for this dress and the dress just didnt live up to them."
"4.0","I typically rent a 6 or 8 for the upper body to fit but the sleeves on this dress were too tight (fabric has no stretch) to fit.","I have fairly average arms and I returned this dress immediately."
"4.0","This dress has so much potential -- the thick, nice fabric, gorgeous color, and fun/flirty silhouette.","HOWEVER, the neckline is a major problem and is not at all how its pictured on the model.","The deep v showed almost all of my girls to the point that I laughed when I tried it on.","Apart from wearing a camisole underneath this dress (which would ruin the look in my opinion), or somehow MacGyvering the neckline shut with pins, its unwearable.","I dont think it works with or without a bra (with - you see the whole bra // without - you would see your whole boob from the side because the thickness of the fabric makes it stick upwards).","Hope that helps.","Had to send it back without wearing."
"4.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","I loved the fit at the top (very plunging) and I loved the quality of the fabric.","In the picture, you cant really tell, but when you put it on, the dress really poofs out at the hips.","I have a true hourglass shape and I found the look unflattering."
"4.0","This dress is beautiful!","I love the Art Deco pattern and feel.","Unfortunately, it was small around my hips and I could have worn it but didnt want to be tugging at my dress all night in Vegas.","If you have wider hips, make sure to go up a size."
"4.0","It has an odd fit.","The top is very loose and the bottom of the dress doesnt tapper well to the contour of your body.","It could be a beautiful dress for a fancy event but it just needs a little more shape control in the structure."
"4.0","Unless you are small up top, this dress will inevitably cross and stretch over your chest in such a way that the V part hangs very low, exposing your bra.","It was not appropriate for work!","It was also very loose in the waist/butt, but likely would have looked nice if I had a smaller bust.","Unfortunately if you are C+, this dress likely wont work for you because if you size up, it will be too big everywhere else.","Very disappointing because I loved the color and the fabric."
"4.0","Im 58 and this was way too short for me.","There was no way I could have even worn this with flats.","I did not wear it to the event."
"4.0","Boxy and not very comfortable"
"4.0","i felt frumpy in this dress - perhaps it would work on someone with a fuller figure.","i am petite, and i just felt overpowered by all of the material.","it also wasnt in the best condition."
"4.0","did not end up wearing"
"4.0","The dress was very pretty, fit well/true to size through the body, but I couldnt zip the dress at all because I couldnt get the sleeves up on my arms and across my shoulders.","Very tight through the arms/shoulders."
"4.0","Definitely consider where very tall heels if you are shorter; the bust may also run a bit smaller"
"4.0","I thought I was going to love this dress, but it was way too short for my almost 59 frame.","It was loose around the midsection and had no shape to it at all.","Really unflattering.","I even tried the 6 just for the length and it was still too short."
"4.0","The material of the dress is really pretty and I wish the dress had fit.","The top was too large so the straps looked weird.","If I had sized down, the bottom wouldnt have fit because there was no stretch.","Bummer because I would have loved to be able to wear it for NYE!"
"4.0","It did not hang properly.","I was bummed b/c I thought it was the perfect shirt for a rodeo Sent it back and never wore it."
"4.0","I did not even wear this because the top was cropped way too much for my tall frame and had an ugly boxy shape.","The white part began almost right at or under my bra band... almost an empire waist line.","This may have distorted the rest of the fit, but I thought it was unflattering and boxy.","Looked nothing like the model.","Also, there are slits all the way up the white parts on the sides and each white ruffle is an individual piece of fabric so beware of showing some midriff.","I would recommend this for the petite lady.","Would not recommend for regular or tall height ladies and will not be renting again."
"4.0","This was the first RTR experience, so I rented two dresses.","I didnt wear this one.","Sorry for the terrible photo, but I had no one to help me take the pic.","As other reviews have said the fabric is heavy.","However, it is still a single woven layer of fabric, so its not forgiving either.","Its fairly tight in the midsection and goes out right at my hips which I didnt like.","The arm holes were also quite large on both the M and L and the pit fat wasnt flattering.","I havent worn a high/low before and really wanted to.","However at this length, it felt like I had a cape on.","Wasnt a fan.","If I were to wear it Id wear the L mostly to be a little less tight in the midsection."
"4.0","I usually fit between a 12-14, but they only had size 12 available.","The 12 fit fine, the waist and length was perfect but the bust was too large and possibly stretched out.","Didnt get to wear it, and had ot return it."
"4.0","Sized up to a size 4 because I have bigger arms and couldnt wear.","it."
"4.0","The Medium fit, however the slit in the front of the dress was quite revealing when I sat down, so I wore the back up in Large.","The dress is comfortable and easy to wear, it looks red in the photo but its really hot pink."
"4.0","This would look great on someone long and leggy, but as someone with a big bust and hips and small waist, it made me look shapeless."
"4.0","shorter in the front than the back.","I have a short torso so the length was fine.","It was very see through and itchy.","Wore it for 5 minutes and took it off."
"4.0","The lining is way too heavy.","I couldnt wear it in DC in July."
"4.0","First, I want to say that this dress was more casual in person than it looks in the photo-- I rented it for a cocktail wedding and Im not sure I would have worn it even if it had fit.","One major difference in the dress I got in person was that those two stripes over the darts on the dress were white, instead of the black pictured.","That to me made it look more casual.","This is also two pieces that are only connected in the front but open in the back-- I didnt realize that from the photos.","The material is thick and the print is more prominent in person than it looks in the photos, which I didnt love.","I also confused the European sizing-- the largest size available was a 38, which I thought was an 8 but is actually a 6, so it was too tight to wear."
"4.0","This shirt was just too boxy.","The lace was a very heavy material, almost reminded me of a heavily starched lace doily.","If the shirt had been longer, it would be cute as a boxy tunic paired with leggings, but the shorter length made my already shorter frame appear shorter than it is."
"4.0","It was tighter/form fitting throughout the bottom, but the top was saggy.","I felt like it accentuated my trouble spots (postpartum tummy) and did nothing to accentuate my good spots.","I can see this dress looking great on an hourglass or top heavy figure.","Not mine."
"4.0","I received this as one of my unlimited shipment items.","I usually wear a small, but a RTR stylist told me that an XS would be fine in this style, as it runs a bit large.","I did not find this to be true, as I couldnt even button up the last few buttons on the bottom.","Im 510, 130lbs and usually wear a size 2 in dresses, so I can often fit into an XS, however this was not even close to possible for this cut of dress.","I would recommend not ordering any smaller than you usually wear - order up, if anything.","I was not able to wear this item, which I was pretty disappointed about.","The dress itself is really cute, and would have loved to wear it.","I will be returning it today.",":("
"4.0","The dress fit well, was in great condition and beautiful.","However - the V in the bust is SO deep!","Much deeper than the picture with the model.","It extended down to the underwire of my bra and exposed an enormous amount of my chest.","I ended up having to keep a wrap on the entire time..."
"4.0","I usually wear a size 4 so I ordered the small.","The medium was not available.The dress ran very small.","My breasts were too large to fit the dress and it was too tight.","I could have stuffed myself in and been uncomfortable all night but chose not to.","I did not wear the dress."
"4.0","This dress is really a beautiful color.","But the fabric is really flimsy - major VPL (even with tights).","It got bunchy and creased quickly.","Also, the waist seam looked strange - I covered it with a belt."
"6.0","The large is really big!","I usually like things big and flowy but I almost didnt wear it because it was a little excessive.","I forgot Free People normally runs on the bigger side.","It was Super cute though and got lots of compliments!","I would definitely rent again!"
"6.0","The length was very nice; not too long or too short.","There is a large plunge for women like myself with a large bust , it may show too much.","The sequin were itchy/scratchy and it ran a bit small."
"6.0","Size 6L fit me better than the 8L but the back zipper did not lay down flat and looked funny so I ended up wearing the 8L and it was loose on me but I had to make it work.","In addition, the 8L was defective, the underlining did not line up correctly with the slit of the dress so it ended up appearing like a separate part of the slit.","Another downside is I had to steam the entire dress because the 8L came in so wrinkled I couldnt dare walk out in it.","Bonus is I did receive quite a few compliments on the dress.","It was very comfortable but I dont think I would rent it again.","Definitely will rent from RTR again though!","Best site ever!"
"6.0","For some reason I thought this was a skirt and not gaucho type pants.","The fit was true to size if not a bit small.","These did nothing for my shape and looked frumpy."
"6.0","The top was too narrow at the hips and didnt fit over my hips so I unfortunately couldnt wear it.","Also, Im busty and the first ruffle started at the breast area, accentuating the bust with no waitline."
"6.0","This dress runs small as other customers have mentioned.","I usually wear between a 0 and 2, and ended up wearing the size 2.","I actually ordered a size 2 and 4 backup- theres no way a size 0 would have zipped up (thanks reviews!).","I ultimately went with the size 2 because it offered the most support on top and fit as the dress was meant to.","The size 4 still fit ok, but it did not hug curves as the size 2 did.","HOWEVER- I could barely walk, let alone go up flights of stairs...or dance.","The dress looks great and the color is lovely, but mobility is very limited.","The size 4 might have offered a bit more flexibility but I would have had to pull up all night.","All in all, beautiful dress but just keep in mind that you wont be able to move as much."
"6.0","but wasnt comfortable, especially around the ribs."
"6.0","The fit was a bit looser than I was expecting, and the ruffle detail a bit worn.","The latter didnt seem to be because the sweater itself was worn out, but a conscious design choice.","It was comfy enough but I didnt end up wearing it because it was a bit too casual for my everyday wardrobe."
"6.0","The romper was way cute!!","The length was great and comfortable.","My complaint was that the top was stretched out and the seam was torn.","But that was okay, I just rolled the sleeves and no one new the difference.","My hair covered it, and it looked like it was supposed to be that way.","By the end of this epic party, I was engaged!","So Id say this romper was a hit!"
"6.0","The fit is comfortable, runs a bit large.","The dress is not structured like it is in the picture and like other Halston dresses, maybe because its been worn many times.","The color is more a dull beige and looks almost dirty, rather than the gold-ish hue in the photo.","I didnt feel amazing in this dress, but I was comfortable and appropriately dressed for a wedding."
"6.0","I love the shape of the dress but the fabric is much shinier in person and has so give.","Also, the bottom part is much more flared than I anticipated.","Much more of a mermaid than I thought.","Its cute, just not for me."
"6.0","material was pretty heavy."
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this skirt because it ran too small for me!","Will try it again in a larger size."
"6.0","Im usually between a medium and large, the medium fit, but the large was more comfortable (and flattering)"
"6.0","runs a little large!"
"6.0","great for summer !","!"
"6.0","Rented it for the charity ball, but when I tried it on it looked boring and not very sexy.","The color is beautiful.","Maybe it could work for a more conservative/work related formal function."
"6.0","I ended up exchanging this for a different dress (thank you RTR for saving my a**!)...","long story short I love this style and the gold/shimmer to it.","I currently put on some weight but was hopeful that my extra 15lbs of curve would turn this into a Marilyn va-va-voom, but it went the other way.","Unfortunately it was like a sausage casing dress on me, and that extra tummy and booty I currently hate was REALLY accentuated in this.","Im am 8-10 dress right now and tried both the M & L. Medium zipped and fit (it has some stretch) but felt really fitted... Large was definitely more do-able but I was too insecure about my mid-section in this.","Just a warning to the gals in the same boat!","Its great quality & pretty gold tones in person."
"6.0","I didnt get to wear this dress to my event as the zipper was extremely hard to get up.The dress fit fine once we got it but it took me and my two roommates to  get the zipper over the part where the bottom of the dress connects with the top."
"6.0","Gorgeous dress- but extremely form fitting.","So unless you want EVERY curve in your body to show, this is not your dress.","I typically wear a M but also ordered a L to be sure.","Unfortunately neither fitted me the way I wanted so I ended up wearing something else.","Pity, since it is a gorgeous dress but very clingy!","Ah well...next time!"
"6.0","material was nice.","Ran big.","Size down."
"6.0","Cute dress!","Not theeee most flattering as the skirt is pretty full.","Arrived a bit wrinkled.","Pretty tight in the chest, probably better for someone with a smaller chest."
"6.0","The pattern is gorgeous and photographs really nicely, I just wish the dress had more shape to it.","I have some hips and found the dress to be tight in the middle and big on top.","Also really boxy since its a more structured material."
"6.0","The fleece/sweatshirt part of this is AMAZING but everything else was terrible.","The pants run really small and are completely see-through/thin.","The tank top feels like tissue paper and has the weirdest fit, I really dont know why it exists.","Its such a bummer because the sweatshirt is so cute and sized perfectly.","I would rent again but only to wear that, its a shame its not available on its own.","I would have bought it too, but its only available in the bundle."
"6.0","I am not a large woman, but I am physically fit.","The sleeves had no give what so ever and the sleeves did not go with the size of the dress."
"6.0","I loved the idea of this dress, but it just wasnt made for us pear shaped gals.","The top was way too loose, and the lapels didnt lay correctly on me.","The waist was also too large.","The hip area was not tight, but didnt really lay correctly.","The pockets also laid strangely.","This dress needs a lining.","Also a vast improvement would be if the belt was not attached in the back!","Since it was attached, I couldnt make the belt tighter and simultaneously line up the buckle with the trench style opening.","I still wore it and it looked fine, but definitely not a special occasion dress."
"6.0","These pants were thick and hugged every roll you have (if you have any).","I opted not to wear them because of those reasons.","I was happy about the length, though!"
"6.0","The fabric in this dress was so pretty, I really wanted to wear it, but it just did nothing for my body.","Im curvy and it covered all that ip and made me look boxy.","If all you want to reveal are great legs and have a narrow straight body, this is probably the perfect dress for you."
"6.0","Gapped quite a bit on the top, could not wear without a bandeau.","I ended up wearing another dress."
"6.0","Pretty shirt with gold accents.","You could dress it up or down.","BUT it runs very large.","Very low cut and shoulders kept falling down.","I had to basically fashion tape it to my body."
"6.0","This dress is so pretty, but it ran small and I wasnt able to fit in it."
"6.0","Not for the busty!","Looked like I had 4 boobs!","Lovely dress, but just too small on top if you are above a C cup."
"6.0","I received many compliments on the beautiful embroidery and interesting details of this dress.","While the full skirt was fun for dancing, overall the dress fit me too baggy.","I wore a 0 and am typically a 0/2, but the bust and waist were too large."
"6.0","This dress is very sleek and cool.","However, while Im usually an 8, this dress runs VERY small.","The tightest 8 Ive put on in a while.","It honestly felt like I was trying to fit into a size 4 or 6 dress.","I started panicking when I had to struggle to get it past my hips and my heart sunk when it the clasps were about 4-5ins from even reaching.","There was no way it was fitting over my bust of 36DDD which is unusual because Im almost always an 8 no problem.","Sometimes I can even go down to a 6.","The clothes I wear are size M. Additionally, it was pretty tight around the arm.","Worst part, because of the backup 10R being damaged or not returned in time, I couldnt wear this to the event I was attending.","So if you are very busty and curvy like me, beware of this dress.","I would recommend a size up, but since I didnt even try the 10R I would honestly say pick another dress to avoid the risk of it not fitting properly."
"6.0","It was too big and hung weird around my hips, and so it made me look huge.","I wore it to work one day and I got weird comments.","I sent it back after the one wearing.","Sad cause it was comfy and warm."
"6.0","I really loved this dress but for maybe a night out.","I am 58 and the dress was so short!","I sized up per the reviews but I do not think it helped for length.","I am also small busted with a hourglass figure so the top of the dress was a little big which made it awkward.","Good quality fabric."
"6.0","The arms were a little tight for me, but workable.","This is a fun dress that is super comfortable that you could use for any event"
"6.0","I dont usually wear patterns but this top was really cute.","Unfortunately, I could button it across the bust- too tight.","Should have gotten a size larger."
"6.0","I ordered both the 2 and 4, but ended up going with the smaller size.","It was definitely a little tight in the upper arm/shoulder and I felt constricted when trying to lift my arms up.","The bust, stomach, and hip areas fit fine, but this dress also felt tight at the bottom.","The hem has no stretch and is definitely tighter than the hip area of the dress.","I am definitely hippy with bigger thighs, so I felt that my stride was shortened when walking.","It was also slightly uncomfortable when sitting down because I could feel how tight it was.","The dress was beautifully made and the sequins werent itchy at all!","Overall, not my favorite rental, but Im glad that I tried a new silhouette!"
"6.0","Im between a 10 and a 12, and opted for the 10.","But, in the end couldnt wear it because it didnt fit my arms.","If you are in between, I suggest going up."
"6.0","This dress is beautiful and a  flattering cut.","However, the material is quite a bit thicker than I thought it would be, and pouffed out below the waistband more than I would have thought.","I shouldnt have been surprised, as it is fully lined and has pockets.","I wore it for an outdoor graduation in St. Louis, and it was a bit warmer than I would have liked.","However, its a gorgeous dress.","It hit at tea length for me (at 59 and wearing 3 heels, I would think it might feel a bit long on a shorter person).","The straps have a bit of stretch too them and were very comfortable, unlike some other ribbon straps that are stiff and can cut into your arms.","I wore it all day and was very impressed at how well it wore - didnt wrinkle or stretch out too much."
"6.0","This dress is not made for women with curves at all.","I normally wear a 10 with RTR dresses, most other designers I do 8 to a 10.","This was sent as a backup since my other backup could not be delivered.","Very pretty dress, if you have straight hips."
"6.0","This dress is BEAUTIFUL.","The fabric and embroidery are stunning.","The fit just didnt work for my body type, unfortunately.","While the waist and skirt were very fitted, the shoulders were so broad that the dress simply fell to the sides up top on me.","Thanks to RTRs excellent customer service, another dress was sent to me that I wound up adoring, so it all worked in the end!"
"6.0","This vest is pretty diverse.","It can be worn like in the model picture or over a dress.","I rented for everyday but it could be worn to work too.","The reason I give it three stars is because: 1) the pockets are not real 2) the lining on the opposite site of the pockets shows in the front 3) It doesnt reach as far across my chest as I would have liked."
"6.0","It fits a tad large and I am small busted so please bear in mind it will look better on someone with a fuller bust.","I did not like the pockets in it because it gave it a less formal feel for me and I needed this to look a bit more polished.","I wore it to a theater opening night and had to do the curtain speech.","I like to look sophisticated and put together.","I would look at this piece if I was going to a less formal day wedding or shower, day time event where you want to look pretty but not as formal."
"6.0","This fits way, way, way oversize.","Order 2 sizes down, no joke."
"6.0","I rented this as an option for a surprise 60th birthday party.","It was super tight across my hips/thighs and not flattering at all on me.","I opted for a different rental instead.","The color is great and the style cute, just did not work for my body type."
"6.0","If you have a smaller chest, this jumpsuit is super cute.","Heavy fabric, good quality."
"6.0","Ordered dress in size 4 & 6.","The dress is really short so I preferred the little extra length that the 6 provided.","However, due to my lack of booty, I was unable to fill out the dress in the back and the zipper not laying flat was driving me crazy.","I decided to wear the 4.","The only real problem with the dress is that the zipper does not stay zipped at the top."
"6.0","The dress was more casual than I thought it would be.","It has a very structured top with ribing around the bust, and it did not fit there.","I am 36D-DD and it would not zip at the top.","I got both a 6 and 8 and neither fit, so I ended up sending it back (which was fortunately a very simple process)!","If it had fit Im not sure if I would have worn it because it was a bit casual.","More navy than black and probably better for an event like a birthday or a date not a semi-formal dance!","Overall great experience with RTR even though I did not wear the dress!"
"6.0","I did not end up wearing this dress...","It was an amazing fabric but I am pear shaped, so it was snug on the bottom and too large on the top.","Very pretty though!"
"6.0","The pattern on this dress was gorgeous - until I put it on.","The geometric pattern in the lower midsection drew attention to, and accentuated, my fanny pack area of belly fat...","I looked pregnant/bloated and felt super uncomfortable.","I ended up wearing a completely different dress.","Its great quality and would definitely look good on someone with curves or a flat stomach - just didnt work out for me."
"6.0","the color on this dress is off from the photo.","its more a pure neon orange.","the overall fit is very large and the armholes are also very large.","im typically a 10 or 12, and a medium probably would have been fine.","its hard to imagine this being worn to work; more suitable for the beach or something.","wasnt a huge fan for what i originally rented for."
"6.0","Definitely runs small.","Had to wear a 10 and Im usually a 6.","Tight through the bust, but everywhere else fit normally.","Pretty lace detail and nice material."
"6.0","I strongly recommend this for someone who wants to show off their curves, but may be a little self conscious of certain areas.","It hides extra weight well.","I am in between a 10 or a 12 and have been running on the small side recently.","The 10 fit like a glove, but was a little tight after meals.","The straps are long and tended to fall down.","If you looked closely you could see the dress had some wear, a few laces looked out of place and the boning started poking.","(Ouch!)","I also thought the neckline was odd, it is like an early 2000s trend that I am not sure is coming back.","We made Spice Girl jokes all night.","I just wish I had bright red hair and I really could have pulled off the Ginger Spice look!"
"6.0","Pros: luxe fabric and details.","Eye catching print thats even better in person.","Lovely colors for fall.","Cons: just not flattering on me.","Sleeves were baggy and v neck seemed to aging.","The tennis skirt was a little short for work but the rest of the ensemble wasnt good for a night out.","Overall beautiful quality but not practical or special."
"6.0","Cute, cute color, but the midsection was really baggy so it just wasnt flattering there."
"6.0","Looking at the picture, I though it would make my hips look narrower due to the piping that appears follow a reverse V toward the bustline.","EERRRT Wrong.","It made my hips look huge and gave me a beer belly.","It made me look like the teachers I remember from school (nothing like todays fashionable teachers) like a matronly marm.","Im not saying matronly or marmy is bad, but not quite what I was going for.","Probably would look better on someone  that is not me."
"6.0","I loved the cut outs, but was really self conscious about it because I felt it accentuated my muffin top way too much.","I think I would have been more comfortable in the medium.","I ended up wearing a jacket most of the night to cover up the sides, but the fit everywhere else was fantastic.","Gave me cleavage I never knew I had!","Im 51, 34b, and about 125 lbs."
"6.0","It looks longer in the photo.","It was quite short.","The dress has a thick, high quality fabric.","The shoulders fell a bit as well.","The sleeves are gorgeous.","I wasnt able to wear it d/t the length."
"6.0","Love the style and it is beautiful but do not try and dance in it!","Tore the seam right down the backside on my bachelorette party while dancing!",":/"
"6.0","this dress for the most part fit true to size, but the straps were a bit long so you have to hike your bra down a bit in the back if you dont want it to show.","the material is almost neoprene-y, thicker than i expected.","flares out a bit too soon so probably best worn on a girl with curves."
"6.0","Definitely runs large on top.","I am usually a 6 or 8 when it comes to a tighter fitting dress through the hips, but since this one was only tight around the rib cage, I ordered a 4 and 6 due to the other comments.","The 4 worked best  since the dress runs large through the top.","The dress also came wrinkled on the bottom front, so stuck out funny which was a little annoying (a problem Ive NEVER had with RTR), but I was able to steam it down myself and it ended up fine.","Im 61 and the dress was a tiny bit short, but definitely wearable for someone my height.","Cute dress and great for a summer wedding!"
"6.0","Though the dress fit, the top was not very flattering for a large bust.","I did not wear this to the dinner party as planned."
"6.0","I really like the look of this outfit.","My only complaint is it runs LONG!","I couldnt think of a good way to pull the waist up, so I had to go along with the baggier look.","It would be good if they made, or RTR provided, a petite version of this outfit."
"6.0","The band at the waist is very tight and the fabric has little give.","I ended up wearing myLarger backup size because of the tight waist, but the top looked almost too large.","I felt a little frumpy.","However, I still received lots of compliments and I did enjoy the pockets on the dress.","It was a fun, different look for me, but not one I’d repeat."
"6.0","I rented this for my Vegas Bachelorette weekend.","My friends and I wanted to get out of our typically conservative styles for the occasion - and this dress totally accomplished that.","I tried on both the XS and S in the Las Vegas RTR store - but HAD to go with the S. I tried the overhead and up-the-feet approach with the XS and there was no way that sucker was getting on.","I actually had to have a friend help me get out of what I did manage to get around my body.","XS = SUPER TIGHT.","However, the S fit really comfortably - thats why I was trying so hard for the XS (hoping it would suck me in even more).","I am much smaller up top than I am on bottom (a true pear) - so I ended up having to stuff my bra to fill out the top.","The straps were also kind of loose - but I think if I were larger on top it would have been fine.","I wore Spanx just out of comfort - since I knew I would be dancing and was unsure if the dress would ride up - but I think you could get away without in this dress.","I would definitely recommend for a night of dancing with the girls."
"6.0","I ordered this dress and one other for a wedding, as there werent multiple sizes available in either dress.","This dress was pretty on, but the arms were tight on me.","Plus, due to the multiple layers, it was making me hot on an already humid mid-summers night.","Overall, I just didnt care for how the dress looked on me, although it is very pretty."
"6.0","I am 57 and have a little bit of a booty so this dress, as many of the RTR dresses are, was far too short in back to be worn for anything but a casual night out with my girlfriends.","Would not rent again."
"6.0","This was a great color and I loved it off of my body.","The cut was too low for me to wear a regular bra and therefore I didnt end up wearing it."
"6.0","I was sent this dress as a backup size because my first choice dress was damaged and not able to be sent to me.","This dress was very heavy fabric and big in the bust.","It did look nice on, but definitely wasnt a showstopper dress or anything I would order again."
"6.0","This dress is very classy and flattering.","It was also very appropriate for my event - a rather conservative work related formal function.","However it is not the best fit for my body type.","I am athletic and larger on top than on the bottom.","So the dress was bit loose in the hips, fit well in the waist but was very tight across the ribcage.","It has no stretch, making it a bit uncomfortable for me.","But it still looked great on."
"6.0","Beautiful dress, but runs short!","At 55, a regular length ended up being just about an inch too short for me to wear with low heels.","The 2 generally fit well, although it was a bit large in the bust if you are on the small end.","There was also more of a prominent mermaid shape to the dress than I was expecting.","The dress I received also had issues with the hem hanging below the overlay in the front, possibly due to a tear.","In the end, I didnt wear the dress to my event due to the length issue (there was no long available for the night I needed), but would have loved to had the length not been an issue."
"6.0","Would have loved to wear this dress but very difficult to zipper even going up a size..going up a size didnt help with zipper issue... Bump friendly in torso area just very hard to zipper once on fit comfortably.","This dress however does require a  bigger chest otherwise would look a little strange."
"6.0","It is larger in the top and tighter in the legs.","Because the back is out It felt a little awkward."
"6.0","top was loose but color was great"
"6.0","Beautiful color, love Nicole Miller, but note that the top is extremely low cut"
"6.0","I could not wear this gorgeous dress because of the bizarrely small arms.","I actually have slim arms for my build, so was shocked when I could barely wiggle the arms on.","I was contemplating whether I could still wear the dress as the body of the dress is so beautiful and flattering, but as I started to feel the pulse in my finger tips from having the circulation in my arms cut off, I knew there was no way I could go through an entire day like that.","I was super disappointed to take the dress off, because again, the actual dress itself is one of the most beautiful and stylish dresses I have ever tried on, but ultimately, arm circulation is pretty vital to my day."
"6.0","I loved the color, fabric and quality of the dress and received compliments all night.","That being said the reason Im giving it a 3 out of 5 stars is because the bottom of the lining in the dress is painful when you are sitting.","The lining had a plastic fishnet material so when I sat down, it would melt into my skin.","Every time I got up I would have to peel the plastic off of my thighs which hurt and left fishnet marks on my skin.","By the end of the night my thighs hurt and I didnt even want to sit.","The next morning, my thighs still hurt and were irritated.","Had this been my own dress, I would have cut out the plastic part of the dress."
"6.0","This dress runs incredibly small, I couldnt wear it.","Id recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up, depending on your comfort level.","When it arrived I had to do a double take to make sure it was actually a Medium!","Other than the sizing, great color and I loved the tied-waist detail!","I would definitely rent again, just a few sizes larger!"
"6.0","I didnt end up wearing this dress.","It was super cute but did not fit me the right ways - I felt like it might have been a bit inappropriate for the wedding I rented it for.","The v in the front was low enough that, with a bra I had great cleavage (not grandparent-appropriate), but without a bra the dress was too big on the top.","Maybe for a different kind of formal event where there are less family members.","Also the color is really bright.","If I rent this dress again Id probably try out the blue!"
"6.0","Sadly I did not take any pictures in this dress but it was cute but nothing spectacular.","The fabric is thick and comfortable but fits a little loose.","I wore the 0 and honestly could have sized down on that because it felt like it should fit more snug on my body.","I thought i would love the frilled side hem but it looked odd."
"6.0","The fit was a bit weird-- tight in the shoulders and arm holes but even more billowing than it looks in the photo.","Hits at an awkward angle.","Back was super cute, though."
"6.0","I rented this as an alternate choice for a holiday party but it wasnt super flattering with white on my athletic arms I felt like I looked bulky.","I wore it to church and it was a nice dress but not something I would wear to wow on a date or at a party.","I didnt even take photos in it - thats how underwhelmed I was.","For a pear/hourglass athletic girl it just didnt accentuate my best features the way other dresses from RTR have before."
"6.0","This dress is really cute but not great for my body type.","The waist and length were both the right fit, but the shoulders and hips were a bit too tight (this is not unusual for me, but just a note if you are a pear shape too!",")."
"6.0","There is no give in the fabric and the waist was too tight when zipped up.","I could not wear it.","There were a lot of snags and small pulls in the fabric."
"6.0","The dress has very pretty colors and the length is appropriate for work.","The black piping enables you to wear a black cardigan or blazer over it to dress it up a little for the office.","The turquoise in the dress looks great with a pair of turquoise earrings or necklace, which is fun.","Unfortunately, the waist hit at an awkward spot and actually I thought that the piping served to broaden your waist, rather than minimize it (visually).","Also, the dress is made of cotton, so it is definitely more casual that I expected and it wrinkled easily."
"6.0","I did not wear the dress because the top was much larger than the bottom and it stuck out under the arms.","If you have a larger chest this dress would be perfect."
"6.0","I wore a belt with it which definitely helped but you can tell in the photo the it was a little baggy.","I think the 2 would have fit my waist but would have been far too short.","I loved it overall and had many compliments on the style and color.","Everyone is shaped different so it may just be me.","Might be better for someone who is a little bustier."
"6.0","this shirt smelled like a perfumed disinfectant - I really hope thats not what Ill be experiencing with this service"
"6.0"," I ordered a 4L and a 6L.","The 4L was too small in the bust and short.","The 6L was prefect length and bottom half fit a little big but because its not a fitted dress it was fine.","The problem was that the darts on the dress are short and high.","The way the dress was sewn, the darts stuck way out and I was not able to fill it out enough to flatten them so it was very unflattering."
"6.0","I got the 4 and 6 in this dress for my birthday dinner and sadly wasnt able to wear either dress.","The 4 definitely fit better than the 6.","I didnt think I had a long torso, but the hips on the dress hit way too high causing it to look frumpy and ill-fitting.","Colors are gorgeous and the back is awesome.","Would work well if you have a small torso.","Also, as other reviewers mentioned this dress is definitely on the shorter side"
"6.0","The pattern is very whimsical and would have been a clutch choice except I didnt like the polyestery feeling of the fabric.","Also, the front is low cut and wouldnt have been appropriate to wear to work.","Love the brand though, so looking forward to renting other options."
"6.0","I ordered this dress for an outdoor wedding.","The bride described the dress code as fancy picnic so the style of the dress was perfect.","It flared out from the waist which made it less of a formal feel than some of the other tighter fitting dresses I was looking at.","The color was beatuiful, it was the type of yellow where with the right accessories you could still pull it off for a fall wedding but definetly a hit for a summer type event.","My only complain was the dress ran a tad on the bigger size, I ordered a size 4 and I am 5 foot 6 inches and 120 lbs and I easily had at least 1 inch of fabric that I could collect with my hands on the left and right side of the dress.","And because of the open back (which was gorgeous) it meant the sleeves also slid down.","I was considering belting it, but because of the straps constantly falling I opted against wearing the 4.","I called RTR and a 2 wasnt available but the girl on the phone was SOOOOOO helpful she offered to send a NEW dress my way and helped give me advice on which one to select as an alternative and search for a dress in my size.","As much as I loved both dresses I got, the customer service is what will make me a repeat customer they were so helpful in making sure I had an outfit for my event and made the whole process as stress free as being out of town with a dress that doesnt fit can be.","Thanks RTR!","!"
"6.0","It was super flattering and very comfortable to dance in.","I was a little concerned because the material was a bit like a  bridesmaids dress - so it seemed a little flouncy.","In the end I was glad I wore it, and felt like I looked good."
"6.0","Beautiful, classy dress- however, ideal for someone with narrow shoulders, as the sleeves really enhanced my broad shoulders.","Made for someone very slender and narrow, but a very pretty dress!"
"6.0","I liked this dress but i am a size 10/12 and the L wouldnt even zip up, it also really short.","Very disappointed in this not fitting.","I would need XL but clearly wouldnt order that size."
"6.0","na"
"6.0","I tried this dress on in the BCBG store and it fit me nicely- but, I did know that I needed spanx because the dress is unforgiving for anyone who has a bit of a belly... however, when I got the rented dress- it fit me differently although in the same size- I realized that the top lace part had stretched out- so it made the dress looser and didnt hold the girls in as well.","It was pretty long- and so wear high heels!","I received many compliments on it- I would have rested it higher- but I felt a little uncomfortable in it knowing that all my curves were on display."
"6.0","Definitely not made for those with curves.","I was able to pull the dress up but sadly thats as far as it went.","The top of the dress would have fit great but the inner skirt has zero give and I wasnt able close it.","Had to send this beauty back"
"6.0","I was hoping it would look a little more casual, summer day.","But it ended up feeling a little more like an outfit for Sunday afternoon tea."
"6.0","I know that I ordered a 2P size, but I find it hard to believe that this is actually a petite size.","Even with 4 inch heels, I had to pin it up about an inch and a half around the waist area.","I know Im very short, but still, its hard to imagine that this was a true petite.","Otherwise, the fit was good.","I wore it with an adhesive bra, which worked well for me.","I wouldnt recommend the dress for someone whos my height, because it was a hassle to figure out how to make the length work, but if youre 51 or taller, and have heels, it should work nicely!"
"6.0","I got this dress to wear as a casual weekend look.","Paired it with some flat sandals and it looked... Ok. You definitely need it tied because otherwise its just a box.","Wouldnt rent again."
"6.0","Waist fit.","Chest was much too small.","Would have been beautiful if it fit properly"
"8.0","This dress was super cute!","I usually wear a size 8.","As this dress does run in European sizes, I chose a size 44.","It did run a little large, I would recommend sizing down for a back up size.","Although it had no stretch, it was super comfortable throughout and was very roomy in the bust area.","It would work great for any cup size.","I am 53 , it was about 5 inches below my knee, a perfect tea length dress.","I wore this with standard undergarments and it worked great.","Perfect for any body type!"
"8.0","Classy, elegant, fun, gorgeous color, unlike pictured on the website"
"8.0","I wore this for a Thanksgiving dinner.","The material is heavy and the craftsmanship is well done.","However, I did find the dress a bit larger than I was expecting."
"8.0","Wore this to an outdoor summer wedding at a castle, paired with coral accessories, clutch & shimmery silver/white strappy heels.","The fit was good, a little long (more tea length) for my height, but I wore 4 heels to make up for it!","The material is on the thicker side, but I was never too hot / sweaty, even on the dance floor.","Loved the pockets, which held my i-Phone 6 and my lip gloss with no noticeable bulges.","While you can wear a regular bra with this dress, the only negative thing I can report is that there are straps to secure your bra to the tank straps of the dress... mine were busted (and since Im not a person who sews anything), I didnt end up using them and had to adjust my bra a few times and tuck those straps in."
"8.0","This was such a pretty top and I liked to lightness of the fabric.","It was very loose below the shoulders which made it difficult to pair with any bottoms, but I still received many compliments on it.","The shoulders stayed down and the colors are great!"
"8.0","I ordered a size 4 and 6; I vary from a size 2-6 depending on the designer.","The dress fit is great and shows all the right curves.","The material is not too heavy for a summer wedding and the dress material was very comfortable, I could have worn it all day.","The dress does restrict movement since it is fitted but I did not have any problems dancing, more bending down and getting in and out of cars.","The size 4 fit everywhere but, was a little loose at the top of the dress, I used double sided dress tape as a safety and I was fine.","I would highly recommend this dress and am even considering buying it for future use!"
"8.0","I loved this dress, but I could not zip it on my own--and it wasnt because of fit.","The zipper runs over the leather trim, making it very hard to zip.","Luckily the babysitter could do it before I left!","So I recommend not getting dressed solo."
"8.0","Dress is tight.","I went up a size and it was still tight, almost didnt wear it.","The lace does not have stretch.","If you are large chested, you may consider not renting it.","Lace is beautiful and great for a fall/winter wedding."
"8.0","I am 510 and between a size 6-8.","The 6 was too small but the 8 fit me perfectly.","The sequin material bothered the skin underneath my arms over the course of the night, but other than that a very comfortable dress!","I got many compliments on it and everyone loved how sparkly it was.","Would highly recommend!"
"8.0","I just had a baby 4 months prior so I ordered up.","Im usually a 6 through my hips and a 2-4 in my waist.","The 6 fit me, but as stated, is a bit short, and snug through the shoulder detail.","I wore the 8 so I could dance around without the dress riding up, and to be more comfortable in my new-mom body.","I felt great in this dress and would order it again."
"8.0","It is very comfortable and forgiving.","It is difficult to see from the model image, but there is a gather at the waist which I didnt truly love.","If I hadnt had a second dress choice I liked better, I would have worn this and been very happy."
"8.0","Fits a bit small in the crotch so I recommend sizing up.","The cutouts and neckline were very flattering.","Id love to rent this again."
"8.0","I wore this dress to an outdoor wedding in July, and despite the heat, it kept me cool.","I got tons of compliments while wearing this, and was extremely comfortable the entire night.","The best part of the dress was that I didnt have to wear a bra due to the open backing and criss-cross ties and boning within the dress.","Even though I didnt fill out the chest area (I have a small chest), it still looked great.","The only downside of this dress was that the slip was itchy, but other than that it was a winner.","I would definitely rent this dress again!"
"8.0","The fabric has very little give at the top so if you are bigger busted this might not be the dress for you.","The fabric is very forgiving though and the bottom is fun and flirty."
"8.0","I wore this dress to my company Holiday Party.","It was so fun and glamorous.","I love the cut for a work function very subdued.","Some of the sequins were loose on the dress, but otherwise everything was perfect."
"8.0"," Flirty and fun, the top was sophisticated with a deeper v neckline but a poofy bottom that made the outfit more whimsical.","This dress has an awesome exposed back that would look best without a bra, or with a NU bra.","The lace provides a structured support in the front so braless is totally feasible.","This dress fit small in the waist as the lace has little give.","I was wearing a 2 and the 0 would have been too tight.","I would recommend sizing up for the backup.","The hip area had plenty of room and the tulle falls loosely like a ballerina around from your waist out.","This is defs a hip friendly dress.","At 5’7” this dress hit below the knee almost mid calf.","Great for black tie wedding or any event that you want to make a statement.","Would go great with some dangly earrings and a shiny clutch."
"8.0","I received size 6 and 8.","The 6 fit great was a bit snug in the bodice .","I went with the 8 however as the night went on it gave a little too much"
"8.0","This dress is gorgeous.","Very classic.","The fabric had some weight to it but wasnt heavy to wear.","I loved the poof of the skirt and how it accentuated my waist.","The fit was very comfortable.","I did wear a low back bra because I had it but wasnt a necessity.","I was a bit unsure of what size Id need because of recent weight loss and I was pleasantly surprised that the 14 fit just fine and could have even been a little tighter in the top.","When I originally tried it on the slip was hanging down below the hem a little in the front but once I steamed the dress I didnt see it.","Overall loved the dress and felt like a million bucks.","Great first RTR experience!","!"
"8.0","Im 52 130lbs 34DD so a definate hour glass shape.","The size 6 was okay, but just pulled slightly at my hips and was perfectly skin tight everywhere else.","I probably could have done the size 8 but I liked how form fitting it was.","The lace is very sexy,  And the best part was I could wear a regular bra!"
"8.0","So many compliments - beautiful, flowy dress.","Flattering but forgiving.","Had to pin the chest area so my bra would not show but that was not a problem"
"8.0","The fit was tight.","Not too tight but very form fitting.","I loved that it was a thick material since I always get cold in restaurants and did not want to have to coat check.","I thought the lines hit all the right curves.","It was a little short so I opted to wear black tights with it and it was fine :)"
"8.0","I was worried about it being to bridal, but it looked great against my husbands blue suit and I had enough room to breathe (and eat!)","in it.","I ordered both the 4R and the 6R and wore the 6.","It was a little long, but I wore tall heels and it was just fine."
"8.0","I went with the 4, but it was a bit loose fitting.","I probably could have gone with a size 2."
"8.0","I rented this dress as a back-up for a military event.","The dress was absolutely beautiful, but I ended up choosing the other dress because the zipper on this was very difficult to zip due to the fabric and ruching.","I was going to be getting ready on my own and didnt know if my date would be able to actually manage the zipper on his own... when I tried it on, it took me, my sister, and my mom to get it zipped (even though the size was perfect)."
"8.0"," It definitely runs short, hitting at the upper thigh, something to think about if you plan on dancing.","The back does shift around a bit (some suggest fashion tape) but the size 4 fit me pretty well and this helped keep the dress in place.","Fabric is stretchy, easy to wear.","A great dress for the price."
"8.0","A bit clunky at the top"
"8.0","Ended up with this dress as a back-up after my original order didnt work.","Loved the longer hem in the back.","At 54 this was a good length for a wedding (though I could have gone shorter).","Looks great with a pointed toe shoe.","I found this true to size as its fitted in the waist and stomach...this dress wont hide a non-flat tummy but I still felt cute in it."
"8.0","I was a bit self conscious in this, but I generally keep more covered up.","Its maybe for girls that are more confident showing off their bodies or look more like the model in the listing.","Still, I loved the dress, it was comfortable and well made, and my boyfriend was very interested in purchasing it.","I rented it with the Oscar de la Renta Luxembourg necklace and loved that too."
"8.0","Rented this for NYE at a steakhouse with a group of 10.","I am 5 11 and it was definitely short (as I expected) I wore flats and it was fine (and I am fairly conservative and 33), I was comfortable with it but just a heads up.","I loved the simplicity of the one shoulder and felt great in this dress."
"8.0","Fit was great.","The lace was a little tight in the arms but it eventually loosens up."
"8.0","The color of this dress is gorgeous.","I received tons of compliments the night of the party and got even more when I posted the picture on Facebook.","The dress was very comfortable and the pockets are so awesome.","I ended up wearing the size 4 because the top on the 6 was a little loose.","I am definitely smaller up top then I am in my midsection and waist so due to the flair of the skirt I was able to go with the smaller size."
"8.0","it fit well.","Im an athletic 54 and the 4 fit great.","Lots of compliments"
"8.0","I loved how the dress hugged me in all the right places!","However, I am 411 and the dress did not come in a petite so it was a weird length.","Nonetheless, I received so many compliments all night and everyone loved how vibrant the color was on this dress.","My husband couldnt keep his hands off of me:) I also loved how this dress was strapless and stayed in place all night!","I danced and partied all night long and never once did I have to adjust my dress.","I did wear the back up because Im usually a sz 0 but the sz 2 was felt looser and I just felt sexier in it!!","I highly recommend this dress!!","It was so much fun to wear and it was sexy and classy!!","I just wish this dress came in petite sizes!!","!"
"8.0","This is a beautiful top but I could not wear it because of how tight it was in the bust.","I am a 32 DD so not that large but the bust was far too tight to be comfortable.","It is too bad because it is a beautiful top."
"8.0","This dress was awesome for a wedding!","I love the pop of colors for a spring/summer wedding.","Plus it has pockets :).","The one thing I will say is that the material isnt stretchy so I would order up a size with your free dress just in case.","The chest and waist was a little tight in the 0 but I was super comfortable in the 2."
"8.0","The colors are gorgeous and it photographed well.","Both sizes had very problematic zippers.","I ended up wearing the larger size, because the zipper was slightly easier to yank up.","It has some uncomfortable boning in it, but that did eliminate the need for a bra.","My only complaint was the cut of the dress- very small with a lot of extra material around the zipper."
"8.0","I ordered this dress as a backup but ended up liking it much better than my original choice.","I ordered a size up as other posters suggested and it fit perfectly.","The length was just right for me with 3 heels.","This was just the right combination of conservative elegance for a black tie work event."
"8.0","This is the second time I rented this dress for a Saturday night wedding.","Being a full 34DD I do not go braless.","I purchased the low-back strap converter from RTR with my first rental and it worked perfectly.","Because of the cap sleeves and high neck I wore a regular bra and was able to dance the night away without a worry in the world.","The second time I rented the dress there was definitely a bit more wear in in.","The hemline hit mid-knee, but put with the very low back and curve-fitting stretch of the material it was just enough classy as sexy.","Great for curves."
"8.0","I really liked the pants, or rather I really wanted to love them, but the fit was just a touch on the awkward side for my frame.","The length looked like regular pants on my short legs which was totally good by me, the pockets were nice and deep, but didnt gape.","The problem comes with the waist and hip ratio where the hips had a little bit of extra wiggle room and then the waist gaped a ton, you probably couldve seen down the back of my pants if I hadnt tucked a shirt into them.","Over all, great but I might try again with a smaller size to see if they fit better next time."
"8.0","The fabric and fit of the dress were good quality and flattering.","Fitted and sexy and not too revealing... except for the slit.","I was unable to wear the dress past the church ceremony (had to change into a friends dress for the reception) because slit was so high it showed my underwear if I took a wrong step (or really if I moved at all).","I have a short torso and short frame so may not be a problem for others.","But if you are ordering and are petite, Id recommend having a backup style."
"8.0","I didnt end up wearing this to my rehearsal dinner but it fit great and was a beautiful choice, just the perfect length for girls under 52 (Im really 5 3/4).","There is a slight sheen to it that you cant really see in the photos online."
"8.0","I received my size (10) and an 8 and decided to go with the smaller size.","I think the 10 fit very well and I probably would have been a little more comfortable overall in it but the eights tighter fit was very flattering for the cut of the dress."
"8.0","I feel as though this would fit true to size for most people, however with my body type it ran big.","I have a smaller upper body and larger hips, so the 2 fit best when I usually wear a 4.","The pleats did not fall as well as it I thought they would, so I think this might be best for someone with smaller hips.","Other than that, the material was beautiful, the color was great, and it was one of the most comfortable dresses Ive worn to a wedding yet."
"8.0","The dress was amazing, but I would like to say that even though I looked on what shoe height was recommended and whether I should get the regular or the long it ran a little long.","Without heels I was tepping on it and with the heels I had it was really close.","There was a little tear in the bottom of the dress that we tried to fix, and almost on top of my left behind there was a little spot.","None of this ruined my experience and no one noticed, but I would just like to mention it."
"8.0","I got this as an option for dinner on our anniversary weekend.","The places we ended up going to were a bit too casual for this,  especially when I realized just how short it was.","I could have pulled it off in Vegas but not in Portland, Maine!","So I threw it over leggings with black heels and wore it out anyway, because I loved it that much.","The colors were so pretty for early fall and it was comfortable.","I didnt find the sleeves scratchy at all.","I would love to try it again for a real night out someday!"
"8.0","It is a gorgeous dress, no doubt about it.","It was not the best fit for me, though, as it flattened my girls and was very form-fitting around my belly.","I am sure someone with a smaller chest and smaller waist than I have would look perfect in it!","I have to say, all the complements were that is a beautiful dress, as opposed to you look amazing in that dress.","Not the dresss fault that I need to get in better shape!",":)  I usually wear a 12 or 14 but in this dress the 16 was snug.","This was my first time using RTR and their service was exceptional.","I am going to use RTR again in a couple weeks."
"8.0","The dress is beautiful and very comfortable.","I received lots of compliments!","For anyone who needs a petite size, note that the straps are very long.","Im 5 ft tall.","I ended up using a ribbon to tie them together in the back and it worked well- but otherwise the top would not have stayed on.","Overall I loved it and was super happy with his choice."
"8.0","I love this blazer - its chic and looks very expensive.","Its important to note two things: 1) it runs small, and 2) the material is more of a quilted cotton-y material, as opposed to a traditional tweed.","This material makes it a warmer jacket, so be sure to rent only if youre in chillier weather.","If you wear it in the hot summer months, youd be roasting."
"8.0","Loved this dress, although, it was quite short and when I sat down, I was showing 80% of my thigh.","No matter.","The material was amazing - the thick piping over the gray underlay was lovely.","It was so different than any other dresses and I think thats why people kept noticing and complimenting it.","Id definitely wear it again.","I wore it with hot pink suede pumps to give it a little pop of color.","So fun!"
"8.0","The sleeves are a bit short but the sweater is still very cute."
"8.0","Great pattern, nice tailoring.","I thought it ran a little big but every designer size is different."
"8.0","Little snug around rib cage but otherwise very comfortable and flattering.","Love the color."
"8.0","I wore this for my friends bachlorette party.","This for sure runs big.","I normally wear a size 12, but the chest was massive.","Be prepared for some gaping issues and the need for pinning or fashion tape.","I would say this runs a full size big and would suggest ordering down for your back up size.I felt like there was sufficent room in the waist for us hippy girls and would also look great on someone with a larger chest (D or larger)  I wanted to wear something black to put the attention on the bride to be, but still wanted to look great.","I felt there was a lot of room in the stomach area which could be great for concealing for those that need it, but for me, I think it made me look larger than I reall was.","I think this was a little classier and glamorous for our romp around the town at various bars and nightclubs but it worked for me.","This dress would be great for a Christmas party, roaring 20s theme event or any type of nightime fundraiser."
"8.0","Back was pretty long.","I am 58.5 and wore an 8 regular with 2 inch heels and it was almost dragging on the ground.","Im normally a size 6 but based on other reviews ordered up and the 8 worked great - a little wide but totally wearable.","Has bright silver threads running through so doesnt need much jewelry.","Looks good with silver, gold, black, dark red/maroon, etc."
"8.0","It felt a little big in the bust, but because it is a flowy material it didnt have too much impact on the overall fit.","I really liked the length.","Im very tall so I can never find things that are a good length but this would probably be floor-length for a female of average height."
"8.0","Runs a little small.","I wish the next size up was available because I probably would have loved the 8, although the 6 was ultimately fine in the end."
"8.0","Loved the dress.","Ran a little large for me.","I used the smaller back up size."
"8.0","Not only did people stop and stare, but many felt a need to approach me and tell me how stunning, gorgeous, or beautiful my dress was.","The dress is definitely on the short side but is comfortable, easy to wear, and sexy and sassy while keeping a touch of class.","Will definitely rent again if not purchase.","The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the material did seem like it had been worn often."
"8.0","The dress runs large I am a true 10 but wore the 8 because the shoulders are very large in this dress.","I was worried about the arms because mine are long but they were long enough for me.","The  dress does wrinkle very easily on the bottom.","Statement necklace is a must with the high neckline!","Overall great dress!"
"8.0","Fits true to size, length is great..not too short."
"8.0","I normally wear a 6 or an 8 in other dresses and the 6 was a bit too big.","I would have worn the 4 except it was VERY short and since I was hosting a bridal shower and would be moving around a lot/moving presents, I didnt feel comfortable wearing something that short.","It was super comfortable, and I was complimented by everyone at the shower.","The pockets were great to stash my phone in them and being able to snap photos throughout the event, without having to physically hold my phone all afternoon.","I had the dress on for 6+ hours, and could have worn it for another 6 hours!","I paired the dress with a pair of sparkly silver heels."
"8.0","This dress fit like a glove and I truly did not want to send it back!","The only reason I took off a star is for the quality of it.... it has a somewhat thick material and it was really wrinkled when it came.","I tried to hang it in the bathroom with the steam from the shower for almost an hour but the wrinkles just wouldnt fall.","I think it would have been much better if I had time to get it dry cleaned/professionally steamed.","But overall it fit perfect.","I wore the size 4 with a regular bra without a problem.","The length was perfect on me to be flirty and fun but appropriate and I am 59.","Loved this dress & did not want to send it back!"
"8.0","I am in between sizes.","I ended up wearing the larger size of the two dresses I rented.","The only thing I would have preferred for this dress was for it to be longer.","It only dropped down to my ankles, while the other bridesmaids had dresses that dropped down to their toes.","It didnt look horrible, but...... tall girl problems :)"
"8.0","Fit is large, hits at the knee."
"8.0","It was slightly big for a petite person of my size so I opted to belt it.","Loved it anyways!"
"8.0","I wore this dress to a live and silent auction gala with a Midnight in Paris theme.","Received lots of compliments and it was a perfect dress for a warmer than expected night.","RTR did not have size 6 available at the time I ordered.","I ordered a 4 and 8 hoping one would work.","I ended up wearing the size 4 and probably wouldve had a better fit with the size 2.","I think this dress runs a bit large.","Still very comfortable.","The fabric does wrinkle easily (but responds nicely to a steamer) and the dress arrived with a few small snags, not visible to anyone except me.","The layers flow nicely and the shorter asymmetric hem hit me just below mid thigh.","This dress is perfect for outdoor wedding, more formal garden party, or Derby party."
"8.0","I loved this dress but, it was my backup dress for another dress I ordered on RTRW.","The only reason I didnt wear it is I felt like the other one I ordered was more appropriate since it was a vert formal event.","But, it was comfortable and looked nice on."
"8.0","It is low, although youre covered you can see the cleavage and the tops of the ladies in this.","Even though its a fabric over a liner, I still felt more comfortable in spanx.","I received multiple compliments and would recommend this dress for a fun event!"
"8.0","Wore it to work with booties for a transitional summer/fall outfit.","Very cozy and had pockets which I always love.","Its a loose dress so definitely more for a casual event."
"8.0","paired with jeans and pointy flats.","So many compliments!"
"8.0","I wish it didnt have a holes in the sleeve.","Worn is ok, not holes (for work)."
"8.0","The 0 was all that was available and it fit fine.","I should have worn a long dress to the event.","This dress is pretty conservative and could be worn to almost any dressy event."
"8.0","Received so many compliments on this dress.","Not much extra give because of the fabric, so would definitely suggest renting your regular size and the size up."
"8.0","I rented this dress for work, paired with black tights.","The top and arms/shoulders are definitely snug.","It had a nice fit - tight at the waste and then flared out.","It was a bit itchy but not horrible.","Got lots of compliments."
"8.0","I had been dying to rent this dress and finally got the opportunity.","I wore it to an evening wedding on the water and it was perfect.","Like all the other reviews say, the dress is short and definitely rides up if youre doing a lot of walking or dancing.","I chose to wear the 0 for a tighter fit.","In doing so, i didnt need to put any tape or anything on the back of the dress.","It stayed completely flat the entire night.","I have a small chest so i chose to go bra-less.","I wore the dress with hot pink wedges and it looked great.","The colors in this dress are so vibrant and beautiful!","It also looked amazing in pictures.","It was very comfortable and different than any other dress Ive worn.","This one is a winner!"
"8.0","The fit of the dress was good.","Its not one of my favorites but a conservative comfortable dress.","I was told numerous times  you look very put together.","I normally dress up for work but this dress is of high quality and people can tell the quality of the dress by sampling looking at it."
"8.0","The fit is pretty true to size and I was surprised that the vertical stripes did not make me look or feel larger than I am.","The one issue I did have, which was mentioned by another reviewer, is that the zipper is pretty tricky so Im glad the size 10 gave me a little room to try and work with it.","Definitely worth the fight with the zipper though and I would absolutely rent it again if not for all the other amazing options I want to try."
"8.0","fits very tight in the arms"
"8.0","This dress was beautiful even more so in person as the color is very vibrant and the dress shows off your curves in an elegant manner!","The laced arm sleeve is very delicately made.","Though true to its size, it is pretty form fitting, so be wary of bending/being very active in this dress!","Also, as others have noted, the zipper seems to get stuck at the belt area, so you will need a helper handy!"
"8.0","Was just too revealing for the crowd attending the wedding.","Picked a more conservative dress but it was lovely."
"8.0","I wish i would have ordered an 8 in this dress as it was extremely tight in the arms.","I couldnt raise my arms over my head out of fear that I would rip the dress.","Next time, I would go up a size, but other than that, its a lovely dress."
"8.0","loved the dress, wish I could have kept it.","Only complaint - somewhat tight in bust.","Wish it were lower cut"
"8.0","I liked.","it but it wasnt as form fitting as I would have liked"
"8.0","This was the perfect dress for a holiday party!","I gave it 4 stars because the lining around the neckline was coming out of the top of the dress.","It definitely ran small, so I would go a size up.","I was worried the dress would be too short for a work Christmas party, but it was a perfect length."
"8.0","This dress was super short.","Im 511 so that may not be true for someone shorter.","It was very flattering and easy to wear.","No special under garments needed b/c fabric is thick enough to be forgiving.","Overall a great dress!","!"
"8.0","I usually wear a size 4 but this dress was too large.","The size 2 was unavailable, but I think it would have worked well.","Sorry I didnt get the chance to wear it but I would order it again in the smaller size."
"8.0","I read all the reviews and was afraid of the dress being too small so I went with the medium.","It was a little too large for me as the evening progressed.","It kept getting looser."
"8.0","The dress was very true to size, if I had bought it,  however  I would of had the straps altered, they were a little loose."
"8.0","The dress was beautiful, and very comfortable, but ran pretty big.","A size 2 typically fits me, but this one had some unfortunate gaping around the cutout portion.","May be better for someone with a larger chest than mine."
"8.0","The fit was perfect.","I do not recommend wearing the sticky bra with it though.","There is NO support whatsoever in the chest area so my boobs looked very flat wearing those sticky cups, theres also a peek a boo in the back so the bra part is tricky.","Other than that it was beautiful!"
"8.0","Im 51 32-24-35 and wore a size 0.","The waist was about 2 too big and the hem was below-the-knee (almost tea-length) on me, which I expected from reading previous reviews.","Loved the open back and the lace was lovely but the look overall read a bit twee on me.","However, the dress can be demure & sultry on others with more height who fill out the dress better."
"8.0","I ordered this for a Thanksgiving dinner at a restaurant with family.","The top is very nice.","I steamed it ahead of time, but it ended up wrinkling a bit more than I would have liked.","The arms are gorgeous.","The ruffles are very pretty and worked well for the occasion.","The stripes are a charcoal gray, which looked great with my black pearls.","I thought about buying this top, but I dont quite love it enough to own it permanently.","It was definitely a successful rental!"
"8.0","This was a beautiful dress and perfect for a late spring wedding.","I loved the ombre effect of the lace from nude to pink and it matched perfectly with a pair of nude heels.","The fit was nice, however I was not a big fan of the neckline and would have preferred it be a little lower cut as it made my top half look boxier than it really is.","I ended up having to wear a sticky bra with it because my normal bra made it the top of the dress look huge.","Other than that, it fit well and looked beautiful.","I received many compliments and might consider renting this dress again in the future."
"8.0","I love this dress.","Definitely my favorite Ive rented from RTR so far.","Im tall, 59, and this dress was the perfect length, just a couple inches above the knee.","If youre shorter, it will probably hit knee length, my roommate tried it on and it looked kind of awkwardly long - but it was perfect for me.","RTR service great as always.","Also, this dress has pockets!","The only thing I didnt like was that the sleeves were a little tight for dancing, but for normal wear that is no problem.","The color is true to pictures, and it is lined with a nice satin material."
"8.0","I usually wear a 12, but should have sized down.","The armholes where huge on me, but I wore it anyway with a little white sweater to cover the poor fit.","I think Ill try it in a 10."
"8.0","The dress was beautiful.","The color was great and was complimented a lot.","The slit was quite high when sitting, and that made me a little uncomfortable.","The dress is form fitting but still flattering."
"8.0","I am petite and liked that this dress worked for me length wise.","I received lots of compliments!"
"8.0","Beautiful dress, but runs small in the chest area - not ideal for large chested ladies such as myself!"
"8.0","This dress was perfect for a baby shower I helped put on.","Very flattering and, as always when I use RTR, I got several compliments.","I ended up wearing the 4, although it was a tad restrictive in the rib cage area.","It draped nicely over the hips (my usual problem area), though."
"8.0","I rented this dress for my sisters bridal shower and loved the color, fabric, and detail at the neckline.","HOWEVER, they arent kidding when they say the waist runs small.","I am very glad I ordered a size up for my backup because the 6 would never have fit around the waist.","The skirt on the 8 was a bit roomy but the bust was slim and the seem around the waist was uncomfortably tight by the end of the day.","Size up!"
"8.0","ok this dress is stunning.","the fold in the front is beautiful, very classy.","the only reason this isnt 5 stars is because the front V portion is open.","completely open.","if you have boobs theyre going to show.","in their entirety.","it does NOT look that way on the model, but the dress is cut down to the fold in the front.","there is a massive gap.","i cldnt size down either because the waist wldnt have been as comfortable, but even if i did, it wld def NOT be work or dinner appropriate.","im typically btwn a 2 and 4, got the 4 and it fit comfortably around my waist and shoulders.","i wore a black tank under and it looked great, but wish i didnt have to!","if your cup size is smaller, perhaps this would work?"
"8.0","This dress was exactly what I expected when I rented it.","It is fitted without showing too much of anything.","It was a good quality material and fit well.","I would highly recommend this dress for women who are looking for something simplistic or modest.","That being said, this is the shortest long I have ever rented from Rent the Runway.","You cant tell in the picture, but it was about 2 off the ground.","This was the case for both the 6L and the 8L.","Moreover, I just felt like the dress was missing something the whole night, but I also think this is because I tend to wear less simplistic dresses."
"8.0","The one shoulder design allowed me to focus more on my makeup than stress about what necklace to wear with the dress.","The pockets meant that I could easily carry a lipstick and ID with me without worrying about a clutch.","The deep black and teal/blue color is perfect for any season.","The size 10 was a bit large in the upper but due to the waist I went with this size for comfort though either size could have worked."
"8.0","The dress fit perfectly in an XS.","I am 52, 32B, 118lbs.","Lots of compliments and perfect for a spring wedding."
