"10","An adorable romper!","Belt and zipper were a little hard to navigate in a full day of wear/bathroom use, but that's to be expected.","Wish it had pockets, but other than that-- absolutely perfect!","I got a million compliments."
"10","I rented this dress for a photo shoot.","The theme was Hollywood Glam and Big Beautiful Hats.","The dress was very comfortable and easy to move around in.","It is definitely on my list to rent again for another formal event."
"10","This hugged in all the right places!","It was a perfect dress for my event and I received so many compliments on it.","Not to mention customer service was great getting this to me in less than 24 hours!"
"8","I rented this for my company's black tie awards banquet.","I liked that this dress was short but was a little fancier with the sequins.","(I generally don't care for long dresses.)","I would describe the color as more rose gold than yellow gold.","I have blonde hair and fair skin, and the color was very flattering.","This is a very forgiving dress!","It's form fitting without making you feel like you're squeezed into it.","I would rent this one again.","Highly recommend!"
"10","I have always been petite in my upper body and extremely athletic.","I'm 5'9 and typically am a size 4,6,8 due to the fact I had a smaller upper frame and 34B cup.","Depends what fabric were talking about too!","However, because I have been lifting weights my back has grown (odd to add- but figured I'd say it knowing other people lift weights) My lat area is so wide that I was suffocating in a size 6.","If I wasn't as muscular in my back I would've been fine.","I would recommend to go up a size if you are into lifting weights and very broad in your upper body."
"8","Didn't actually wear it.","It fit perfectly.","The fabric is a little thicker, so higher quality.","Felt a bit too conservative for my taste.","I rented it for the color and loved the berry shade of red."
"10","This dress is so sweet.","I loved the print.","The fit is loose with a tie for the waist, which means it should flatter most figures.","Another win from Kate Spade!"
"10","Fit was great.","Maybe a little tight under the arms."
"10","I was nervous of it looking cheap when it arrived but I received a ton of compliments on it and it had built in support.","I am a 36D and there was still that I was able to wear a bra with it with no problem.","Wore with 3-4 heels and it was perfect length."
"10","The dress was very flattering and fit perfectly through my stomach and hips.","I have a booty so I always worry about how things are going to fit, but this was amazing.","I have a small chest and didn't fill out the built in bra as much as I would have liked, but it still looked great and I was comfortable in it.","The dress had more stretch and give than I thought it would.","I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy dancing and while I couldn't bust out break dance moves, I was able to dance without feeling completely restricted.","I am always a zero in dresses and this fit true to size.","I'm short, 5'3 and I thought the length was perfect with a heel.","Overall I'm very pleased with my order!!","Thank you RTR!"
