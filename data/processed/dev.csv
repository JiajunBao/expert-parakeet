"8","Somehow the color was different from my expectation, but loved it.","It is more smoky salmon pink rather than baby pink."
"10","Wore this w/ red patent pumps to match the red flashes in the sequins.","The party theme was New Orleans, so I thought, Perfect!","I was way overdressed for the crowd, but my husband I had a ball.","Got so many compliments the whole night!"
"8","Rented this for everyday wear.","Great leather bomber.","Beautiful rust red color"
"10","I felt like a movie star in head to toe sparkles.","The dress moves like a dream and is delicious to spin around in.","I was steeped in compliments all night long and felt sexy, glamorous and fun!","Easy to wear, dance in, sit and pose.","A little chafing under the pits, but nothing I couldn't put up with as a price for wearing this showstopper."
"10","The dress fit perfectly - the material does stretch so it hugs your curves and is comfortable.","I expected to need to wear a long since I am 5'11'', but the regular was the perfect length with flats (so it does run long).","I received a lot of compliments and never wanted to take it off!"
"10","Absolutely love this jacket -- with dark jeans and a nice t shirt, it's equally perfect for a casual work environment or drinks with friends."
"4","I so wanted to love this dress.","The neckline is fantastic and I like the pattern on top.","However, the pattern accentuated my belly fat and made it stand out!","No thanks.","I did not wear this out to the wedding as planned.","Also my husband didn't like the dress, he didn't understand the mixed patterns, haha.","Thick fabric hid imperfections (except tummy) and my butt looked awesome in it.","I've been looking at other dresses by this designer, hoping to find one that's better."
"8","While it fit there were simply too many pleats and I felt swallowed up by the fabric.","The leg slit was not visible while walking."
"10","Seriously though, I forgot to take a picture, but I've got 34DDD boobs, a tiny waist, and some thighs and the dress is tight but tight in the right places.","If you like yourself, you will like this dress.","I know I looked good.","Sorry that I don't have photographic evidence!"
"10","Fit like a dream.","A little tight in the chest but all my clothes usually are.","This hit right at the knee.","I got so many compliments on the color and on the little bow!"
