You've found the dress you're looking for. This is tops! Quality matches price! \n\nAbout me: I am 5'8' and 141 lbs. I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \n\nRE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you're a 4/6 girl and you've been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you'll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!

I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn't fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\n\nRE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today's trends, most gals would say it's way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it's illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn't mind one bit. If that's a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \n\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring.

If you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top. I found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders, even when I wore the smaller of my two selected sizes. The dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders. Probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types. Both the 8 and the 10 fit but the 10 was really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole.

But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.  \n1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).\n2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.\n3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).\n\nThe dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.
